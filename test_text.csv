SherylSandberg_2010W, a couple of years ago i was in new york and i was pitching a deal and i was in one of those fancy new york private equity offices you can picture  and i'm in the meeting it's about a three hour meeting and two hours in there kind of needs to be that bio break and everyone stands he doesn't know where the women 's room is in his office so i start looking around for moving boxes figuring they just moved in but i don't see any and so i said did you just move into this and he said no we've been here  the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year and he looked at me and he said  how are we going to fix  how do we change these numbers at the top how do we make this different i want to start out by saying i talk about this about keeping women in the workforce because i really think that's the answer so for any of us in this room today let 's start out by admitting we're lucky in the high income part of our workforce in the people who end up at the top fortune five hundred ceo jobs or the equivalent in other industries  the problem i am convinced is that women are dropping out today i want to focus on what we can do as individuals what are the messages we need to tell ourselves what are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us we don't live in the world our mothers lived in our grandmothers lived in where career choices for women were so limited i want to be very clear that this speech comes with no judgments i don't have the right answer i don't even have it for myself i left san francisco where i live on monday and i was getting on the plane for this conference and my daughter who 's three when i dropped her off at preschool did that whole hugging the leg crying mommy don't get on the plane thing this is hard at home or whether they're in the workforce don't feel that sometimes so i'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone my talk today is about what the messages are if you do want to stay in the workforce and i think there are three one sit at the table two make your partner a real partner  and three  don't leave before you leave number one sit at the table  just a couple weeks ago at facebook we hosted a very senior government official and he came in to meet with senior execs from around silicon valley and sat at the table and then he had these two women who were traveling with him who were pretty senior in his department and i kind of said to them sit at the table come on sit at the table and if you're in this room today most of us grew up in a world where we had basic civil rights and amazingly we still live in a world where some women don't have it with my roommate carrie who was then a brilliant literary student and went on to be a brilliant literary scholar and my brother smart guy but a water polo playing pre med who was a sophomore the three of us take this class together and then carrie reads all the books in the original greek and latin goes to all the lectures i read all the books in english and go to most of the my brother is kind of busy he reads one book of twelve and goes to a couple of lectures marches himself up to our room a couple days before the exam to get himself tutored the three of us go to the exam together and we sit down and we sit there for three hours and our little blue notebooks yes i'm that old and we walk out and we look at each other and we say how did you do and carrie says boy i feel like i didn't really draw out the main point on the hegelian dialectic i got the top grade in you got the top grade in you don't know anything the problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows  women systematically underestimate their own abilities if you test men and women and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like gpa 's men get it wrong slightly high and women get it wrong slightly  but all that aside we still have a problem and it's a real problem and the problem is this if you ask men why they did a good job they'll say i 'm awesome it matters a lot because no one gets to the corner office by sitting on the side not at the table and no one gets the promotion if they don't think they deserve their success or they don't even understand their own success wish the answer were easy i wish i could just go tell all the young women i work with all these fabulous women believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself own your own success i wish i could tell that to my daughter women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world  because what the data shows above all else is one thing  which is that success and likability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women  and everyone 's nodding because we all know this to be true there's a really good study that shows this really well there's a famous harvard business school study on a woman named heidi roizen and she's an operator in a company in silicon valley and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture in two thousand and two not so long ago a professor who was then at columbia university took that case and made it howard roizen and he gave case out both of them to two groups of he changed exactly one word  but that one word made a really he then surveyed the students and the good news was the students both men and women thought heidi and howard were equally competent and the bad news was that this is the complication we have to tell our daughters and our colleagues we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the a to reach for the promotion to sit at the table and we have to do it in a world where for them there are sacrifices they will make for even though for their brothers there are not thing about all of this is that it's really hard to remember this and i'm about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me but i think important i gave this talk at facebook not so long ago  a couple hours later there was a young woman who works there sitting outside my little desk  and she wanted to talk to me i said okay and she sat down and we talked and she said i learned something today i learned that i need to keep my hand up i thought to myself wow if it's me who cares about this obviously giving this talk during this talk i can't even notice that the men 's hands are still raised and the women 's hands are still raised how good are we as managers of our companies and our organizations at seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities more than women make your partner a real partner data shows this very clearly she's got three jobs or two jobs and he 's got one who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home the causes of this are really complicated and i don't have time to go into them and i don't think sunday football watching and general laziness is the i think the cause is more complicated i think as a society we put more pressure on our boys to succeed that we do on our girls i know men that stay home and work in the home to support wives with careers and it's hard  when i go to the mommy and me stuff and i see the father there i notice that the other mommies don't play with him  and if that wasn't good enough motivation for everyone out there they also have more how shall i say this on this stage they know each other more in the biblical sense as  don't leave before you leave how am i going to fit this into everything else i'm doing and literally from that moment she doesn't raise her hand anymore she doesn't look for a promotion she doesn't take on the new project she doesn't say me i want to do that she starts leaning back  the problem is that let 's say she got pregnant that day that day nine months of pregnancy three months of maternity leave six months to catch your breath even in the non profit world a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women women at the top twenty percent  fast forward two years more often and as i've seen it women start thinking about this way earlier  when they get engaged when they get married when they start thinking about trying to have a child which can take a long time one woman came to see me about this and i kind of looked at her she looked a little young and i said so are you and your husband thinking about having a baby and she said oh no i'm not married she didn't even have a about this just way too been through this and i'm here to tell you once you have a child at home your job better be really good to go back because it's hard to leave that  to be challenging it needs to be rewarding you need to feel like you're making a difference and if two years ago don't leave before you leave stay in keep your foot on the gas pedal until the very day you need to leave to take a break for a child and then make your decisions don't make decisions too far in advance particularly ones you're not even conscious you're making we also have another problem which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment i'm hopeful that future generations can i think a world that was run where half of our countries and half of our companies were run by women would be a better world and it's not just  would know where the women 's bathroom are even though that would be very helpful i think it would be a better world have two children i have a five year old son and a three year old daughter i want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home and i want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed but to be liked for a recent study in the u s showed that of married senior managers two thirds of the married men had children and only one third of the married women had children ,tip for any of us in this room today let's start out by admitting we're lucky we don't live in the world are mothers lived in our grandmother's lives in Weir career choices for women were so limited and if you're in this room today most of us grew up in world where we have basic civil rights and amazingly we still live in a world where some women don't have them. all that aside we still have a problem and it's a real problem and the problem is this women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world the numbers tell the story quite clearly 190 heads of state nine or women of all the people in Parliament in the world 13% are women in the corporate sector women at the top sea level jobs board seats tops out at 15 16% the numbers have not moved since 2002 and are going in the wrong direction even in the non-profit world a world we sometimes think of is being led by more women women at the top 20%. we also have another problem which is that woman's face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment a recent study in the US showed that of senior managers of married senior managers 2/3 of the married men had children and only one-third of the married women had children. couple years ago I was in New York and I was pitching a deal and I was in one of those fancy New York private Equity offices you you can picture and I'm in the meeting it's about a three-hour meeting and two hours in his kind of needs to be that fire break and everyone stand up and a part of running a meeting starts looking really embarrassed and I realized he doesn't know where the woman's room is in his office so I start looking around for moving boxes figuring they just moved in but I don't see any and so I said so did you just move into this office and he said no we've been here about a year and I said are you telling me that I'm the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year and he looked at me and he said yeah or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom. so the question is how are we going to fix this. how do we change these numbers at the top how do we make this difference I want to start out by saying I talk about this about keeping women in the workforce because I really think that's the answer in the high-income part of our Workforce in the people who end up at the top Fortune 500 CEO jobs for the equivalent in other Industries the problem I am convinced is that women are dropping out now people talk about this a lot and they talk about things like Flex time and mentoring programs company should have to train women I want to talk about none of that today even though that's all really important today I want to focus on what we can do as individuals what are the messages we need to tell ourselves what are the messages we tell the women that work with him for us one of the messages we tell our daughters. at the outset I want to be very clear that the speech comes with no judgments I don't have the right answer I don't even have it for myself I left San Francisco where I live on Monday and I was getting on the plane for this conference and my daughter who's three when I dropped her off at preschool did that whole hugging the leg crying mommy don't get on the plane thing this is hard I feel guilty sometimes I don't know women whether they're at home or whether they're in the workforce that don't feel that sometimes so I'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone my talk today is about what the messages are if you do want to stay in the workforce and I think there are three. one sit at the table to make your partner a real partner. and three don't leave before you leave. number one sit at the table just a couple weeks ago at Facebook we hosted a very senior government official and he came in to meet with senior execs from around Silicon Valley and kind of sat at the table and then he had these two women who were traveling with him we're pretty senior in his apartment and I kind of said to them sit at the table come sit at the table and I sat on the side of the room. when I was in college my senior year I took a course called European intellectual history that you love that kind of thing from college wish I could do that now and I took it with my roommate carry who was then a brilliant literary student and went on to be a brilliant literary scholar and my brother smart guy but a water polo playing pre-med who has a sophomore the three of us take this class together and then he reads all the books in the original Greek and Latin goes to all the lectures I read all the books in English and go to most of the lectures my brother is kind of busy he reads one book at 12 and goes to a couple of lectures marches himself up to our room a couple days before the exam to get himself tutor. the three of us go to the exam together and we sit down and we study Fiona sit there for three hours and our Little Pony notebooks yes on that old and we walked out we look at each other and we say how'd you do. I'm Terry says boy I feel like I didn't really try out the main point on the hegelian dialectic and I thank God I really wish I had really connected John Locke's theory of property the philosophers that follow and my brother says I got the top rated in the class. you got the top grade in the class you don't know anything. the problem with these stories is that should they show what the data shows women systematically underestimate their own abilities if you test men and women and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like GTA men get it wrong slightly high and women get it wrong slightly low women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce a study in the last two years of people entering the workforce at a college showed that 57% of boys entering or men I guess our negotiating are for salary and only 7% of women. and most importantly men attribute their success to themselves and women attributed to other external factors if you ask men why they did a good job they'll say I'm awesome if you ask obviously why are you even asking if you ask women why they did a good job what they'll say is someone help them they got lucky they worked really hard. why does this matter boy it matters a lot because no one gets to the corner office by sitting on the side not at the table and no one gets the promotion if they don't think they deserve their success or they don't even understand their own success. I wish the answer for easy I wish I could just go to all the young women I work for all these fabulous Women Believe In Yourself you douche it for yourself own your own success I wish I could tell that to my daughter. it's not that simple because what the data shows above all else is one thing which is at success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women and everyone's not in cuz we all know this to be true there's a really good study that shows this really well there's a famous Harvard Business School study on a woman named Heidi Verizon and she's a operator in a venture capital company in Silicon Valley and she uses her contacts to become a very successful Venture capitalists in 2002 not so long ago a professor who is Bennett Columbia University took that case and made it Heidi Verizon and you gave that taste out both of them to two groups of students he changed exactly one word Heidi to Howard but that one word made a really big difference. he done surveyed the students and the good news was the students both men and women thought Heidi and Howard were equally confident and that's good the bad news was that everyone liked our he's a great guy you want to work for him you want to spend the day fishing with him but Heidi not so sure she's a little out for herself she's a little political you're not sure you'd want to work for her. this is the complication we have to tell our daughter and our colleagues we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the a to reach for the promotion to sit at the table and we have to do it in the world refers them there are sacrifices they will make for that even though for their brothers there will not. the saddest thing about all of this is that it's really hard to remember this and I'm about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me but I think the important I gave this talk at Facebook not so long ago to about 100 employees a couple hours later there was a young woman who works there sitting kind of outside my little desk and she wanted to talk to me and I said Okay and she sat down and we talked and she said I learned something today I learned that I need to keep my hand up I said what do you mean she said we were getting this talk and then you said you're going to take two more questions and I had my hand up with lots of other people and then you took two more questions and I put my hand down and I noticed all the women put their hand down and then you took more questions. only from the men. and I thought to myself wow if it's me who cares about this obviously giving this talk during this talk I can't even notice. that the men's hands are still raised in the woman's hands are still raised how good are we as managers of our companies in our organizations at seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities more than women. we've got to get women to sit at the table. number two. message number to make your partner a real partner I've become convinced that we made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home the data shows this very clearly. if a woman and a man work full time and have a child the woman does twice the amount of housework to manda's and the woman does three times the amount of childcare the man. Cuz she's got three jobs are two jobs and he's got one who do you think's drops out when someone needs to be home or the causes of this are really complicated and I don't have time to go into them and I don't think Sunday football watching in general laziness is the cause I think the cause is more complicated I think as a society we put more pressure on our boys to succeeds and we do on our girl I know man that stay home and work in the home to support why is it for years and it's hard when I go to the mommy and me stuff and I see the father there I noticed that the other mommies don't play with him. and that's a problem because we have to make it as important a job cuz it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home for people of both genders if we're going to even things out and let him stay in the workforce. studies show that households with equal learning and equal responsibility also have half the divorce rate and if that wasn't good enough motivation for everyone out there they also have more how should I say dishonest did they know each other more in the biblical sense as well. message number three don't leave before you leave I think there's a really deep irony to the fact that actions women are taking and I see this all the time with the objective of staying in the workforce actually lead to their eventually leaving here's what happens we're all busy everyone's busy a woman's busy and she starts thinking about having a child and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child she said thinking about making room for that child how am I going to fit this into everything else I'm doing and literally from that moment she doesn't fit razor hand anymore she doesn't look for a promotion she doesn't take on the new project she doesn't say any I want to do that she starts leaning back. the problem is at let's say she got pregnant that day that day 9 months of pregnancy three months of maternity leave six months to catch your breath fast forward 2 years more often and as I've seen it women start thinking about this way earlier when they get engaged when they get married when they start thinking about trying to have a childish and take a long time one woman came to see me about this and I kind of looked at her she looks at all the young and I said so are you and your husband thinking about having a baby and she said oh no I'm not married she didn't even have a boyfriend I said you're thinking about this just way too early but the point is that what happened once you start kind of quietly leaning back. everyone who's been through this and I'm here to tell you once you have a child at home your job better be really good to go back because it's hard to leave a kid at home your job needs to be challenging it needs to be rewarding you need to feel like you're making a difference and if 2 years ago you didn't take a promotion and some guy next to you dead if 3 years ago you stop looking for new opportunities you're going to be bored because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal. don't leave before you leave stay in keep your foot on the gas pedal until the very day you need to leave to take to take a break for a child and then make your decision don't make decisions too far in advance particularly ones you're not even conscious you're making. my generation really sadly is not going to change the numbers at the top they're just not moving we are not in yet two were 50% of the population in my generation there will not be 50% of people at the top of any industry. but I'm hopeful that future Generations can. I think the world that was run or half of our countries and half of our companies are run by women would be a better world and it's not just because people would know where the women's bathroom are even though that would be very helpful I think it would be a better world. I have two children I have a 5 year old son and a two-year-old daughter I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce are at home and I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed but to be like for her accomplishments thank you.Sharon Bus video on the human Network Cisco welcome to the human Network,0.8359375
YochaiBenkler_2005G,in some contexts it's even more efficient because of the quality of the information the ability to find the best person the lower transaction costs it's sustainable and growing fast but and this is the dark it is threatened by in the same way that it threatens the incumbent industrial systems so next time you open the paper and you see an intellectual property decision a telecoms decision it's not about something small and technical it is about the future of the freedom to be as social beings with each other and the way information knowledge and culture will be produced because it is in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will be for the industrial information economy to simply go on as it goes or for the new model of production to begin to develop alongside that industrial model and change the way we begin to see the world and report what it is that we see thank you  revolution but in fact for purposes of understanding what's happening today that's wrong because for one hundred and fifty years we've had an information economy it's just been industrial which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money to pay those two and a half million dollars and later more for the telegraph and the radio transmitter and the television and eventually the mainframe the problems of writing and working and looking at the internet is that it's very hard to separate fashion and that meant they were market based or they were government owned depending on what kind of system they were in and this characterized and anchored the way information and knowledge were produced for the next one hundred and fifty years now let me tell you a different story around june two thousand and two the world of supercomputers had a bombshell the japanese had for the first time created the fastest supercomputer the nec earth simulator taking the primary from the us and about two years later this by the way is measuring the trillion floating point operations per second that the computer 's capable of running sigh of relief ibm gene blue has just edged ahead of the nec earth simulator all of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period there's another supercomputer running in the world seti at home four and a half million users around the world contributing their leftover computer cycles whenever their computer isn't working by running a screen saver and together sharing their resources to create a massive supercomputer that nasa harnesses to analyze the data coming from radio telescopes what this  picture suggests to us is that we've got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitalized  happens is radically distributed each of us in these advanced economies has one of these or something rather like it a computer they're not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network and computation storage and communications capacity are in the hands of practically every connected person  and these are the basic physical capital means necessary for producing information knowledge and culture in the hands of something like six hundred million to a billion people around the planet  what this means is that for the first time since the industrial revolution the most important means the most important components of the core economic activities remember we are in an information economy of the most advanced economies and there more than anywhere else are in the hands of the population at large james gordon bennett founded the first mass circulation newspaper in new york city and it cost about five hundred dollars to start it which was about the equivalent of ten thousand dollars of today  and we've got human creativity human wisdom human experience the other major experience the other major input which unlike simple labor stand here turning this lever all day long is not something that's the same or fungible among people any one of you who has taken someone else's job or tried to give yours to someone else no matter how detailed the manual you cannot transmit what you know what you will intuit under a certain set of circumstances in that we're unique and each of us holds this critical  into production as we hold this machine what's the effect  this so the story that most people know is the story of free or open source software this is market share of apache web server wow this is really important the web we need a much better web server one was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided you know we really need this we should write one and what are we going to do with what well we're gonna share it and other people will be able to develop it the other was microsoft now if i told you that ten years later the motley crew of people who didn't control anything that they produced right but in fact of course the story is it's the seventy percent including the major e commerce site seventy percent of a critical application on which web based communications and applications work is produced in this form in direct competition with microsoft not in a side issue in a central strategic decision to try to capture a component of the  nasa at some point did an experiment where they took images of mars that they were mapping and they said instead of having three or four fully trained phds doing this all the time let 's break it up into small components  put it up on the web and see if people using a very simple interface will actually spend five minutes here ten minutes there clicking after six months eighty five thousand people used this to generate mapping at a faster rate than the images were coming in which was quote practically indistinguishable from the markings of a fully trained phd once you showed it to a number of people and computed  average now if you have a little girl and she goes and writes to well not so little medium little which is vastly better than what you'll find in the encyclopedia com which is barbie klaus on the other hand if they go to wikipedia they'll find a genuine article and i won 't talk a lot about wikipedia because jimmy wales is here but  roughly equivalent to what you would find in the britannica differently written including the controversies over body image and commercialization the claims about the way in which she's a good role model et cetera another portion is not only how content is produced but how relevance is produced the claim to fame of yahoo was we hire people to look originally not anymore ten thousand two and a half million fifteen years that's the critical change that is being we hire people to look at websites and tell you if they're in the index they're good this on the other hand is what sixty thousand passionate volunteers produce in the open directory project each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about to say this is good so this is the open directory project with sixty thousand volunteers each one spending a little bit of time as opposed to a few hundred fully paid employees no one owns it no one owns the output it's free for anyone to use and it's the output of people acting out of social and psychological motivations to do something interesting  this is not only outside of businesses when you think of what is the critical innovation of google the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing the decision about what's relevant to the community of the web as a whole doing whatever they want to do so page rank the critical innovation here is instead of our engineers or our people saying which is the most relevant we're going to go out there and count what you people out there on the web for whatever reason vanity pleasure produced links  and tied to each other we're going to count those and count them up and again here you see barbie com but also very quickly adiosbarbie com the body image for every size a contested cultural object by the net and that's what i want to talk about today and how that relates to the emergence of social production starting with newspapers what we saw was which you won 't find anywhere soon on overture which is the classic market based mechanism whoever pays the most is highest on the list so all of that is in the creation of content of relevance basic human expression but remember the computers were also physical just physical materials our pcs we share them together we also see this in wireless it used to be wireless was one person owned the license they transmitted in an area and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property what we're seeing now is that computers and radios are becoming so sophisticated that we're developing algorithms to let people own machines like wi fi devices and overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this to build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle when i'm listening when i'm not using i can help you transfer your messages and when you're not using you'll help me transfer yours and this is not an idealized version these are working models that at least in some places in the united states are being implemented at least for public security it's got to be robust to attack including closing the main index injecting malicious files armed seizure of some major nodes high cost as an initial requirement for making information knowledge and culture take years it would take millions but of course what i'm describing is p we always think of it as stealing music but fundamentally it's a distributed data storage and retrieval system where people for very obvious reasons are willing to share their bandwidth and their storage to create something so essentially what we're seeing is the emergence of a fourth transactional framework it used to be that there were two primary dimensions along which you could divide it was too expensive to have decentralized social production to have decentralized action in society that was not about society itself it was in fact economic but what we're seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system of social sharing and exchange not that it's the first time that we do nice things to each other or for each other as social beings we do it all the time it's that it's the first time that it's having major economic impact what characterizes them is decentralized which led to a stark bifurcation between producers who had to be able to raise financial capital just like any other industrial you don't have to ask permission as you do in a property based system may i do this it's open for anyone to create and innovate and share  if they want to by themselves or with others because property is one mechanism of coordination but it's not the only one you don't increase the probability of being invited back and if dinner isn't entirely obvious think of sex it also requires certain new organizational approaches and in particular what we've seen is task organization you have to hire people who know what they're doing you have to hire them to spend a lot of time now take the same problem chunk it into little modules and motivations become trivial five minutes instead of watching tv five minutes i'll spend just because it's interesting just because it's fun  just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning or in places that are more involved like wikipedia gives me a certain set of social relations so a new social phenomenon is emerging it's creating and it's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition as you see a new set of social relations and behaviors emerging you have new opportunities some of them are toolmakers instead of building well behaved appliances things that you know what they'll do in advance you begin to build more open tools there's a new set of values a new set of things people value you build platforms for self expression and collaboration like wikipedia like the open directory project you're beginning to build platforms and you see that as a model  and you see surfers people who see this happening and in some sense build it into a supply chain which is a very curious one right you have a belief stuff will flow out of connected human beings give me something i can use and i'm going to contract with someone i will deliver something based on what happens it's very scary that's what google does essentially that's what ibm does in software services and they've done reasonably well so social production is a real fact not a it is the critical long term shift caused by the internet social relations and exchange become significantly more important than they ever were as an economic phenomenon  now the term information society information economy for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after the industrial ,"one of the problems of writing and working and looking at the internet is that it's very hard to separate fashion from Deep change and so it to start helping that I want to take us back to 1835b + 1835 James Gordon Bennett founded the first mass circulation newspaper in New York City and it cost about $500 to started which was about about the equivalent of $10,000 of today by 15 years later by 1850 doing the same thing starting what was experienced as a mass circulation daily paper would come to cost two and a half million dollars 10000 2 and a half million 15 years that's the critical change that is being inverted. by the net and that's what I want to talk about today and how that relates to the emergence of social production starting with newspapers what we saw was high cost as an initial requirement for making information knowledge and culture which led to a stark bifurcation between producers who had to be able to raise Financial Capital just like any other industrial organization and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of things that this industrial model could produce. now the term Information Society information economy for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after the Industrial Revolution but in fact for purposes of understanding what's happening today that's wrong because for 150 years we'd had an information economy it's just been industrial which means those were producing at the have a way of raising money to pay those two and a half million dollars and later more for the Telegraph and the radio transmitter and the television and eventually the Mainframe and that meant they were market-based or they were government-owned depending on what kind of system they were in and is characterized and anchored the way information and knowledge were produced for the next hundred and fifty years. now let me tell you a different story around June 2002 the world of supercomputers had a bombshell the Japanese had for the first time. The fastest supercomputer the NEC Earth simulator taking the primary from the US in about two years later this by the way is measuring the not the trillion floating-point operations per second capable that the computer is capable of running fibrolief IBM Jean blue has just edged ahead of any cigarettes simulator all of this computer running in the world said you at home for and a half million users around the world contributing their leftover computer Cycles whenever their computer isn't working by running a screen saver and together. sharing their resources to create a massive super computer that NASA harnesses to analyze the data coming from radio telescopes what this. picture suggest to us is that we've brought a radical change in the way information production and exchanged is capitalized not that it's become less capital-intensive that's required ownership of this Capital the way that happens is radically distributed each of us in these advanced economies has one of these or something rather like it a computer they're not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network and computation storage and Communications capacity are in the hands of practically every connected person. and these are the basic physical capital means necessary for producing information knowledge and culture in the hands of something like 600 million to a billion people around the planet. what this means is that for the first time. since the Industrial Revolution the most important means the most important components of the core economic activities remember we are in an information economy. of the most advanced economies and they're more than anywhere else are in the hands of the population at large this is completely different than what we've seen since the Industrial Revolution so we got Communications and computation capacity in the hands of the entire population and we've got human creativity human wisdom Human Experience the other major experience the other major input switch on like simple labor stand here turning this labor all day long is not something that's the same or fungible among people any one of you who has taken someone else's job or tried to give yours but someone else no matter how did tail the manual you cannot transmit. what you know what you willing to it under a certain set of circumstances in that we are unique and each of us holds this critical in put into production as we hold this machine what's the effect of this to the story that most people know is the story of free or open source software this is market share of Apache web server one of the critical applications in web-based Communications in 1995 two groups of people said wow this is really important we need a much better web server one was a Motley collection of volunteers who just decided you know we really need this we should write one and what are we going to do with what we were going to share it and other people will be able to develop it the other was Microsoft not if I told you that Ten Years Later the motley crew of people who didn't control anything that they produced acquired 20%.. marketing what's the redline he would be amazing I think of any minivans a group of automobile Engineers on their weekends are competing with Toyota 70% including the major e Commerce side 70% of a credit application on which web-based Communications and applications work is produced in this form in direct competition with Microsoft not in a side issue in a central strategic decision to try to capture a component of the net. software has done this in a way that's been very visible because it's measurable but the thing to see is that this actually happens throughout the web. so NASA at some point during an experiment where they took images of Mars that they were mapping and they said instead of having three or four fully trained phds doing the song time let's break it up into small components put it up on the web and see if people using a very simple interface will actually spend 5 minutes or 10 minutes they're clicking off the six months 85,000 people use this to generate mapping at a faster rate than the images were coming in which was quote practically indistinguishable from the markings of a fully trained PhD once you showed it to a number of people and computed the average price to do research on Barbie and she'll come to Encarta one of the main online encyclopedias this is what you'll find out about Barbie this is it. there's nothing more to the definition including manufacturers plural now more commonly produced ethnically diverse dolls like this black Barbie which is vastly better than what you'll find in the encyclopedia.com which is Barbie house. on the other hand if they go to Wikipedia they'll find a genuine article is here but roughly equivalent to what you would find in the Britannica differently written including the controversies over body image and commercialization the claims about. the waynewood she's are good role model at cetera. another portion is not only how content is produced by the relevance is produced the plaintiff aim of Yahoo was we hire people to look originally not anymore we hire people to look at web sites and tell you if they're in the index they're good that's on the other hand is what 60,000 passionate volunteers produce in the open directory project each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about the say this is good. so this is the open directory project with 60,000 volunteers each one spending a little bit of time supposed to a few hundred fully paid employees no one owns it it's free for anyone to use and it's the output of people acting out of Social and psychological motivations to do something interesting this is not only outside of businesses when you think of what is the critical innovation of Google the critical Innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing the decision about what's relevant. to the community of the web as a as a whole doing whatever they want to do so pagerank the critical Innovation here is instead of our Engineers are our people saying which is the most relevant we're going to go out and count want you people out there on the web for whatever reason vanity pleasure produced. anti to each other we're going to count those and count them up and again here you see barbie.com but also very quickly at the office barbie.com the body image prairieside I can test the cultural object which you won't find anywhere soon on Overture which is the classic market-based mechanism whoever pays the most is highest on the list of relevance basic human expression but remember the computers were also physical just the physical materials Arkham PCS we share them together we also see this in Wireless it used to be Wireless was one person on the license they transmitted in a in an area and it had to be decided whether that be licensed or based on property what we're seeing now is that computers and and and radios are becoming so sophisticated that we're developing algorithms to let people own machine like Wi-Fi devices and overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow it. Community like this to build its own Wireless Broadband Network simply from the simple principle when I'm listening when I'm not using I can help you transfer your messages and when you're not using you'll help me transfer yours and this is not an idealized version these are working models that at least in some places in United States are being implemented at least for public security let's build a data storage and retrieval system it's got a store terabytes go to be available 24 hours a day 7 days a week going to be available from anywhere in the world it has to support over 100 million users at any given moment it's got to be robust to attack including closing the main index injecting malicious files arm seizure of some major nodes but of course what I'm describing our Pete is P2P file-sharing. why we always think of it as just stealing music but fundamentally it's a distributed data storage and retrieval system where people for very obvious reasons are willing to share their brought their bandwidth and their storage to create something so essentially what we are seeing is the emergence of a fourth transactional framework it used to be that there were two primary Dimensions along with you could divide things they could be market-based or non market-based it could be decentralized or centralized the price system was a market-based and decentralized system if things worked better because you actually had somebody organizing them you had firms if you want to be in the market or you had governments or sometimes large or nonprofits in the non-market it was too expensive to have decentralised social production you have be centralized section. in society that was not about Society itself that was in fact economic but what we're seeing now is the emergence of this for system of social sharing and exchange not that it's the first time that we do nice things to each other one for each other as social beings we do it all the time. if I did the first time that it's having major economic impact what characterizes them is decentralized Authority you don't have to ask permission as you do in a property base system may I do this it's open for anyone to create and innovate and share if they want to by themselves or with others because property is one mechanism of coordination but it's not the only one instead what we see our social Frame Works for all of the critical things that we use property and contract in the market information flows to decide what are interesting problems who's available and good for something motivation structures rent money isn't always the best motivator if you leave a $50 check after dinner with friends you don't increase the probability of being invited back. and if dinner isn't entirely obvious think of sex. it also requires certain the organizational approaches and in particular what we've seen is pass working as they should hire people who know what they're doing you have to hire them to spend a lot of time now take the same problem chunk it into little modules and motivations become trivial 5 minutes instead of watching TV 5 minutes I'll spend just because it's interesting just because it's fun just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning or in places that are more involved like Wikipedia gives me a certain set of social relations. so a new social phenomenon is emerging it's creating and is most visible when we see it as a new form of competition.. assaulting the recording industry free and open source software taking market share from Microsoft potentially threatening traditional telecoms Wikipedia competing with online encyclopedias but it also has new sorts of opportunities for businesses as you see if you said of social relations and behaviors emerging you have new opportunities some of them are toolmakers instead of building well-behaved appliances things that you know what they'll do an advance you begin to build more open tools there's a new set of values and you said of things people value you build platforms for self-expression and collaboration like Wikipedia like the open directory project you're beginning to build platforms and you see that as a model and you see Surfers people who see this happening and in some sense build it into a supply chain which is a very curious one right you have. that'll give me something I can use and I'm going to contact with someone I will deliver something based on what happened to the very scary that's what Google does essentially that's what I B M doesn't software services and reasonably well so social production is a real fact not a fact it is very critical long-term shift caused by the internet social relations and exchange become significantly more important than they ever were as an economic phenomenon in some contexts it even more efficient because of the quality of the information the ability to find the best person the lower transaction costs its sustainable and growing fast but and this is the dark lining. it is threatened by in the same way that it threatens the incumbent Industrial Systems so next time you open the paper and you see an intellectual property decision a telecoms decision it's not about something small and Technical it is about the future of the freedom to be as social beings with each other and the way information knowledge and culture will be produced because it is in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will be. for the industrial information economy to Simply go on as it goes or for the new model of production to begin to develop alongside that industrial model and change the way we begin to see the world and Report what it is that we see thank you",0.7890625
JohnWooden_2001,every shot that is taken they assumed would be missed i've had too many that stand around and wait to see if it's missed then they go and it's too late somebody else is in there ahead of  they weren't very quick but they played good position kept in good balance and so they played pretty good defense for us so they had qualities that they came close to as close to reaching possibly their full potential as any players i ever had so i consider them to be as successful as lewis alcindor or bill walton  players have i rambled enough i was told that when he makes his appearance i was supposed to shut up in the classroom or more points in some athletic contest i thought about that for quite a spell and i wanted to come up with my own definition i thought that might help and i knew how mister webster defined it as the accumulation of material possessions or the attainment of a position of power or prestige or something i coined my own definition of success in nineteen hundred and thirty four when i was teaching at a high school in south bend indiana being a little bit of that sort worthy accomplishments perhaps but in my opinion not necessarily indicative of success so i wanted to come up with something southern indiana and dad tried to teach me and my brothers that you should never try to be better than someone else i'm sure at the time he did that i didn't it well somewhere i guess in the hidden recesses of my mind it popped out years later never try to be better than someone else always learn from others never cease trying to be the best you can be that's under your  simple verse that said at god 's footstool to confess a poor soul knelt and bowed his head i failed he cried the master said thou didst thy best that is success from those things and one other perhaps i coined my own definition of success which is peace of mind attained only through self satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you're capable i believe that's true if you make the effort to to the best of which you're capable try and improve the situation that exists for you i think that's success and i don't think others can judge that i think it's like character and reputation your reputation is what you are perceived to be your character is what you really are and i think much more important than what you are perceived to be you'd hope they'd both be good but they won 't necessarily be the same well that was my idea that i was going to try to get across to the youngsters i ran across other things i love to teach and it was mentioned the previous speaker that i enjoy poetry and i dabble in it a bit and love it there are some things that helped me i think be better than i would have been i know i'm not what i ought to be not what i should be but i think i'm better than i would have been if i hadn't run across certain things one was just a little verse that said  no  written word no spoken plea can teach our youth what they should be nor all the books on all the shelves what the teachers are themselves  that made an impression on me in the nineteen thirties and i tried to use that more or less in my teaching whether it be in sports or whether it be in the english classroom i our farm home and dad would read poetry to us so i always liked it and about the same time i ran across this one verse i ran across another one someone expected their youngsters to get an a or a b they thought a c was all right for the neighbors children because the neighbors children are all average  lady teacher why she taught and she after some time she said she wanted to think about that then she came up and said they ask me why i teach and i reply where could i find such splendid company a statesman strong unbiased wise another daniel webster silver tongued a doctor sits beside him whose quick steady hand may mend a bone or stem the life blood 's flow and there a builder upward rise the arch of a church he builds wherein that minister may speak the word of god and lead a stumbling soul to touch the christ and all about gathering of teachers farmers merchants laborers those who work and vote and build and plan and pray into a great tomorrow and i may say i may not see the church or hear the word or eat the food their hands may grow but yet again i may and later i may say i knew him once and he was weak or strong or bold or proud or gay i knew him once but then he was a boy they ask me why i teach and i reply where could i find such splendid company and i believe the teaching profession it's true you have so many youngsters and i've got to think of my youngsters at ucla thirty some attorneys eleven dentists and doctors many many teachers and other professions and that gives you a great deal of pleasure to see them go on i always tried to make the youngsters feel that they're there to get an education number one basketball was second because it was paying their way but they weren't satisfied when their own would make the teacher feel that they had failed or the youngster had failed and that's not right the good lord in his infinite wisdom didn't create us all equal as far as intelligence is concerned any more than we're equal for  and they do need a little time for social activities but you let social activities take a little precedence over the other two and you're not going to have any very long so that was the ideas that i tried to get across to the youngsters under my supervision i had three rules pretty much that i stuck with practically all the time i'd learned these prior to coming to ucla and i decided they were very important one was never be late never be late later on i said certain things i had players if we're leaving for somewhere had to be neat and clean there was a time when i made them  jackets and shirts and ties then i saw our chancellor coming to school in denims and turtlenecks and i thought not right for me to keep this other so i let them just they had to be neat and clean i had one of my greatest players that you probably heard of bill walton he came to catch the bus we were leaving for somewhere to play and we wasn't clean and neat so i wouldn't let him go he couldn't get on the bus he had to go home and get cleaned up to get to the airport so i was a stickler for that i believed in that i belive in time very important i believe you should be on time but i felt at practice for example we start on time we close on time the youngsters didn't have to the profession most of them are young you know and probably newly married and i tell them don 't run practices late because you'll go home in a bad mood and that's not good for a young married man to go home so i did believe on time i believe starting on time and i believe closing on time and another one i had was not one word of profanity one word of profanity and you are out of here for the day if i see it in a game you're going to come out and sit on the bench the third one was never criticize a  i didn't want that i used to tell them i was paid to do that that's my job i'm paid to do it pitifully poor but i am paid to do it not like the coaches today for gracious sakes no not everybody could earn an a or a b and i didn't like that way of judging it i did know know how the alumni of various schools back in the thirties judged coaches and athletic teams a little different than it was in my day those were three things that i stuck with pretty closely all the time and those actually came from my dad that's what he tried to teach me and my brothers one time i came up with  pyramid eventually that i don't have the time to go on that but that helped me i think become a better teacher  something like this i had blocks in the pyramid and the cornerstones being industriousness and enthusiasm working hard and enjoying what you're doing coming up to the apex you have to have patience to we want things to happen we talk about our youth being impatient a lot and they are not just give it word service believe that things will work out as they should providing we do what we should i think our tendency is to hope that things will turn out the way we want them to much of the time but we don't do the things that are necessary to make those things become reality i worked on this for some fourteen years and i think it helped me become a better teacher but it all revolved around that original definition of success you know a number of years ago there was a major league baseball umpire by the name of george moriarty he spelled moriarty with only one i i'd never seen that before but he did big league baseball players they're very perceptive about those things and they noticed he had only one i in his name you'd be surprised how many also told him that that was one more than he had in his head you won them all you were considered to be reasonably successful not completely because i found out we had a number of years but he wrote something that i think he did while i tried to do in this pyramid he called it the road ahead or the road behind sometimes i think the fates must grin as we denounce them and insist the only reason we the ancient claim we win or lose within ourselves the shining trophies on our shelves can never win tomorrow 's game you and i know deeper down there's always a chance to win the crown but when we fail to give our best we simply haven't met the test of giving all and saving none until the game is really won of showing what is meant by not afraid to fall if bravely we have given all for who can ask more of a man than giving all within his span giving all it seems to me is not so far from victory  best of your ability and no one can do more than that i tried to get across too that my opponents don't tell you you never heard me mention winning never mention winning my idea is that you can lose when you outscore somebody in a game and you can win when you're outscored i've felt that way on certain occasions at various times and i just wanted them to be able to hold their head  but it seemed that we didn't win each individual game by the margin that some of our alumni had predicted and after a game i used to say that when a game is over and you see somebody that didn't know the outcome i hope they couldn't tell by your actions whether you outscored an opponent or the opponent outscored you that's what really matters if you make effort to do the best you can regularly the results will be about what they should be not necessary to what you would want them to be but they will be about what they should and only you will know whether you can do that  and that's what i wanted from them more than anything else and as time went by and i learned more about other things i think it worked a little better as far as the results but i wanted the score of a game to be the byproduct of these other things and not the end itself i believe it was  one great philosopher said no no cervantes cervantes said the journey is better than the end and i like that i think that is it's getting there sometimes when you get there there's almost a decent job during the week it's getting the players to get that self satisfaction in knowing that they'd made the effort to do the best of which they are capable  sometimes i'm asked who was the best player i had or the best teams i can never answer that  about that and they said suppose that you in some way could could make the perfect player what would you want that defense usually wins championships and would work hard on defense but i'd want one that would play offense too i'd want him to be unselfish and look for the pass first and not shoot all the time  i wanted them to be able to shoot from the outside i wanted them to be good inside too  rebound well at both ends too and why not just take someone like but that was true back in the thirties so i understood that keith wilkes and let it go at that he had not the only one but he was one that i in that particular category because i think he made the effort to become the best i mention in my book they call me two players that gave me great satisfaction that came as close as i think anyone i ever had to reach their full potential one was was conrad burke and one was doug mcintosh when i saw them as freshmen on our freshmen team we didn't have freshmen couldn't play varsity when i taught and but i didn't like it and i didn't agree with it and i wanted to come up with something that i hoped could make me a better teacher and give the youngsters under my supervision whether it be in athletics or in the english classroom something to which to aspire other than just a higher mark our varsity must be pretty miserable if he 's good enough to make it and you know one of them was a starting player for the other was his next year he played thirty two minutes in a national championship game did a tremendous job for us and the next year a starting player on the national championship team and here i thought he'd never play a minute when he was so those are the things that give you  great joy and great satisfaction to see one neither one of those youngsters could shoot very well but they had outstanding shooting percentages because they didn't force it and neither one could jump very well  but they get kept good position and so they did well rebounding they remembered that ,"icon my own definition definition of success in 1934 when I was teaching at a high school in South Bend Indiana being a little bit disappointing a delusion. Perhaps by the way parents of the youngsters in my English class is expected their youngsters do too but I got an A or B they thought I see was all right for the neighbors children because the neighbors children all average but they weren't satisfied with their own would make the teacher feel that they had two failed are they concerned anywhere the week was for a size appearance not everybody can earn a r b and I don't like that way of judging and and I did know how the alumni of various schools back in the 30s judge coaches and athletic teams if you want them all and you were considered to be reasonably successful not completely because I found out that we have. Sears at UCLA where we done with the game but it seemed that we didn't win each individual game but the margin there's some of our alumni had predicted and quite frequently on. quite frequent I I really felt that they had backed up their predictions in the more materialistic but I was true back in that 30 or so I understood that I didn't agree with her now I want to come up with something and I hope you could make me a better teacher and give the youngsters under my supervision whether it be an ass I think they're an English Mastiff something which just fire other than just their Mark in the classroom or more points in Snowmass let it contested I thought about that for quite a spell and I want to come up with my own definition I thought that might help and I knew how Mr Webster defined it as the accumulation of material possessions I need to change my new position of power and Prestige or something of that sort where they perhaps but in my opinion not necessarily and success so I don't want to come up something of my own and I recall that I was raised on a small farm in Southern Indiana and Dad tried to teach me and my brothers that you should never try to be better than some. I'm sure at the time he did that I didn't it didn't go somewhere I guess in the hidden recesses of my knee popped out years and later never try to be better than someone else always learn from others and never cease trying to be the best you could be that's under your control and if you get too engrossed involved and concerned in regards to the things over which you have no control it will adversely affect the things over which you have control then I ran across the simple verse that said had God's footstool to confess a porcelain out and about his head I feel he cried the master said now did sniper that is Success from those things and one other perhaps I coined my own definition of success which is peace of mind attained only to self satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of what you're capable I believe that's true if you make me have to do the best thing for you to put your cape on trying to improve the situation that exists for you I think that's success and I don't think others can judge that I know. it's like character and reputation your reputation is what your perceived to be your character is what you really are and I think your character is so much more important than what you are perceived to be you and hope they had no speak good and they don't necessarily be the same well that was my idea that when I was going to try and get the cost of the youngsters I ran across the other things I love to teach and it was mentioned by the previous 7 I figured that that I enjoy poetry and 911 there's some things that help me I didn't think it'd be better than it would have been I don't know what all to be and should be a man and I think I'm better than I would have been if I had to run across certain things and want to know if they're just a little verse that said that no no written word no spoken please can teach our youth what they should be nor all the books on all the shelves is what the teachers are themselves that made an impression on me and you. I tried to use that more or less in my teaching whether it be in sports or whether it be getting into his classroom and we had an interest in that in somehow and I maybe it's because of dad and he used to read to us at night to call La Lampe we didn't have electricity in our farm home and Daddy read poetry to a son is always like that then about the same time that I ran across this one verse I ran across another one. Someone asked a lady teacher why she talked and she after sometimes she said she would think about that and then she came up and said that they asked me why I teach and I reply where can I find such Splendid company there's such a Statesman strong unbiased why is another way to Webster silver tongue. adopter sits beside him whose quick-setting handmade men the moon are still in the Life blood flow. and then rebuild her diaper dry is the arch on that church you bills within that Minister may speak the word of God to lead assembling the school to touch the Christ all about a gathering of teachers farmers-merchants laborers those who work in voting building plan and praying and praying to a great tomorrow and let me say I mean not see the church or here there were deer eat the food their hands make it over there again I may I later I may say I knew him once and he was weak or strong or bowling or proud or gay I knew he wants but then he was a boy they asked me why I teach and I reply where could I find such Splendid company and I believe the teaching profession that's true you have so many youngsters and I got to think of my youngsters UCLA 30 some attorneys Levin dentist and doctors and many many teachers in in in in in other professions and now that gives you a great deal of pleasure to see you then go on always tried to make things just feel that they're there. l'education number one basketball with second cuz he's paying their way and they do need a little time for social activities social activities take a very long so that was the idea is that I am trying to to get across to the youngsters and I know these prior to come and get you CLA and I decided they were very important one must never be late never be late later on I had I said certain things that I had the players if we're leaving for someone they had to be neat and clean there was a time when I I made them wear jackets and shirts and ties with cancer coming to school and longer and then I'm going to keep this other so I let him eat and clean and I had one. where's that you probably heard of the Walton he came and I guess the bus we're leaving for somewhere and play Annie wasn't clean it so I would let him go you can't get on the bus he had to go home and get cleaned up then get to the airport if again so I went I was just extra for that I believed in that I believe in time very important I believe you should be on time and I found the practices for example we start on time we close on time youngsters didn't have to feel that you're going to keep them over when I speak and coaching clinics I often Tell Young coaches in the kitchen cleaning a young you know I probably newly married and I tell him don't run practices late because you'll go home in a bad mood and then that's not good for a young married man to go home in bed when you get ahold of me when you get older. Make a difference with Texas. so I did believe on time I believe starting on time and I believe closing on time and another one I had was not one word of her friends they one word of her family and you you out of here for the day if I see it in the game here, come out and sit on the bench and the third one was so I never criticized a teammate I didn't want that I used tell him I was paid to do that that's my job I'm paid to do a pitifully poor but I am paid to do not like the coaches today for gracious sakes know it's a little different than that was in my day but there was just three things that I am stuck with pretty clothes they all the time on those actually came for my dad and that's what he trying to teach to me and my brothers at one time I came up with a pyramid that eventually that I'm not going to have the time to go on that about that method to help me I think become a better teacher and now this is something like this and I had blocks in the pyramid and the cornerstones being industriousness. he has been working hard and enjoying what you're doing coming up to the Apex according to my definition of success and right into the top faith and patience and I say to you and whatever you doing you must be patient you have to have patience to we want things to happen to us if we talked about her used to being impatient. Then they are they won't change everything they think I'll change the dressing we can unload let things go and we forget that there is no progress without changed so you must have patience the night believe that we must have faith I believe we must believe who they believe it's not just give it weird service believe that things will work out as they should providing we do what we should I think our tendency is to hope that things will turn out the way we want them to go to the time but we don't do the things that are necessary to make those things become reality 14 years and I think it helped me become a better.. tripping at all involved around that the original definition of success you know a number of years ago there was a major league baseball umpire for the name of George Moriarty and he smelled more money with only one that's that's why I never seen that before but he did and big league baseball players that they're they're very perceptive about those things and they noticed he had only one eye in his name and you would be surprised how many also told him that that was one more thing I need head and a very nice time this week. honey wrote something that I think he did when I tried to do in this pyramid he called it the road ahead of the road behind and he said sometimes I think the fates must Grant as we denounce them and insist the only reason we can't win is the face themselves of Miss Glenn we win or lose within ourselves the shiny trophies on ourselves can never win tomorrow's game you and I know deep down there's always a chance to win the crown. When we feel to give our best we simply haven't met the test I'm giving all and saving none until the game is really one of showing what is meant by Grant playing through another's quit I'm playing through not letting up its bearing down that wins the cap no do you mean there's a go ahead and hoping when our dreams are dead I'm praying when her hopes up for the fall if bravery we have given all four who can ask more of a man than giving all within his fan give me all it seems to me is not so far from victory until the face or sell them wrong no matter how they Twisted wind it's you. who make our face we open up for close the gates on the road ahead and have the road behind reminds me of another set of three is that my dad tried to get across to us no wine don't complain don't make excuses you get out there and whatever you do and do it the best of your ability to no one can do more than that I trying to get across to the hotel you never heard me mention winning never mention winning my idea is that you can lose when you out score somebody in a game and you can win when you're outscored I felt that way on certain occasions various times and I went I just wanted to be able to be able to hold their head up after the game I guess you say that when when the game is over and you see somebody they didn't know the outcome I hope they couldn't tell by your actions whether you want to go to the point of view I pulled it out to Gordon's you if you make your effort. do the best you can regularly the results will be about what they should be not necessarily what you would want them to be but they don't be about what they should have been only you will know what you can do that and that's what I wanted from them more than anything else and as time went by and I learn more about other things I think it worked a little better as far as the results but I wanted in the score of a game to me the byproduct of these other things in there not the end itself and I believe it was him. one great philosopher said that no I know it is Cervantes Cervantes said the journey is better than the end and and and I like that I think that is because he is getting there sometimes when you get there that's almost have that down mrs. getting there that's the fun I like to the basketball coach at UCLA I liked our practices to be the journey and the game wouldn't think would be the end the end result and I'd like to have a sit in the stands and then watch the players playing to see whether I done a decent job during the week there again to get that stuff satisfaction knowing that they made the effort to do the best of which they are capable. sometimes I'm asked you who was Sim the best player I had over the best teams I can never answer that as far as the individual that concerned I I like to ask one time about that is supposed to say we could go to make the perfect player what would you want me to get an education there was a good student really knew why he was there in the first place but I want one that can play to I don't want to realize that the defense usually wins championships in to work hard on defense but I don't know how I'd want one to play offense to that I want him to be unselfish and when look for the past first and I'll shoot all the time and I don't under could pass and SunPass I had something I've had some of that couldn't wouldn't deny that something that wouldn't could you sure couldn't tell you yes. I have no one to be able to be good inside to be able to go out that they have the qualifications and then not the only one but he was one that I used in that particular category because I think he he made the effort to become the best of a couple I mentioned in my book they call me coach share that two players that gave me great satisfaction to came as closest I think anyone I ever had to reach their full potential one was kind of birth and when was Doug McIntosh when I saw them as freshmen on our freshman team we didn't have the price of a good play feisty when I thought and I know who Graces if these two players either one I'm there different years but I thought about each one of the time Hears a Who who she ever makes it Bark At The Varsity High Varsity must be pretty miserable if he's good to make a good enough to make it and you know one of them was in a starting player for season. half and the other ones have his next year he played in the 32 minutes and national championship game did a tremendous before us and the next year he was the starting a starting player on National Championship team and here I thought you'd never play a minute when he was so those are the things that I had to give you a great joy and great satisfaction to see want neither one of those youngsters could shoot very well but they had the outstanding shooting percentage is because he didn't didn't force it and neither one could jump right well I'm about to take a good position and so they didn't remember that every child has taken the assumed it'd be missed. Got two men to stand around and wait to see if it's missed then they're going to like somebody else is in there ahead of him and that they weren't ready quick but they kept him good balance and so they ain't they pretty pretty good defense for a so they had qualities that they came close to as close to reaching possibly their full potential as. players I ever had so I consider them is to be as successful as a as a Lewis Alcindor or a Bill Walton in many of the others that we had there was some outstanding of outstanding at players. I shave I rambled enough I always heard that when he makes his appearance that supposed to shut up",0.77734375
MatthieuRicard_2004,the state of in a state where there's nothing but loving kindness  to  the training we do that with objects we think of people suffering we think of people we love but at some point it can be a state which  already been shown the bell curve shows a lot of french intellectuals that think happiness is not at all interesting hundred and fifty controls  and what is being looked at is the difference between the right and the left frontal lobe in very short people who have more activity in the right side of the prefrontal they don't describe a lot of positive  the opposite on  more tendency to to express and curiosity and so forth so there's a basic line for people and also it can be you see a comic movie you go off to the left side if you are happy about something you'll go more to the left side if you have a bout of depression you'll go to the right side  the zero point five is the full standard who meditated on compassion it's something that is totally out of so i've no time to go into all the different scientific results hopefully they  come but they found that this is after three and a half hours in a fmri it's like on happiness and there was a controversy and someone wrote an article saying don't impose on us the dirty work also it has been shown in other labs for instance paul ekman 's labs in berkeley that some meditators are able also to control their emotional response more than it could be guy on a chair with all this kind of apparatus measuring your physiology and there's kind of a bomb that goes off it's so instinctive response that in twenty years they never saw anyone who  some meditators without trying to stop it open thinking that that bang is just going to be just a small  so the whole point of that not sort of to make thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump or whatever it's more to say that mind training matters that this is not just a luxury this is not a supplementary vitamin for the soul something that's going to we are ready to spend fifteen years achieving education we love to do jogging fitness we do all kinds of things to remain beautiful yet we spend surprisingly little of what matters most  we don't care about being happy we need to live with passion we like the ups and downs of life we like our suffering because it's so good when it ceases for we try to do in different places just this one example is worth a lot of work this lady with bone tb left alone in a tent going to die with her only daughter one year later how she is and just i leave you with the beauty of those  and jumping monks of tibet this is what i see from the balcony of my i guess it is a result of globalization that you can find coca cola tins on top of everest and buddhist monk in monterey it's about two meters by three and you are all welcome any time now let 's come to it seems that no one wakes up in the morning thinking may i  which means that somehow  directly or indirectly in the short or the long term somehow is related to a deep profound desire for as pascal said even the one who hangs himself somehow is looking for cessation of but then if you look in the literature east and west you can find incredible diversity only believed in remembering the past imagining the future never the present some people say happiness is right now it's the quality of the freshness of the present moment  and that led to that would be fine if it was just a secondary preoccupation in life but now if it is something that is going to we better know what it is have some that we don't know that is why so often although we seek happiness it seems we turn our back to it although we want to avoid suffering and so i just came two days ago from the one of the most common ones is  happiness and pleasure but if you look at the characteristics of those two  chocolate cake first serving is delicious second one not so much then we of things we get tired i used to be a fan of bach i used to play it on the i can hear it two three five times if i had to hear it twenty four hours non stop very tiring  if you are feeling very cold you come near a fire it's so wonderful  then after some moments you just go a little back and then  uses itself and also again it can also it's something that it is not something that is radiating outside like you can feel intense pleasure and some others around you can be suffering what then will be happiness and happiness of course is such so let 's say well being and so i think the best definition according to the not and all the joys and sorrows that can come one 's way you that might be and to show the place where in a way why not you hit the solid rock when you are surfing on the top you are all elated so you go from elation to depression there's no now if you look at the high sea of the ocean is me who began with being a molecular biologist in pasteur institute and found their way to the to have everything to be happy that very sentence already reveals the doom of destruction of happiness to have everything if we miss something it collapses and also when things go wrong we try to fix the outside so much look at inner conditions we know by experience that we can be what we call in little paradise and yet be completely unhappy within was once in portugal and there was a lot of construction going on everywhere so one evening he said look you are doing all these things but nice also to build something within and he said unless that even you get high tech flat on the one hundredth floor of a super modern if you are deeply unhappy within all you are going to look for is a window from which to so these are a few images i was lucky to so now at the  it's wonderful to live longer  to have access to information education to be able to travel to have freedom  take and be there so then when we ask oneself how to nurture the condition for happiness those which will undermine so then this needs to have some experience we have to know from ourself there are certain state of mind that are conducive to this flourishing this well being what the  there are some which are adverse  well being and so if we look from our own experience in eastern tibet wonderful  anger hatred strong grasping they don't leave us in such a good state after we have experienced it and also they are detrimental to others happiness so we may consider  that the more those are invading our mind and at the opposite everyone knows deep within  that an act of selfless generosity if from the distance without anyone knowing anything about it we could save a child 's life  this is from marlboro country such a sense of to change our way of being to transform one 's mind  those  is change possible in our emotions in our traits in our moods for that we have to ask what is nature and if we look from the experiential point of there is a primary quality of consciousness that's just the mere fact to be is like a mirror that allows all images to rise you can have ugly faces beautiful faces in the mirror the mirror allows that the mirror is not tainted is not modified is not altered by those images the bare consciousness pure awareness tainted intrinsically  hatred or jealousy because then if it was always there like a dye that would permeate the then it would be found all the time somewhere we know we're not always angry always jealous always so because the basic fabric of consciousness is this pure cognitive quality that differentiates it from a there is a possibility for change because all emotions are fleeting that is the ground for mind training mind training is based on the want to harm and want to do good you cannot in the same gesture shake this is the hottest day of the year somewhere in eastern tibet on august one st and the night before so there are natural antidotes so that's the way to proceed a kind of sense of inner freedom  opposite to intense grasping and obsession  kindness against hatred but of course each emotion then would need a particular antidote another way is to try to find a general antidote to all emotions and that's by looking at the very nature usually when we feel annoyed hatred with someone or obsessed with something the mind goes again and again to that object each time it goes to the object it reinforces that obsession or that so what we need to look now is instead of looking outward we  itself it looks very menacing like a billowing monsoon cloud we camped and my tibetan friends said we are going to sleep outside  we think we could sit on the cloud but if you go there  likewise if you look at the thought of if you do this again and again so this is the principal of mind training  because we time for all those faults in our mind the tendencies to  so it will take time to unfold them as well way to go mind transformation that is the meaning it means familiarization with a new way of being new way of perceiving things which is more an adequation with reality with interdependence with the stream and continuous transformation which our being and our consciousness why we have enough space in the the last twenty years thought to be more or less fixed when we reached adult age now recently it has been found that it can change a lot we heard who has done ten thousand hours of violin practice some area that controls the movements of fingers in the brain change a lot increasing reinforcement of the synaptic connections so can we do that with human qualities with loving kindness with patience with openness so that's what those great meditators have been doing  they do like three years retreat where they do meditate twelve hours a day and then the rest of their life they will do that three or four hours a day they are real olympic champions of mind training so now we are going to speak of happiness as a frenchman i must say that  this is the place where the  and fifty six electrodes so what did they find  the scientific embargo has been to submitted to nature hopefully it will be accepted ,"so I guess it is a result of globalization that you can find Coca-Cola tins on top of Everest and Buddhist monk in Monterey. and so I just came two days ago from the Himalayas to your kind invitation so I would like to invite you also for y to the Himalayas themself. Adam to show the place where meditators. let me begin with there being a molecular biologist Pastor Institute and found their way to the mountains. so just a few images I was lucky to to take has and be there. is the mount kailash in eastern Tibet wonderful. setting this is for Marlboro Country. tripitaka is Lake. this is the hottest day of the year somewhere in Houston to vet on August 1st at the night before. we can't find my dividend friends they were going to sleep outside and I see why we have enough space Independence. so now we are going to speak of Happiness as a Frenchman I must say that the lot of French intellectuals that seems that happiness is not at all interesting. I just wrote an essay on happiness and there was a controversy and then someone wrote an article saying don't impose on us the Dirty Work of Happiness we don't care about the happy we need to live with passion relax to Atkins Downes of Life who lack of suffering because it's so good when it sits for a while. this is what I see from the balcony of my Heritage and in the Himalayas it's about by 3 and you're welcome anytime. so let's come to happiness a welding. I'm so sorry for all the friends until April to say it seems like no one wakes up in the morning thinking may I saw for the whole day. which means that somehow consciously or not directly or indirectly in the short and long-term whatever we do whatever we hope whatever we dream. how is related to deep fry found desire for welding or happiness is looking for secession two of us a free fans no other way. but then you should look in the literature East and West you can find incredible diversity of definition of Happiness some people said only believed in the past you mentioning the Future Never End the present some people say happiness is right now is a quality of the freshness of the present moment. and that led to Arab X on the face videos of how to say happiness in the vague so that they could be on their own terms. one that would be fine if it was just a second we took your patient in life. but not if it is something that's going to determine the quality of every instant of our life and we both don't know what it is that's a i d. and probably the fact that we don't know that is why I so often do do we seek happiness with seems we turned our back to it or do we want to avoid suffering and since we're running someone to watch. and of course I'll come from some kind of confusion happiness and pleasure but if you look at the characteristic is contingent upon upon its object. upon the place. it is something that. changes of nature. beautiful chocolate cake is delicious second one not so much. that's the nature of things we get tired. are used to be a fan of used to play on the guitar and I can hear it to 35 times if I had to hear it 24 hours nonstop anybody call you can be a fire is so wonderful then after someone lies you just calling back and then stopped running. it's sort of uses itself as you experience it. I know so I can I get it it's going to say something that you it is not something that is radiating outside like you can feel intense pleasure and some others around you can be suffering a lot. no.. What can we be Happiness and happiness opposing such a big world. I'm sweating the best definition according to the police view is that why it's not just a pleasurable sensation. it is a deep sense of Serenity and fulfillment. estate. that's actually. Bambi's and underlies all emotional states that can come one's way. why that might be surprising can we have this kind of welding welding said anyway why not because. if look at the waves coming out the show. when you're at the bottom of the wave using the bottom. you ain't Solid Rock when you are suffering on the top of your old deleted so you go from a relation to depression there's no depth. nice look at the beautiful storms. but the depth of the ocean is still there. so how is that you can only be a state of being not just a fleeting emotion sensation even joy that can be the spring of happiness but there's also we can join rejoicing someone suffering. so how do we proceed in our quest for happiness. very often we look outside with all the condition something that we said everything to be happy to have everything to be happy that's very sent this already we have to do more of destruction of Happiness to have everything if we miss something it collapses. I don't know when things go wrong with 2016 outside so much but I'll control on the outer world is limited temporary and often. can I look at the inner conditions stronger is me the mind that translates the other condition into happiness and suffering We Know by experience that we can be and what do we call a little paradise and yet be completely unhappy with. the Dalai Lama was Swanson Portugal and there was a lot of construction going on everywhere so one evening he said look unless that even you get a high-tech flat on the 100th Floor office super modern and comfortable building if you're deeply unhappy with all you're going to look for is a window from which to jump. so now the opposite we know a lot of people with very difficult circumstances managed to keep Serenity in a freedom confidence. conditions are stronger of course the other condition do inference and it's wonderful to live longer and healthier Drive access to information education Liberty Travel truck freedom. highly desirable however this is not enough oxygen to help conditions. the experience that translate everything is within the mind so then when we ask how to nurture the countries for happiness and which of those would be undermined. but then it's definitely have some experience we have to know for myself that certain State of Mind as using to this flourishing to his well-being what the Greek word ammonia. Adele song which address to this wedding. and so if we look for my own experience. anger hatred and jealousy arrogance. I'm grasping they don't leave us in such a mood state after we have experienced it I also their happiness. so we may consider that the more of those are invading our mind and like a chain reaction the more we feel miserable I meant at the opposite everyone knows deep within his generosity is from the distance we don't know anyone knowing anything about it with someone happy we don't need the recognition we don't need any crises you just have me a fact of doing that. she's such a sense of a depression without deep nature and we would like to be like that all the time. so is it possible to change a way of being to pass someone's mind. all those negative emotion of destructive emotion inherent to the nature of mind. he's a chance possible in our emotions in our moods. but that's you have to ask what's nature of mind if we look from the experience of point of view. be aware I was just doesn't like a mirror at the Law School images to why isn't it ugly faces beautiful faces the mirror the mirror that it's not painted is not modify is not by those images and wellness this is the nature of It kind of be painted intensity with hatred plot Danny's. We found all the time so we know when they always angry always jealous always generous. so because the basic fabric of Consciousness is this through committee for Quality that differentiated from a stone online training has been on the ID opposite manufactures at the same time same time for the same object the same person want to harm in one to the good you can see the same gesture check hand and give a blow. so that I'm not some antidote to emotion at a destructive tour in your well-being. so that's a way to proceed rejoicing compared to jealousy as opposition to fracking and obsession. benevolence. loving kindness against hatred. another way is to trying to find a general antidote to all emotions. and that's kind of nature. usually when we feel annoyed pictures all except with someone or obsessed with something the mine was again and I know that that annoyance so there is a process. you can enjoy itself it looks very menacing like a bellowing Munson Cloud thunderstorm but we think we could sit on the plow but you could go there like why they should look at the thought of anger it will vanish like Frost and The Morning Sun if we do this again it would be less and less each time we were distorted. so this is the principal of my training. no. next time because we picked up time for all those Fortune of Mind a tendency to build up my information that is the meaning of meditation thing which is moving at equation with reality with interdependence with the train and continues transformation without being at a concert that is. so the interface with cognitive style since we need to come to that and what was the subject of we have to do it in such a short time with brain plasticity brain was thought to be fixed all the normal Connection in numbers and quantities in the last 20 years. To be more or less fixed when we reach the adult age about Ronnie says we heard you have been $10,000 of 5 and fifty some area that controls the movement of fingers in the brain. so can we do that with human qualities with loving-kindness with patients with openness. so that's what those great military leaders have been doing. some of them came to the last like in Madison Wisconsin of in Berkeley this 20 to 40,000 hours of meditation Retreats for the humidity 12 hours a day and then the rest of your life they would do that 34 hours a day they are real Olympic champions of mine training.that is the place where they make these kind of inspiring with 256 electrons. so why did I find a purse. something scientific embargo hopefully it will be accepted the state of compassion unconditional compassion we need the address where I've been doing that for years and years and years to put their mind and instead what is nothing but loving kindness have ability to sense in being with objects we think of people suffering with the people we love that at some point you can be a state which all-pervading. he has a preliminary results. cuz I got to show you this already been shown the bell curve shows 150 consoles and that is the difference between the right and the left frontal lobe in very short people with more activity on the right side of the prefrontal cortex I'm more depressed withdrawn they don't describe him lot of positive effect. it's opposite on the left side more than this to all praises to happiness to expire and curiosity and so far so it can be if you see if you go to the right side. the - 15 is a full standard deviation of a meditator to Millie's on compassion. so I don't have to go into all the different scientific results hopefully they will come but they found that this after three and a half hours in the fmri. also it has been showing me the other labs for instance for like months lives in in in Berkeley it's more than it could be taught at the stop an experiment if you sit on the chair with all this kind of effort is measuring your physiology and is it supposed to anyone who who win the job. summer somebody theaters without trying to stop it but simply by being completely open thinking that he's just going to be just a small Evans that the shooting stars for the V point of that is not sort of to make that is a thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump or whatever it's called to set up my training modules that this is not just a luxury this is not a supplementary vitamin for the soul this is something that's going to. determine the quality of every in Singapore life we're ready to spend 50 years at education we love to do jogging Fitness to do all kinds of things to prevent beautiful. yet we spend surprisingly little time taking care of what matters most the way our mind functions which again is the ultimate things that determines the quality of experience to be putting action in different places just this one example is where it's a lot of where this lady with Von TV left alone in the tent is going to die with the only daughter one year later how she is. different schools and Clinics windowing in Tibet. address I leave you with the beauty of those clocks that tells more about happiness that I could ever say. flying Maps. thank you very much",0.6432291269302368
WillardWigan_2009G, the she thought i was at school and i used to do a u turn when her back was turned and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden now the one time i was in the shed and so  the my mother suspected something thinking i was at school my mother was like the woman in tom and jerry so you'd just see so i was hiding in the shed like that and  and then i saw her legs and then she said grabbed me like that because my mother was quite big and she lifted me  something doesn't mean it's not there my work is it's a reflection of myself what i wanted to do is to  school i told her i couldn't face it because the way the teacher was treating me ridiculing me and using me as an example of at that age obviously i couldn't express it that way but i told her i didn't feel right and then she said you 're going back to school tomorrow and walked off and i didn't expect  that because i expected one of these but i didn't get it so i'm sitting there thinking  and as i looked down on the ground i noticed there was some ants running around and i went into this little fantasy world and i thought  looking for the queen ant or do they need somewhere to live so i thought perhaps if i made these ants some apartments so i did and how i set about that i got some splinters of wood and i sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass constructed this little apartment well it little shanty shed when i'd finished but i thought perhaps the ant won 't know it'll probably move in and so  a bit crude at the time and i made all these little apartments and little merry go rounds seesaws and swings little ladders and i encouraged the ants to come round by putting sugar and things like that and then i sat down and all the ants came along and all i could hear was  this i realized that to life than just everything that we see around us that's show the world that the little things can be the biggest things i says  and then he said but i don't believe that you can do we all seem to think that you know if we look down on the ground there's nothing there and we use the word nothing of glass which as you can see that's the actual frame of i i don't inhale my of glass and i had to  nothing doesn't exist because there is always something my mother told me that when i was a child  my that i should always respect the little things what made me do this work i shall go into my story and when i finished it i and things  to carve homer simpson like that in that position and  to make sure that there is room for bart's neck so after i've done the same thing then i have to this all started when i was age five paint brush but i would never do it to a living fly because i've heard a fly i would never  because and what made me do it at school i will admit this academically i couldn't express myself so i was to six to seven weeks more or less classed as nothing my world was seen as less  the whole thing it's made the  of a  i and i cut it bent it round and and the spider 's web is for the reins on the so i decided i didn't really want to be a part of that world i thought i need to retreat into something else so when my mother used to take me to school  a machine that one took me ,there's an old saying just because you can't see something doesn't mean it's not there. my work is its collection of of myself and what I want you to do is to. show the world that the little things can be the biggest things. we will seem to think that you know if we will look down on the ground there's nothing there I will use the word nothing. nothing doesn't exist because I've always something my mother told me that in when I was a child that I should always respect the little things. what made me do this work how long she'll go into my my story. pause a little story book into it this all started when I was 85. and what made me do it but school will admit this academically I couldn't express myself so I was molested class there's nothing my world was seen as less. so when I decided I didn't really want to be a part of that world so I thought I need to retreat into something else so I went to school. she thought I was at school and I used to do a U-turn when the back was turned and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden. no I'm the one time I was in the shed and. my mother suspected something thinking I was at school and my mother was right the woman in Tom and Jerry so so you just see if 8. so I was out doing in the shed. and then. I saw her legs and then she said. grabbing all that to my mother's quite big and she Lifted Me Up and she says. add to another school and I told her I couldn't face it because the way I said the teacher was treated me ready killing me and using me as an example of Celia so I thought I told her but at that age I couldn't really express it that way but I told her I didn't feel right at 10 and then she just got to school tomorrow because I expected one of these. but I didn't get it so I'm sitting there thinking. I didn't look down on the ground. I noticed there was some ants running around. and I went into this little fantasy world and I thought. these are. are they looking for the queen ant or did I need somewhere to live. so I thought perhaps if I make these and some apartments. they'll move in. so I did. and how about such a bad that I got from Spain to the wood and a slice easier to explain to the wood with a broken Shard of glass constructed this little apartment. look like a little Shanty shed when I'm see sores and swings at the ladders by putting sugar and things like that and then I sat down and all the ants. and all I could hear was. how much does yes that will fit you. and that they moved in and decided not to pay me any rent. I'll get to the series and from there that I was watching this world and a part of me. when I discovered that I had this gift. I wanted to experiment with this world that we can't see because I'm so very intelligent. so I I realize that there is more to life than just everything that we see around us that's that's huge so I started to educate myself on the molecular level. and as I as I got older continue.. And I will show you something here. explain. as you can see. that's a pinhead. no that is called a half as the gentleman who commissioned me to do this. honey Sesame we. Can you put my house on the Pinhead. so I said how are you going to fit in there. and then he said to me. I don't believe you can do it can you really do as well. try me and then he said I don't believe that you can do this. okay so cut long story short I went home went to leave the microscope and I crushed up a piece of glass across the top and underneath the microscope that would explain to them glass some of them were quite jagged. so I was crushing up these piece of glass which is you can say that is the actual that's the actual frame of the house and. the actual roof is made up of five that we shall find in life sisters old teddy bear. so I got the teddy bear and I'll send you mind if I pull that money your father's so I did and I looked it up and it was decided to slice these up with the two that I make fire ice sharpen the end of the dealings with blade and then I I actually slow down the whole nervous system and then I would betray my heart beat and I have one and a half seconds to actually move. and at the same time I have to watch I don't inhale my own work at the same time. because that has happened to me. so why don't you like us to come back to the Glass Family little bits of glass and I have to make them Square so I'm thinking how can I do this so what I did I got to oil Stone broke the edge of an oilstone off and what I did I took pieces of glass and I started to rub them I used a little to ease at which I made from an accurate and built a rubber around the end of the trees are so I wouldn't touch the glass and then I started rubbing very very gently. tell some of the edges with quite square and they're not constructed in how I constructed It Is by making grooves in the top of the Pinhead and then pushing the glass in with its own friction and I was doing it what happened they said that the instrument that I use turn into a catapult and it went like this. and then. how is it. gum. so I'm thinking mr. off isn't going to be very happy when I told him his eyes he's gone to another. so cut the story short I decided that I had to go back and do it off and some more not decided to construct it very very slowly holding my breath working between my heartbeat and making sure everything is level at the physick because it's such a small sculpture yet nothing can go wrong and decided to build it up then I used $5 out of my jumper which I held and stretched and made the beams going around the house and the actual windows and the balcony at the be so the construction I use money spider's web to be attached to it and things would send me insane but I managed to do it and when I finish date I came back the next day and I was at the house is occupied. have you ever heard of a dust mite. diamond dust mite and his family moved in. so basically I got completed the house and that you are.right I didn't say you bought Simpsons having a little argument. I think they're arguing about the space on the PIN. there's not enough room for the two of them so I didn't think he was going to throw but I think you just wanting and actually but I'm this one was made out of out of my shirt. what I do. If I unplug the tiger and and put it under the microscope how use the needle which is going to slide blade on the end can I get that needle. so what a date is the same process where I'll just kind of owe my breath and just walk away very very slowly manipulation the plastic companies because it'd be a different one of your work on that level things be a different cuz it's on the molecular level things change and they act different and sometimes that turn it into a catapult and things go up in heaven you know the old different things happen but I'll have to make a little barrier go in there and he's has a cellophane to stop the stop it moving then static electricity setting tournament and I'm trying to remove in the static interfering with everything so you know the sweat dripping off my head because I have to have almost seems like that in that position and I had to shave then I have to make sure that there's room for thoughts neck. so after I've done the same thing then I have to paint it after I've actually sculpted them I have to paint them I experimented with a dead fly in a flock the head of the Flies head to start to make a paint brush.but I would never do it to a living fly. because. I've had to fly in pain and I got. email to get another job would never kill it and insects because you know all creatures great and small do you know that there's a hymn that says that so clock. fine hair out of my face. and I looked at in the microscope that was a paintbrush and we have to be very careful because the pain starts to turn into little blobs and it starts to dry very quickly so I have to be very quick if I'm not a land of looking not like what it's supposed to look like it could end up looking like a Dumpty. or somebody else so I have to be very very careful so this one took me approximately I would say 6 to 7 weeks my work rough estimate sometimes 5 6 to 7 weeks econo's anticipate it's very painstaking work but the best things come in small packages. as you can say that's Charlton Heston go down to size. he says to me will I guess you can see him sane. why me I would say probably measures. Stop by if you come to the. Stop it. That's about the size of it but the whole thing it's made the cherries made of gold and Charlton Heston is made of a floating by the we talked to Kat via when the sunlight comes through the window you say visit the farthest than what I normally do is walk around the room. trying to find one. had an opportunity to microscope I'm in the one time I was doing it in the window was open and there's a lady standing about the bus stop and she saw me walk in the rain.. Then she looked at me and then I went. okay he's not mad little flake of gold in and then I'll cook it been two grand and made into the Chariot and the horses made from the island and the spider's web is for the 8th for the range on the horse to get the symmetrical shapes of the horse was very difficult because it had so I have to get the horse to rear up and look as though it was totaled in some kind of action there's no way you can do this you must have used some kind of machine there's no way a man can do that it must be a machine so I said okay then. that one took me proximately 6 weeks. the most famous statue in the world. this one I would say was it that serious challenge. because. cuz I have to put a torch on the top. that one is more or less the same type of process the bottom of it is called from a grain of sand. because I wanted to get a bit of a stone effect I used it a microscopic shot of diamond to isakov the actual base I can look at the Statue was or wasn't it so the captain image in my head of you know that the beginning of people coming to America so it's sort of Ellis Island and and see in America for the first time and then not to put a signature so I wanted to have that little a magician and this is it.and we all know that is the Hulk I want you to create movement in the 11:00 needed because as we know we see needles but feeling not familiar with the eye of a needle than putting the fence of it so I broke the needle and. may the needle look like a hoax broken it it's some. I have to make little holes in in in the base of needle should be 15 so emotional work if I don't use glue that going with their own friction and that's that's how I managed to do it so it was as soon as you can say he's looking at the moment she's got little bring me some his face is not as much they probably about three microns so the eyes are probably bad. but ship. that's made from 24 carat gold and I normally drink it with the web of the money spider but at the Wreck-It with strands of glue because the web of the spider they was sending me and saying that I couldn't get the web to move off and that's 24 karat gold in its construct construct a t h plank of gold and the whole thing is sort of a symmetrical the flag activities made out of little strands of gold you know it was like an operation to get this thing right. as you can say dressage. it's something I wanted to do just to show how about could get the symmetrical shape they actual rigging on the reins on the horse night from the same sort of thing that was done with a particles from my shirt and the Pina. Made Greenery on their bike scraping the particles off a green shirt and then pressed onto the needle,0.76953125
PeterDonnelly_2005G, now that's a logical error it's exactly the same logical error as the logical error of thinking that after the disease test which is ninety nine percent accurate the chance of having the disease is ninety nine percent in the disease example we had to bear in mind two things one of which was the possibility that the test got it right so here 's what you do when they say to you what do you do you say i 'm a statistician there are two things involved two parts to the explanation we want to know how likely or relatively how likely two different explanations one of them is that sally clark was innocent which is a priori overwhelmingly likely most mothers don't kill their children the other explanation is that she was guilty now we probably think a priori that's unlikely and we certainly should think in the context of a criminal trial that that's unlikely because of the presumption of innocence and then if she were trying to kill the children she succeeded so the chance that she's innocent isn't one in seventy three million we don't know what it is it has to do with weighing up the strength of the other evidence against her and the statistical evidence we know the children died what matters is how likely or unlikely relative to each other the two explanations are and they're both implausible there's a situation where errors in statistics had really profound and really unfortunate consequences in fact there are two other women who were convicted on the basis of the evidence of this pediatrician who have subsequently been released on appeal now and they'll know you're making it up and then one of two things will happen they'll either discover their long lost cousin in the other corner of the room and run over and talk to them so just to conclude what are the take home messages from this well we know that randomness and uncertainty and chance are very much a part of our everyday life in not getting the examples i gave right it's very well documented that people get things wrong they make errors of logic in reasoning with uncertainty in medicine and indeed quite a lot of industry all of quality control which has had a major impact on industrial processing is underpinned by statistics so if a pediatrician had come out and said to a jury i know how to build bridges i've built one down the road please drive your car home over it they would have said well pediatricians don't know how to build bridges that's what engineers do if you believe the number just like the seventy three million to one that's not what it meant and there have been celebrated appeal cases in britain and elsewhere because of that and just to finish in the context of the legal system it's all very well to say let 's do our best to present the evidence but more and more in cases of dna profiling this is another one we expect juries in the case of uncertainty we get it wrong all the time and at the very least we should be aware of that and ideally we might try and do something about it thanks very much it's one of the challenges in our profession to try and explain what we do we're not top on people 's lists for dinner party  guests and conversations and so on and it's something i've never really found a good way of doing but my wife who was then my girlfriend managed it much better than  been able to many years ago when we first started going out she was working for the bbc in britain and i was at that stage working in america i was coming back to visit her she told this to one of her colleagues  said well what does your boyfriend do sarah thought quite hard about the things i'd explained and she concentrated in those days on listening  that and she was thinking about the work i did developing mathematical models for understanding evolution and modern genetics so when her colleague said what does he do she paused and said he models things to tell you about the mysteries of the universe or the wonders of evolution or the really clever innovative ways people are attacking the major inequalities in our world how we react to that and how well we do or don't think about it so you've had a pretty easy time up till now a few laughs and all that kind of thing in the talks think and i'm going to ask you some questions so here 's the scene for the first question i'm going to ask you can you imagine tossing a coin successively and for some reason which shall remain rather vague we're interested in a particular pattern here 's one a head followed by a tail followed by a tail so suppose we toss a coin repeatedly then the pattern head tail tail that we've suddenly become fixated with happens here and you can count one two three four five six seven eight nine ten it happens after the tenth toss this side to think about the other half of the audience doesn't like head tail tail they think for deep cultural reasons that's boring on this side you've got a number you've done it lots of times so you get it accurately which is the average number of tosses until head tail tail on this side you've got a number the average number of tosses until head tail head or even the challenges of nation states in the modern global economy my brief as you've just heard is to tell you about statistics so what's going on here so you've all got to think about this and you've all got to vote and we're not moving on and i don't want to end up in the two minute silence to give you more time to think about it until everyone 's expressed a view  ok so what you want to do is compare the average number of tosses until we first see head tail head with the average number of tosses until we first see head tail tail who thinks that a is true that on average it'll take longer to see head tail head than head tail tail who thinks that b is true that on average they're the same  that c is true that on average it'll take less time to see head tail head than head tail tail ok who hasn't voted yet because that's really naughty i said you had to  ok so most people think b is true and you might be relieved to know even rather distinguished mathematicians think that it's not a is true here it takes longer on average in fact the average number of tosses till head tail head is ten and the average number of tosses until head tail tail is eight how could that be anything different about the two and to be more precise to tell you some exciting things about statistics and that's that's rather more challenging than all the speakers before me and all the ones coming after me there is head tail head overlaps itself if you went head tail head tail head you can cunningly get two occurrences of the pattern in only five tosses you can't do that with head tail tail that turns out to be important there are two ways of thinking about this i'll give you one of them so imagine let 's suppose we're doing it on this side remember you're excited about if it comes down a head that's great you're done and you celebrate if it's a tail well rather disappointedly you put the glasses away and put the champagne back and you keep tossing to wait for the next head to get excited on this side there's a different experience it's the same for the first two parts of the sequence you're a little bit excited with the first head you get rather more excited with the next tail then you toss the coin if it's a tail you crack open the champagne if it's a head you're disappointed but you're still a third of the way to your pattern again and that's an informal way of presenting it that's why there's a difference my senior colleagues told me when i was a youngster in this profession rather proudly that statisticians were people who liked figures but didn't have the personality skills to become accountants little chemical scissors called restriction enzymes which cut dna whenever they see particular patterns and they're an enormously useful tool in modern molecular biology and instead of asking the question how long until i see a head tail head you can ask how big will the chunks be when i use a restriction enzyme which cuts whenever it sees g a a g for example how long will but it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern experimental technologies a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated to know that i do something useful in my day job rather more sophisticated than the head tail head story but quite sophisticated computer modelings and mathematical modelings and modern statistical techniques  give you two little snippets two examples of projects we're involved in in my group in oxford both of which i think are rather exciting you know about the human genome project that was a project which aimed to read one copy of the human genome the natural thing to do after you've done that and that's what this project the international hapmap project which is a collaboration between labs in five or six different countries  why do we care about that well there are lots of reasons the most pressing one is that we want to understand how some differences make some people susceptible to one disease type two diabetes for example  and other differences make people more susceptible to heart disease or stroke or autism and so on one big project there's a second big project recently funded by the wellcome trust in this country involving very large studies thousands of individuals with each of eight different diseases common diseases  like type one and type two diabetes and coronary heart disease bipolar disease and so on to try and understand the genetics to try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the diseases and there's another in joke among statisticians and that 's how do you tell the introverted statistician from the extroverted statistician to which the answer is the extroverted statistician 's the one who looks at the other person 's shoes why do we want to do that because we understand very little about most human diseases we don't know what causes them and if we can get in at the bottom and understand the genetics as i said the little diversion on my main love back to some of the more mundane issues of thinking about uncertainty here 's another quiz for you now suppose we've got a test for a disease which isn't infallible but it's pretty good it gets it right ninety nine percent of the time and i take one of you or i take someone off the street and i test them for the disease in question let 's suppose there's a test for hiv the virus that causes aids and the test says the person has the disease the test gets it right ninety nine percent of the time so a natural answer is so let 's think about a disease that affects it's pretty rare it affects one person in ten thousand amongst these million individuals most of them are healthy and some of them will have the disease and in fact if this is the prevalence of the disease about one hundred will have the disease and the rest won 't so now suppose we test them all what happens well amongst the one hundred who do have the disease the test will get it right ninety nine percent of the time and ninety nine will test positive put that another way of all of them who test positive so here they are the individuals involved less than one in one hundred  actually have the disease so even though we think the test is accurate the important part of the story is there's another bit of information we need here 's the key intuition what we have to do once we know the test is positive is to weigh up the plausibility or the likelihood of two competing explanations each of those explanations has a likely bit and an unlikely bit one explanation is that the person doesn't have the disease that's overwhelmingly likely if you pick someone  but i want to tell you something useful and here it is so concentrate now this evening there's a reception in the university 's museum of natural history and it's a wonderful setting as i hope you'll find and a great icon to the best of the victorian tradition  but the test gets it wrong which is unlikely the other explanation is that the person does have the disease that's unlikely but the test gets it right which is likely and the number we end up with that number which is a little bit less than one in one hundred is to do with how likely one of those explanations is relative to the other each of them taken together is unlikely a more topical example of exactly the same thing those of you in britain will know about what's become rather a celebrated case of a who had two babies who died suddenly and initially it was thought that they died of what's known informally as cot death and more formally as sudden infant death syndrome for various reasons she was later charged with murder and at the trial her trial a very distinguished pediatrician gave evidence that the chance of two cot deaths long story short she was convicted at the time later and fairly recently acquitted on appeal in fact on the second appeal and just to set it in context you can imagine how awful it is for someone to have lost one child if they're innocent to be convicted of murdering them to be put through the stress of the trial convicted of murdering them and to spend time in a women 's prison where all the other prisoners think you killed your children is a really awful thing to happen to someone it happened in large part here because the expert got the statistics horribly wrong in two different ways so where did he get the one in seventy three million number he looked at some research which said the chance of one cot death in a family like sally clark 's is about one in eight and a half thousand  so if you toss a coin twice the chance of getting a head twice are a half that's the chance the first time times a half the chance a second time so he said here let 's assume i'll assume that these events are independent when you multiply eight and a half thousand together twice you get about seventy three million and none of this was stated to the court as an assumption or presented to the jury that way it's very unlikely in this special setting and this collection of people but you might just find yourself talking to someone you'd rather wish that you and secondly it's palpably false there are lots and lots of things that we don't know about sudden infant deaths it might well be that there are environmental factors that we're not aware of and it's pretty likely to be the case that there are genetic factors we're not aware of so if a family suffer from one cot death  put them in a high risk group they've probably got these environmental risk factors and or genetic risk factors we don't know about and to argue then that the chance of a second death is as if you didn't know that information is really silly the first problem the second problem is what does the number of one in seventy three million mean so after sally clark was convicted you can imagine it made rather a splash in the press one of the journalists from one of britain 's more reputable newspapers wrote that what the expert had said was the chance that she was innocent was one in seventy three million ,"as long as we couldn't have said it's a rather daunting experience and if they don't have experience to be speaking in front of this audience but I'm like the other speakers I'm not going to tell you about the mysteries of the universe all the wonders of Eeveelution all the way they have our innovative ways people to try checking the major inequalities in that world or even the challenges of of nation states in the global economy and three or four sides to tell you some exciting things about statistics. someone in one of my senior colleagues told me when I was a Youngster in this profession I tried the proudly the statisticians with people who like figures but didn't have the personality skills to become a counselor. and there's another injector Monk statisticians and that's how do you tell the introvert in statistician from the extroverted statistician. 2 what's the answer is the extra virgin statisticians the one who looks at the other person's shoes. but I want to tell you something useful I'm here it is it's like something's right now that this evening at the reception in the University's Museum of Natural History and it's a wonderful setting as I hope you'll find an icon to the rest of the Victorian tradition you might say it's very unlikely in this special setting a collection of people but you might just find yourself talking to someone you'd rather I wish that you were the news what you do when they say to you what you do you say I'm a statistician. and wake up at 1 now and I love you all right you will make it up and then one of them hungry and I'll send both ends with off for a drink and some food and you'll be left in peace to talk to the person you want to talk to. it's one of the challenges in that profession to try and explain what we do when don't tell other people's lists for dinner party guests then combinations and sell them and it's something I've never really found a good way of doing but my wife who is that my girlfriend mine isn't much better than I've ever been able to many years ago when we first started going out she was working for the BBC in Britain and I was at upstage washing in America her colleagues who said well what is your boyfriend do. they're thought quite hard about the things I'd explained in the end she concentrated in those days on listening and. and she was good tell her I said that and she was thinking about the work I did developing mathematical models for understanding Evolution and Mountain genetics what does he do she paused and said he models things. well the culling something I got much more interested than I had any right to expect and went on and said what does T-Mobile and said jeans. t-models jeans. that is my first love and that's what I'll tell you a little bit about what I want to do more generally is is to get you thinking about the place of uncertainty and Randomness and child soon I will do and how we react to that and how well we do or don't think about it so you had a pretty easy time up till now if you lost and all that kind of thing in the talk today you've got to think and I got to ask you some questions to ask you for some reason which shall remain so suppose we toss a coin repeatedly then the patent head Telltale that we suddenly become fixated with happens here and you can count 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 happens after the 10th Tulsa. they might have gotten more just do things to do but humor me for the moment of the audience about coins and I tossed them until I finished a department head tile tile for the second time maybe stop the full toss next time I flew 1:45. Lots and lots of times in the average those numbers. that's what I want this side to think about the other half of the audience doesn't like head-to-toe deep cultural reasons that's boring and then get it from Paton head-to-head got your coins and you tell us until some toast and you count the number of times until a patent head to head up his I knew everything. okay so I'll decide you want a number are you got lots of time so you got it accurately which is the average number of times does until head tile tile on this side that you brought a number the average number of houses until head-to-head. play The Deep mathematical fact if you got two numbers one of three things must be true either they the same or this one's bigger than this one or this one's bigger than that one. so what's going on here so you won't think about this and you will go to vote and we're not moving on and I don't want to end up in the two-minute silence to give you more time to think about it and tell everyone to express the view okay so what you want to do is compare the average number of Tulsa until we first see head-to-head with the average number Tulsa until we first see head Telltale. who thinks at 8 is true that on average it'll take longer to see head-to-head then head to Alto. he thinks it's B is true then I'll never stay the same. do you think that Siri is true that I have original take less time to see head-to-head then head to hotel. I got you invited yet cuz that's really naughty I said you had to. okay so most people think B is true and you might be relieved to know even rather distinguished mathematicians think that it's not. hey is true here. it takes longer on average about the average number of sources told head-to-head is 10 and a number Thompson to head tile tile. how could that be. anything different about the two patents. there is head tile tile at a head-to-head overlaps itself if you went head to head to head you can come get to occurrences a patent in 95. you can't do that with head tail tail. that turns out to be important the two ways of thinking about this I'll give you one of them so I imagine let's start tossing a coin and we get ahead then and you stop sitting on the edge of your seat because something great and wonderful awesome might be about to happen next is a time when I was just next to you about the glasses chilled to celebrate your waiting with bated breath for the finals house and if it comes down ahead that's great you're dumb and you celebrate if it's a child support until you put the glasses away and put the champagne back and you keep tossing to wait for the next head to get excited. on this side is a different experience it's a time for the first two pots of the sequins a little bit excited with the first head you get the more excited with the next tile then you toss the coin if it's a tale that you crack open the champagne. if it's a head you're disappointed but you'll still a third of the way to go Pat McGann and that that's an informal way of presenting it that's why there's a difference now the way I think about it if we toss the coin 8 million times and would expect a million head to head to Saint emilion head tail Tails cut the head tile heads could occur in clumps. the run for a million things that are not - 8 million positions and I can have some of them overlapping. W the Clans will be further apart the intuition what's the point I want to make it a very very simple example and easily sated question in probability which everybody everybody gets wrong direction into my real passion which is genetics there's a connection between head tile heads and head tile tiles in genetics and it's the following sequence of heads and tails when you look at DNA does a sequence of milk to things heads and tails with full that is a g season tees. little chemical scissors called restriction enzymes which cut DNA whenever they see particular patents and they are an enormously useful tool in molecular biology. instead of asking the question how long until I see a head-to-head you can ask how big will a chunks be when I use a restriction enzyme which Cuts whenever it sees giag for example how long will it comes to be. that's about the Robert trivial connection between probability and genetics is much deeper connection which I don't have time to go into and that is that exciting later in the conference specifically about that but it turns out that I'm looking the secrets in the information generated by Morgan experimental Technologies keep positive that has to do with you be relieved to know that I do something useful to my day job rather more sophisticated than the head-to-head story but quite sophisticated computer modeling is a mathematical modeling techniques and I'll give you two little Snippets two examples of projects we're involved in in my group in Oxford both of which I think is rather exciting you know about the Human Genome Project which a.m. to read one copy of the human genome. the natural thing to do after you've done that and that's what this project is National habitat project which is a collaboration between labs in five or six different countries. think of the Human Genome Project is learning what we've got in common and that project is trying to understand where there are differences between different people. why do we care about that while there are lots of reasons the most pressing one is that we want to understand how some differences make some people susceptible to one disease type two diabetes for example and all the differences make people more susceptible to heart disease or stroke or Autism and so on. it's one big project is the second big project recently funded by the wellcome trust in this country involving very large studies thousands of individuals with each of eight different diseases, diseases like type 1 and type 2 diabetes and Kearney heart disease bipolar disease and sell them to try and understand that genetics to try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the disease has why do we want to do that about most human diseases we don't know what causes them and if we can get in at the bottom and I would have a window on the way the disease works at a whole new way about thinking about disease therapies and preventive treatment. text Anna said the little diversion on my main love backpack to some of the more mundane issues are thinking about uncertainty for you. now suppose we go to a test for disease which isn't infallible but it's pretty good to get it right 99% of the time. and I take one of you or take someone off the street and I test them for the disease in question that supposes a test for HIV the virus that causes AIDS and the test says the person has the disease. what's the chance of a do. tickets it right 99% of the time so a natural answer is not going to say. come on I want to get involved I think you don't trust me anymore. well you're right to be a bit skeptical because that's not the answer I thought you might think it's not the answer and it's not because it's only part of the story that she depends on how, know how rare the disease is right that he is a little caricature of a million individuals. set a timer to take about a disease that affects it's pretty rare to fix one person in ten thousand a month he's been an individual's most of them healthy and some of them will have the disease and in fact if this is the prevalence of the disease about a hundred will have the disease and the rest went so now suppose we test the mole what happens at 99 will test positive. these are the people who don't have the disease the test will get it right 99% of the time they let me get it wrong 1% of the time but there's so many of them that they'll be enormous number of false positives. put that another way of all of them who tests positive so he that the individuals involved less than 1 and 100 actually have the disease. but even though we think the test is accurate the important part of the story is there's another bit of information we need. here's the key intuition. what we have to do once we know the test is positive is to weigh out the plausibility or the likelihood of two competing explanations. each of those explanations has a likely bit unlikely but one explanation is that the person doesn't have the disease that's overwhelmingly likely to pick someone at random. bought the test gets it wrong which is unlikely. the other explanation is that the person does have the disease that's unlikely but the test gets it right which is likely. and the number we went and up with a number which is a little bit less than 1 and 100 is to do with How likely one of those explanations is relative to the other. each of them taken together is unlikely. Isabel topical example of exactly the same thing those of you in Britain will know about what's become rather or celebrated case of a wound. He clock who had two babies who died suddenly and eventually it was told that I died of what's known informally is called death and my family is having infant death syndrome. the various reasons she was later charged with murder and at the trial trial of our distinguished pediatrician gave evidence that the chance of two Cup dates innocent deaths in the family like hers which was professional non-smoking was 1 + 73 million. cut a long story short she was convicted at the time later said he recently acquitted on appeal in fact on the second appeal for someone to have lost one child and then two if they're innocent to be convicted of murdering up to people through the stress of the trial convicted of murdering them and to spend time in a women's prison what will the other person was saying you killed your children really awful thing to happen to someone. what is happening lajpat here because the expert. stop the statistics horribly wrong. in two different ways so why did he get the one in 73 million number. he looked at some research which said the child should one cut that's in a family like Sally Clark's is about one in eight and a half thousand. so you said I was shooting the if you have one cup that's in a family the chance of a second child dying from caught death on changed. that's what's a decision to pull an assumption of Independence it's like saying if you toss the coin and get ahead the first time that way to take the chance of getting ahead the second time so we just a coin twice the chance of getting a head twice our house that's job the first time such as time that he said that these events are independent 73 million. unfortunately here and ready regrettably Festival in a situation like this you have to do I fight it in periodically and secondly it's palpably false. there are lots and lots of things that we don't know about sudden infant deaths. it might well be that there are environmental factors that we not aware of and it's pretty likely to be the case of their genetic factors when underwear off. do the family suffer from one called if you put them in the high-risk group they probably got these environmental risk factors and all genetic respect as we don't know about and to argue then let the chance of a second death is as if you didn't know that information is really silly. what some silly it's really bad science. none of us that's how it was presented at a trial nobody even argued it. that's the first problem the second problem is what is the number one and 73 million mean. turn off the Telly clock was convicted you can imagine a major all the. a splash in the press one of the journalist from from Britain one of Britain's most reputable newspapers wrote that what the expert had said was the chance that she was innocent was 1 and 73 million. that's a logical era it's exactly the same logical era as a logical thinking that after the disease test which is 99% accurate the chance of having the disease at 99%. in the disease example we had to bear in mind to things one of which was a possibility that this has got it right or not and the other one was a child's a priori that the person had the disease or not exactly the same in this context. there are two things involved two Pops to the exclamation we want to know how likely or relatively High likely to different explanations are one of them is that he was innocent which is a priori overwhelmingly likely the most mothers don't kill her children. and the second part of the explanation is that she suffered an incredibly unlikely event known as I'm likely is 1 + 73 million but nonetheless rather unlikely that unlikely and we said we should think in the context of a criminal trial that that's unlikely because of the presumption of innocence. and then if you are trying to kill the children she succeeded. the chance that she's innocent isn't 1 and 73 million we don't know what it is it has to do with weighing up the strength of the other evidence against her and the statistical evidence. we know the children died what matters is How likely or unlikely relative to each other the two explanations off and they both implausible. living situation where are is in statistics had really profound and really unfortunate consequences released on appeal many cases were reviewed because he's currently facing a charge at Britain's General Medical Council what are the take-home messages from this week we know that Randomness and I'm certain the enchants a very much a part of our everyday life. it's also true and below that you was a collective a very special in many ways you're completely typical in not getting examples I gave right it's very well-documented let people get things wrong they make errors of logic and reasoning with uncertainty. we can cope with this awful does your language bring Italy never seen Eeveelution me questions about how we got here we are not good at raising with uncertainty. that's an issue in our everyday lives as you heard from any of the Tulips statistics on the pins enormous amount of research in science and social science in medicine and indeed quite a lot of industrial to quality control which had a major impact on Industrial processing is underpinned by statistics. it's something with bad at doing at the very least we should recognize that and we tend not to to go back to the the legal context at the trial has just accepted what the experts said the pediatrician had to come out and said to a jury I know how to build Bridges I built one down the road please drive your car home over it they would have said we'll pediatricians have an effect to be said or or implied I know how to reason with uncertainty I know how to do statistics and everyone said well that's fine he's an expert. 32 on the side where a competency is and isn't exactly the same kinds of issues arose in the early days of DNA profiling when scientists and lawyers and in some cases judges routinely misrepresented evidence. usually one hopes innocently but misrepresented evidence forensic scientists said the chance of this guy is innocent is one in three million that wasn't what even if you believe the number just like the 73 million to one that's not what it meant I never been celebrated appeal cases in Britain and elsewhere because of that. and just to finish in the in the context of the legal system it's all very well to say let's do our best to prevent the evidence but more and more in cases of DNA profiling this is another one we expect juries who only people and it's documented a very bad at this we expect Erie is to be able to cope with assaultive of reasoning that goes on in life and people out of Duty logically we say that's not a good thing we saw the receptor the politicians and the time at the very least we should be aware of that and ideally we might try and do something about it thanks very much",0.7083333730697632
JohnLloyd_2009G,the late geoffrey dickens m p was attending a fete in his constituency wherever he went at every stall he stopped he was closely followed by a devoted smiling woman of indescribable ugliness so he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in and on the photograph he wrote with a flourish to horse face with love from geoffrey dickens m p sent off his secretary said to him did you get that letter from the woman at the fete i wrote horse face on her so you'd remember he thought he wished he was invisible  so one of the interesting things about invisibility is that things that we can't see we also can't understand gravity is one thing that we can't see and which we don't understand it's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces and the weakest and nobody really knows what it is or why it's there for what it's worth sir issac newton the greatest scientist who ever lived he thought jesus came  question is what is invisible i see all your faces i have no idea what any of you are thinking isn't that amazing isn't that incredible that we can't read each other 's minds but we can touch each other  taste each other perhaps if we get close enough but we can't read each other 's minds i find that quite astonishing in the sufi faith this great middle eastern religion which some claim is the route of all religions sufi masters are all telepaths more of it than you think actually everything i would say everything that matters except every thing and except matter so they say but their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist so that's why we don't think it exists the sufi masters working on us  the laws of physics invisible eternal omnipresent all powerful remind you of anyone interesting i 'm as you can guess not a materialist i'm an immaterialist and i've found a very useful new  ignostic okay i'm an ignostic i refuse to be drawn on the question of whether god exists until somebody properly defines the terms another thing we can't see is the human genome and this is increasingly peculiar because about twenty years ago when they started delving into the genome they thought it would probably contain around one hundred thousand genes geneticists will know this but every year since it's been revised downwards we now think there are likely to be only just over twenty thousand genes in the human genome this is extraordinary because rice get this rice is known to have thirty eight thousand genes you know that two more than people and the same a gorilla  you can't see these things but they are very strange we can see matter but we can't see what's the matter as in this cryptic sentence i found in the guardian recently the stars by day i always think that's fascinating the universe disappears the more light there is the less you can see time  isn't that extraordinary you can not remember what happened to you earlier than the age of two or three which is great news for psychoanalysts because otherwise they'd be out of a job because that's where all the stuff happens that makes you who you are another thing you can't see is the grid on which we hang this is fascinating you probably know some of you that cells are continually renewed you can see it in skin and this kind of stuff livers and internal organs sort of take a bit longer a spine takes several years but at the end of seven years not one cell in your body remains from what was there seven years ago the question is who then are we what are we what is this thing that we hang on that is actually said to be the most successful ever invention of a word by a known individual quite good he also invented a word called blass meaning astral radiation didn't is so many things that see that don't let anyone tell you they understand electricity they don 't nobody knows what it is you probably think the electrons in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire don't you at the speed of light when you turn the light on they don 't electrons bumble down the wire about the speed of spreading honey they say hundred billion of them estimated in the universe one hundred billion how many can we see  there's a world of invisibility there  and that's what they do radio that's what they discovered anyway so the biggest thing  about anything and i've come to the conclusion so we can see the stars and the planets but we can't see what holds them apart or what draws them together  you can't see a point it 's by definition dimensionless like an electron oddly enough but the point what i've got it down to is there are only two questions really worth asking why are we and what should we do about it while we are and to help you i've got two things to leave you with from two great philosophers perhaps two of the greatest philosopher thinkers of the twentieth century one a mathematician and an engineer and the other a poet the who said i don't know why we are here but i'm pretty sure it's not in order to enjoy ourselves  secondly and lastly w h auden one of my favorite poets who said we are here on earth to help the others are here for i've no idea with matter as with people we see only the skin of things we can't see into the engine room we can't see what makes people tick at least not without difficulty the closer we look at anything the more it disappears in fact if you look really closely at stuff if you look at the basic substructure of there isn't anything there electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz and there is only energy and you can't see energy  so everything that matters  slightly silly thing that's invisible is this story which is invisible to you and i'm now going to make it visible to you in your minds it's about an m p called geoffrey dickens ,"so question is what is invisible there's more of it than you think actually everything I would say everything that matches accept everything. and except matter. we can see Masa but we come see what's the matter as in this cryptic sentence I found in the guardian recently. the marriage suffered a setback in 1965 when the husband was killed by the wife. there's a world of invisibility there isn't.. So we can see the stars and the planets but we can't see what holds them apart or what draws them together with Massa has with people we see any the skin of things we can't see into the engine room accounts see what makes people take at least not without difficulty on the closer we look at anything the more it disappears in fact you look really closely and stuff you look at the basic substructure of Masa there isn't anything that electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz and there is any energy you count C energy. so everything that matters it's important is invisible one slightly silly thing that's invisible is this story is invisible to you and I'm not going to make it visible to you and your minds. it's about an empirical Jeffrey Dickens. but like Jeffrey Dickinson pee was attending a face in his constituency where every Wednesday every still he stopped he was closely followed by devoted smiling woman of indescribable ugliness try as he might he couldn't get away from him a few days later I received a letter from a constituent saying how much she admired him I'd met him in the face and asking for a signed photograph off to her name written in Brackets with the app's description whole Space. I've misjudged this woman thought mr. Dickens is she aware of a physical repulsiveness she turns it to our advantage is not enough so he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph and on the photograph he wrote with a flourish to horse face with love from Jeffrey Dickens and pay off your being sent off his sex research when did you get that letter from the woman at the fight I ride horse face on how do you remember who she was.I bet he thought he wished he was invisible then you. so one of the interesting things about invisibility is the things that we can't see we also come to understand gravity is one thing that we come see on which we don't understand is the least understood the full the full for the fundamental forces and the weakest I love you really knows what it is or what's that what it's worth Sir Isaac Newton the greatest scientist who ever lived he thought Jesus came to Earth specifically to operate the leave of the gravity that's what he thought he was at 4 so bright guy could be wrong on that one I don't know. Consciousness I see all your faces I've no idea what any of your thinking is not amazing is it incredible that we can't read each other's mind but we can touch each other taste each other perhaps if we get close enough but we count read each other's minds I find that quite astonishing in a Sufi Faith great some Middle Eastern religion which some claim is the root of all religions Sufi monsters are all telepaths so they say but then main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals the rest of us that it doesn't exist. so that's why we didn't think it was a Sufi Mobsters working on this. in the question of Consciousness and artificial intelligence artificial intelligence really like the study of Consciousness don't know where we have no idea how Consciousness works with us with intelligence cannot trace it on facial intelligence they haven't yet crazy. Fishel stupidity. the laws of physics invisible Eternal omnipresent or powerful remind you of anyone. interesting I'm as you can guess not a materialist I'm an inventory list and I find it very useful new word agnostic okay I'm an agnostic I refuse to be drawn on the question of whether God exists until somebody properly defines the Thames. I don't think we come see is the human genome and this is increasingly peculiar because about 20 years ago and they thought it would only contain around 100,000 genes Genesis will know this but every year since has been revised downwards we not think they're like to be any just over twenty thousand genes in the human genome this is extraordinary because rice get this rice is known to have 38,000 jeans. potatoes potatoes have 48 chromosomes to more than people on the same as a gorilla. you don't see these things but they are very strange. the Stars by day I was think that's fascinating the universe disappears The more light there is the less you can see. time maybe you can see time as if you know this month is this is a big movement in motion physics to decide the time doesn't really exist because it's too inconvenient for the figures is much easier if it's not really that you can't see the future obviously you can't see the past except in your memory what are the interesting things about the pasta is you particularly come see my son asked me this the other day said that can you read what I was like when I was too and I said yes he said why can't I it's not extraordinary you cannot remember what happened to you earlier than the age of 2 or 3 which is great news for psychoanalyst because otherwise I'd be out of a job because that's where all the stuff happens. that makes you who you are. another thing you come see us the Grid on which we hang this is fascinating you probably know some of you that sells A continuing you didn't see it and scan them this kind of stuff skin flakes off has grown out of that kind of stuff but every cell in your body is replaced at some point taste buds every ten days or so livers and then turn Logan to take a bit longer spine take several years but at the end of seven years not one cell in your body remains from what was the seven years ago the question is who then are we what are we what is this thing that we hang on that is actually awesome. okay atoms come see them nobody ever will last more than the wavelength of light gas company that interesting somebody mention 1600 recently gas was invented in 1600 by a chemical Van Helmont and it said to be the most successful ever invention of a word by unknown individual quite quite good he was invented the blast ask for radiation didn't catch on but well done him this is so many things that some light you come see light when it's done in the vacuum if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes he went said Sunday technical some physicists will disagree with this but it's all that you can't see the beam of light you can only see what it hits my friend Alex tornado field sealight Northfield see Darkness electricity come see that don't let anyone tell you they understand electricity they don't nobody knows what it is. you probably think the electrons in the electric when I move in sometime this week. It was odd that you at the speed of light when you turn the lights on they don't electrons Bumble down the wire about the about the speed of spreading honey they say. galaxies hundred billion of them estimate in the universe hundred billion how many can we see 55 out of 100 billion galaxies with the 99 one of them is quite difficult to see that she got very good eyesight. radio waves there's nothing Honey Cuts when he discovered radio waves Nation 87b cool them right away it's cuz they radiated and somebody said 200. One of these radio waves that you found me said well I've no idea but I guess somebody will find a use for them Sunday. and that's what they do right here that's what they discovered the biggest thing that's invisible to us is what we don't know it is incredible how little we know Thomas Edison once said we don't know 1% of 1 million about anything and I come to the conclusion. because you also saw the question what's another thing we count see the point most of us what's the point. you can't see a point it's by definition dimensionless like an electron only enough but the point where I put it down to his there any two questions really worth asking why we here and what do we do about it while we are. and to help you I've got two things to leave you with from to Great philosophers props to the greatest philosopher thinkers of the 20th century want a mathematician and engineer or the other pirate the first is Ludwig Wittgenstein. who said I don't know why we are here but I'm pretty sure it's not in order to enjoy ourselves. it was a channel.

SugataMitra_2010G,one billion children we need one hundred million mediators there are many more than that on the planet ten millions soles one hundred and eighty billion dollars and ten years we could change everything thanks  children will learn to do what they want to learn to do this is the first experiment that we did eight year old boy on your right teaching his student a six year old girl and he was teaching her how to browse this boy here in the middle of  village where the children recorded their own music and then played it back to each other and in the process they've enjoyed themselves thoroughly they did all of this in four hours after seeing the computer for the first time in another south indian village these boys here had assembled a video camera and were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee they downloaded it from disney com or one of these websites fourteen days after putting the computer learn to use computers and the internet on their own irrespective of who or where they were at that point i became a little more ambitious and decided to see what else could children do with a computer we started off with an experiment in hyderabad india kind of an obvious statement up there i started with that sentence about twelve years ago i gave a group of children they spoke english with a very strong telugu accent i gave them a computer with a speech to text interface which you now get free with windows and asked them to speak into it so when they spoke into it the computer typed out gibberish so they said well it doesn't understand anything of what we are saying so i said yeah i'll leave it here for two months make yourself understood to the computer so the children said how do we do that and i said i don't know actually  and i two months later and this is now documented in the information technology for international development journal that accents had changed i started in the context of developing countries but you're sitting here from every corner of the world so if you think of a map of your country  so they could do that on their own after that i started to experiment with various other things that they might learn to do on their own i got an interesting phone call once from columbo from the late arthur c clarke who said i want to see what's going on and he couldn't travel so i went over there he said two interesting things a teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be the second thing he said was that if children have interest then education happens and i was doing that in the field so every time i would watch it and i took the experiment to south africa this is a fifteen year old boy i and i asked him do you send emails and he said yes and they hop across the ocean in cambodia rural cambodia a fairly silly arithmetic  would play inside the classroom or at home they would you know throw it back at you they'd say this is very boring if you leave it on the pavement the adults and all over india at the end of about two years children were beginning to google their homework as a result the teachers reported i think you'll realize that for every country on earth you could draw little circles to say these are places where  tremendous improvements in their english rapid improvement and all sorts of things they said they have become really deep thinkers and so on and so forth and indeed they had i mean if there's stuff on google why would you need to stuff so at the end of the next four years i decided that groups of children can navigate the internet to achieve educational objectives on their own at that time a large amount of money had come into newcastle university  to improve schooling in india so newcastle gave me a call i said i 'll do it from delhi they said there 's no way you're going to handle a million pounds worth of university money sitting in delhi so in two thousand and six i bought myself a heavy overcoat and moved to i wanted to test the limits of the system the first experiment i did out of newcastle was actually done in india and i set myself and impossible can tamil speaking twelve year old children in a south indian village teach themselves biotechnology in english on their own and i thought i'll test them they'll get a zero i'll give the materials i'll come back and test them they get another zero i'll go back and say yes we need teachers for certain things i  in twenty six children they all came in there and i told them that there's some really difficult stuff on this computer i wouldn't be surprised if you didn't understand anything it's all in english and i'm going  on top of that those are the places from where trouble comes so we have an ironic problem good teachers don't want to go to just those places where they're needed the most  them with it i came back after two months and the twenty six children marched in looking very very quiet i said did you look at any of the stuff they said yes we did did you understand anything no nothing so i said well how long did you practice on it before you decided you understood nothing they said we look at it every day so i said for two months you were looking at stuff you didn't understand so a twelve year old girl raises her hand and says apart from the fact that improper replication of the dna molecule causes genetic disease we've understood nothing which was not very nice well one of the girls had taught herself to become the teacher and then that's her over there english the last bit when i asked where is the neuron and she says the neuron the neuron and then she looked and did this whatever the expression so their scores had gone up from zero to thirty percent which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances  but thirty percent is not a pass so i found that they had a friend a local accountant a young girl and they played football with i asked that girl would you teach them enough biotechnology to pass and she said how would i do that i don't know the subject i said no use the method of the grandmother she said what 's that i said well what you've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time say to them that 's cool that's fantastic what is that can you do that again can you show me some more she did that for two months the scores went up to fifty which is what the posh schools of new delhi with a trained there was something happening here that definitely was getting very serious so all sorts of remote places i came to the most remote place that i could think of five thousand miles from delhi is the little town of gateshead in gateshead i took thirty two children and i started to fine tune the method i made them into groups of four i said you make your own groups of four each group of four can use one computer and not four computers remember from the hole in the wall you can exchange groups you can walk across to another group if you don't like your group etc you can go to another group peer over their shoulders see what they're doing i basically embedded a computer into a wall of the children enthusiastically got after me and said now what do you want us to do i gave them six gcse questions the first group the best one solved everything in twenty minutes the worst in forty five they used everything that they knew news groups google wikipedia ask jeeves etc the teachers said is this deep learning i said well let 's try it i'll come back after two months we'll give them a paper test no computers no talking to each other etc the average score when i'd done it with the computers and the groups was seventy six percent when i did the experiment when i did the after two months the score was seventy six percent there was photographic  recall inside the children i suspect because they're discussing with each other a single child in front of a single computer will not do that in new delhi the children barely went to school they didn't know any english they'd never seen a computer before i have further results which are almost unbelievable of scores which go up with time because their teachers say that after the session is over the children continue to google further in britain i put out a call for british grandmothers after my kuppam experiment well you know they're very vigorous people british grandmothers two hundred of them volunteered  the deal was that they would give me one hour of broadband time sitting in their homes  one day in a week so they did that and over the last two years over six hundred hours of instruction has happened over skype using what my students call the granny cloud  you and they didn't know what the internet was i connected high speed internet to it it's about three feet off the ground turned it on and left it there after this we noticed a couple of interesting things which back at gateshead a ten year old girl gets into the heart of hinduism in fifteen minutes you know stuff which i don't know anything about two children watch a tedtalk they wanted to be footballers before after watching eight tedtalks he wants to become it's pretty simple stuff this is what i'm building now they're called soles self organized learning environments the furniture is designed so that children can sit in front of big powerful screens big broadband connections  but in groups if they want they can call the granny cloud this is a sole in newcastle the mediator is from india so how far can we go one last little bit and i'll stop i went to turin in may i sent all the teachers away from my group of ten year old students i speak only english they speak so we had no way to communicate i started writing english questions on the blackboard the children looked at it and said what i said well do it next question where is calcutta this one i tried a really hard one then who was pythagoras and what did he do was silence for a while then they said you 've spelled it wrong it's  but i repeated this all over india and then through a large part of the world and noticed that the so you know what's happened i think we've just stumbled across a self organizing system a self organizing system is one where a structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside self organizing systems also always show emergence which is that the system starts to do things which it was never designed for which is why you react the way you do because it looks impossible i think i can make a guess now education is self organizing system where learning is an emergent phenomenon it'll take a few years to prove it experimentally but i'm going to try but in the meanwhile there is a method available ,"well that's kind of an obvious statement of the I started with that sentence about 12 years ago and I started in the context of developing countries but you're sitting here from every corner of the world so if you think of a map of your country I think you realize that up for every country on Earth you could draw little circles to say these are places where the teachers won't go. on top of that those are the places from the Trouble Comes so we have an ironic problem where they needed the most I started in 1999 to try and address this problem with an experiment which is a simple experiment in New Delhi basically embedded a computer into a wall of a slam in New Delhi and they didn't know what the internet was connected high-speed internet to it it's about three feet off the ground turned it on and left it there. after this we noticed a couple of interesting things which you see but I repeated this all over India and then to a large part of the world and what is that children will learn to do what they want to learn to do this is the first experiment that we did on your right the six year old girl. and he was teaching her how to browse. this boy here in the middle of central India. this is Anna. I just turned village where the children recorded their own music and then played it back to each other and in the process they enjoyed themselves apparently they did all of this in 4 hours after seeing the computer for the first time. in another South Indian village. these boys here at assembly the video camera and we're trying to take a photograph of a bumblebee that downloaded it from Disney., one of these websites 14 days after putting the computer in that Village. so at the end of it we can to date that groups of children can learn to use computers and the internet on their own irrespective of who or where they were. at that point it became a little more ambitious and decided to see what else could you do with a computer experiment in Hyderabad India but I give a group of children they spoke English with a strong Telugu accent I gave them a computer with the speech-to-text interface with you now get free with Windows and ask him to speak into it when they spoke into it the computer typed out gibberish so this is understood to the computer. so the children said how do we do that and I said I don't know and I and I left. two months later and this is not documented in the information technology for International Development Journal that accents a changed and we're remarkably close to the neutral British accent in which I train the speech-to-text full-size in other words they were all speaking like James 2D. so you can do that on their own they might learn to do on their own phone call Vincent Palumbo from the late Arthur C Clarke's who said I want to see what's going on and he couldn't travel so I went over there he said two interesting things should be. the second thing you said was that if children have interest than education happens. and I was doing that in the field so everytime I would watch it and think of him finding which interests them and windy but interest that you might have education games like science animals. and I am I listen to music and I also do send emails and he said yes and they hop across the ocean. this isn't Cambodia Cambodia. a very silly arithmetic game back at you and all the adults go away with each other about what they can do which is what these children are doing with the x x. and all over India at the end of about two years children were beginning to Google their homework as a result of the teachers reported tremendous improvements in their English. and indeed they had. I mean if if there's stuff on Google why would you need to stuff it into your head. so at the end of the next four years I decided the groups of children can navigate the internet to achieve educational objectives on their own at that time to improve schooling in India so Newcastle give me a call I said I'll do it from Delhi they said there's no way you're going to handle the million pounds worth of University money sitting in Delhi so in 2006 I bought myself a heavy overcoat and move to new gossip I wanted to test the limits of the system the first experiment ideas out of Newcastle was actually done in India and I set myself and impossible Target. 10 tamil-speaking 12 year old children in a South Indian village teach themselves biotechnology in English on their own. and I thought I'd estimate they'll get 20 I'll give them I'll come back and test them they'll get another 0 I'll go back and say yes we need teachers for certain things. I called in 26 children they all came in there and told them that there's some very difficult it's all in English and I'm going in looking very very quiet I said well did you look at any of the steps did you understand anything no nothing. so I said well how long did you practice on it before you decided that you understood nothing this is a hand and says. apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes genetic disease we've understood nothing else. took me three years to publish that has just been published in the British Journal of educational technology one of the referees who have read the paper said it's too good to be true. which was not very nice and then that's her over there. remember they don't study English. I waited to the last people she said when asked where is the new run and chooses a new run the New London schools have gone up from 0 to 30% which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances and they played football with the technology and she said how would I do that I don't know the subject that I said well what you got to do is stand behind them and admired them all the time she did that for two months the scores went up to 50 which is what the bar schools of New Delhi with a trained by our technology teacher were getting. so I came back to Newcastle with these results and decided that there was something happening here that definitely was getting very serious. so having experimented in all sorts of remote places I came to the most remote place that I could think of. across the river Tyne 5000 miles from Delhi is little town of gates it and I made them into groups of four I thought you make your own groups of four each group of four can use one computer and not for computers remember from the hole in the wall. you can exchange groups you can walk across to another group if you don't like your group Etc you can go to another group to see what they doing come back to your own group and claim it as your own and I explained to them that a lot of scientific research is done using that method. the children and Susie Astic really got afternoon. What do you want us to do as I gave them six GCSE questions the first group the best one sold everything in 20 minutes in 4500 everything that the new newsgroups Google Wikipedia off gives Etc earning a comeback after 2 months will give them a paper test no computers no talking to each other at cetera the average score when I done it with the computers and the group's was 76% when I did the experiment when I did the test after 2 months the score was. 76%. there was a photographic recall inside the children I suspect because they're discussing with each other computer will not do that I have results which are almost unbelievable of scores which go up with time because the teacher said that after the session is over the children continue to Google further. getting bitten I put out a call for British grandmother's after my coupon experiment Centier immediately. the the deal was that they would give me one hour of broadband time sitting at their homes. one day in a week. so they did that and over the last two years over 600 hours of instruction has happened over Skype using what my students called The Granny cloud. radical outfits over there I can beam them to whichever school I want to. you can't touch me. Texas road map. power of the Supreme Court of Hinduism in 15 minutes you know stuff which I don't know anything about. do children watch a TED Talk they wanted to be footballers before after watching a TED Talks he wants to become Leonardo da Vinci.it's it's freezing. This is what I'm building now they call soles cell phone and I was learning environments the furniture is a big big Broadband connections but in groups if they want they can call the granny Cloud this is a soul in Newcastle the mediator is from Pune India so how far can we go a little bit early. I went to to rain in May. I sent all the teachers away from a group of 10 year old students I speak only English they speak only Italian. so we had no way to communicate I started writing English questions on the Blackboard. The Children looked at it and said what I said do it the type it into Google translated into Italian went back into Italian Google 15 minutes later. next question where is Calcutta. this one they took only 10 minutes. I tried to give you a hard one then. who was Pythagoras and what did he do. it was silent for a while. Linda said you spelled it wrong it's Pete Agora. and then. in 20 minutes the right angle triangles began to appear on the screen to Justin Shivers up my spine. these are 10 year olds. so you know what's happened I think we've just stumbled across a self-aggrandizing system organizing system is one where the structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside sidewalk and I think systems also always show emergence which is that the system starts to do things which it was never designed for which is why you react the way you do because it looks impossible I think I can make a guess no education is a self-organizing system with learning is an emergent phenomenon it'll take a few years to prove it but I'm going to try but in the meanwhile there is a method available. 1 billion children we need 100 million mediators there are many more than that on the planet 10 million Souls 180 billion dollars and ten years. we could change everything thanks.we are Intel sponsors of tomorrow",0.73046875
WoodyNorris_2004, put lenses in front of it focus it a little bit better ultimately we figured out how to make things  lasers that were totally focused now think about where the world would be today if we had the light bulb if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to you turn on the loudspeaker and after almost eighty years of having those gadgets the sound just kind of goes where it wants even when you're standing in front of a megaphone it's pretty much every direction a little bit of differential but not much if the light bulb was the way the speaker is and you couldn't focus or sharpen the edges or define it or movies in general or computers or tv sets or cds or dvds and just go down the list of what the importance is of being able to focus light  now after almost eighty years of having sound i thought it was about time that we figure out a way to put sound where you want to i have a couple of units that guy there was made for a demo i did yesterday early in the day for a big car maker in detroit who wants to put them in a car small version over your head so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car  what if i could aim sound the way i aim light i got this waterfall i recorded in my back yard now you're not going to hear a thing because i have some limited time i'll cut it off for a second and tell you about how it works and what it's good for sony 's got an idea sony 's our biggest customers right now they tried this back in the sixties and were too smart and so they gave up but they want to  and though i did not graduate from college doesn't mean i'm stupid because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today too many other smart people out there so was working at the university of washington and i came up with an idea from reading a magazine article for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm now that was before cassette tapes cds dvds any of the cool stuff we've got now i just happened to get my education in a little different way i'm not at all against education i think it's wonderful i think sometimes people when they get educated lose they get so smart they're unwilling to look at things that they know better than and we're living in a great time right now because almost everything 's being explored anew i have this little slogan that i use a lot which is virtually nothing and i mean this honestly has been invented yet we're just starting we're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics and this is i hope a little piece of it sony 's got this vision back to get myself on track that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket new tv channel they know that when you watch tv at home because there are so many choices you can change channels miss their commercials now they've tried this a couple years ago and it failed because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message every twenty minutes and reaches out turns off the sound and you know if the sound isn't there the sale typically isn't made for instance like when you're on an airplane they show the movie you get to watch it for free and so abc and sony have devised this new thing where when you step in the line in the supermarket initially it'll be safeways it is safeways they're trying this in three parts of the country right now  you'll be watching tv and hopefully they'll be sensitive that they don't want to offend you with just one more outlet but what's great about it from the tests that have been done is if you don't want to hear it you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it so we create silence as much as we create sound talk to you nobody else hears it sit in bed two in the morning watch tv your spouse or someone is next to you asleep doesn't hear it doesn't wake up we're also working on noise canceling things like snoring noise from automobiles and it was an arm that instead of i have been really lucky with this technology all of a sudden as it is ready the world is ready to accept it they have literally beat a path to our door we've been selling it since about last september october and it's been immensely gratifying if you're interested in what it costs i'm not selling them today but this unit with the electronics and everything if you buy one is around a thousand bucks we expect by this time next year it'll be hundreds a few hundred bucks to buy it it's not any more pricey than regular electronics now when i played it for you you didn't hear the thunderous bass and pivoting as it went across the record this unit that i played goes from about two hundred hertz to above the range of hearing it's actually emitting ultrasound low level ultrasound that's about one hundred thousand vibrations per second and the sound that you're hearing unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face is made out in front of it in the air the air is not linear as we've always been taught  went straight a radial linear tracking tone arm you turn up the volume just a little bit i'm talking about a little over eighty decibels and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate the speed of sound is not a constant it's fairly slow it changes with temperature and with barometric pressure now imagine if you will without getting too technical i'm making a little sine wave here in the air  well if i turn up the amplitude too much having an effect on the pressure which means during the making of that sine wave the speed at which it is propagating is shifting and it was the hardest invention i ever made all of audio as we know it is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear means higher quality sound  hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite  effect happens in the air it's a corrupting effect of the sound the ultrasound in this case but it got me started and but it's so predictable that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect now the question is where's the sound made instead of being made on the face of the cone it's made at literally billions of little independent points along this narrow column in the air i got really lucky after that and without giving you too much of a tirade i want to talk to you about an invention i brought with me today i said we can shorten the column put it so that one ear hears one speaker the other ear hears the other that's true binaural sound when you listen to stereo on your home system  your both ears hear both speakers turn on the left speaker sometime and notice you're hearing it also in your right ear so the stage is more restricted the sound stage that's supposed to spread out in front of you because the sound is made in the air along this column it does not follow the inverse square law which says it drops off  about two thirds every time you double the distance six db every time you go from one meter for instance to two meters that means you go to a rock concert or a symphony and the guy in the front row gets the same level as the guy in the back row now all of a sudden a separate system in the back i was seeing if you were listening a stereo system in the front for mom and dad and maybe there's a little dvd player in the back for the kids and the parents don't want to be bothered with that or their rap music or whatever so again this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on no that's not true either golly i'm just totally losing it my forty fourth patent it also works for transmitting and communicating data it also works five times better underwater got the military have just deployed some of these into iraq where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some biblical verse i'm and they have these infrared devices that can look at their countenance and see a fraction of a degree kelvin in temperature shift about the from one hundred yards away when they play this thing we make a version with this which puts out one hundred and fifty five decibels pain is one hundred and twenty so it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people and there can be a public beach just off to the side and they don't even know it's turned on we sell those to the military presently for about seventy thousand dollars and they're buying them as fast as we can make them we put it on a turret so that when they shoot at you you're over i have a bunch of other inventions i invented a plasma antenna to shift gears  looked up at the ceiling of my office one day i was working on a ground penetrating radar project and my physicist ceo came in and said we have a real problem we're using very short wavelengths to play it for you in a couple minutes but i want to make an analogy before i do to  got a problem with the antenna ringing i just sold that for a million and a half dollars cash i took it back to the pentagon after it got declassified when the patent issued and told the people back there about it and they laughed and then i took them back a demo and they bought any of you ever wore a jabber headphone the little cell headphones that's my invention i sold that for seven million dollars big mistake it just sold for eighty million dollars two years ago i actually drew that up on a little crummy mac computer in my attic at my house and one of the many designs which they have now is still the same design i drew way back when so i've been really lucky as an inventor i'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet i usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say that's really cool but what's it good for my dad died before he realized anybody in the family would maybe hopefully make something out of themselves you've been a great audience i know i've jumped all over the place i usually figure out what my talk is when i get up in front of a group let me give you in the last minute i've got a coke can opening that's right in your head that's really cool thank you once again and i say what is the light bulb good for sound light i'm going to draw the analogy  when edison invented the light bulb came out of it in every direction ,"I became an inventor by accident and I was out of the Air Force in 1956 then I came up with an idea from reading a magazine article for a new kind of a phonograph tonearm than I was before cassette tapes CDs DVDs any of the cool stuff we've got now and it was an arm that instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record went straight radio linear tracking tonearm and it was a hard decision I ever made but they got me started and I got really lucky after that without giving you too much of a tirade I want to talk to you about an invention I brought with me today my forty fourth invention no that's not true either, I'm just totally lose its my 44th patent about the 15th invention I called the s. Hypersonic sound in a couple of minutes but I want to make an analogy before I do to this I usually show this Hypersonic sound and people will say that's really cool but what's a good for. and I say what is the light bulb good for sounds like I'm going to drive the analogy of the light bulb pretty much look like this hasn't changed that much. like him out of it in every direction before the light bulb was invented people and figured out how to put a reflector behind it focus a little bit but lenses in front of it focused a little bit better ultimately we figured out how to make things like lasers that were totally focused not think about where the world would be today if we had the light bulb. but you couldn't focus like if when you turn one on it just went wherever it wanted to. that's the way loud speakers pretty much are you turn on a loudspeaker and after almost 18 years of having those gadgets. the sound just kind of goes where it once even when you're standing in front of a megaphone it's pretty much every direction little bit of differential but not much. if a light bulb was the way the speaker is and you couldn't focus or sharpen the edges or Define it we wouldn't have that. or movies in general or computers or TV sets. or CDs or DVDs I just go down the list of what the importance is of being able to focus light. now after almost 80 years of having sound. I thought it was about time we figure out a way to put sound where you want to. I have a couple units that guy there was made for a demo I did yesterday early in the day for a big car maker in Detroit who wants to put them in a car small version over your head so you can actually get binaural sound in a car. what if I could aim sound the way I am light. I got this waterfall I recorded in my backyard now you're not going to hear a thing. unless it hit you maybe if I hit the Sidewalk Ends around the room is being made right next to your ears. is that cool. because because I have some limited time I'll cut it off for a second and tell you about how it works and what it's good for. course like light it's great to be able to put sound to highlight a clothing rack or the corn flakes for the toothpaste or talking plaque in the movie theater Lobby Sony's got an idea he's our biggest customers right now they tried this back in the sixties and we're too smart so they gave up but they want to use it in the do I did not graduate from college doesn't mean I'm stupid because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today too many other smart people out there so I just have to get my education in a little different way I'm not at all against education think it's wonderful I think sometimes people when they get educated lose it they get so smart they are unwilling to look at things that they know better than. and we're living in a great time right now because almost everything is being explored a new. I have this with a slogan that I use a lot which is virtually nothing and I mean this honestly has been invented yet we're just starting we're just starting to really discover the laws of Nature and Science and physics and this is I hope a little piece of it so he's got this Vision back to get my stuff on track that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket you're going to watch a new TV channel they know that when you watch TV at home because there are so many choices you can change channels miss their commercials. 151 million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket. now they tried this a couple years ago and it failed because the checkered gets tired of hearing the same message every 20 minutes and reaches out turns off the sound and you know if the sound isn't there the sale typically isn't made for incidents like we're on an airplane that show the movie you get to watch it for free when you want to hear the sound you pay. and so ABC and Sony have devised this new thing where when you stuff a lot in the line in the supermarket initially will be safe ways it is Safeways are trying this in three parts of the country right now you'll be watching TV and hopefully they'll be sensitive that they don't want to offend you with just one more outlet but what's great about it from the test that have been done is if you don't want to hear it you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it so we create silence as much as we create sound ATMs to talk to you nobody else hears it sitting bad 2 in the morning watch TV or spouses or someone is next to you asleep doesn't hear it doesn't wake up we're also working on noise cancelling cancelling things like snoring noise from automobiles. I have been really lucky with this technology all of a sudden as it is ready the world is ready to accept it they have literally beat a path to our door we've been selling it since about last September October and it's been immensely gratifying if you're interested in what it costs I'm not selling him today but this unit with the electronics and everything if you buy one is around a thousand bucks we expect by this time next year it'll be a hundred few hundred bucks to buy up it's not any more pricey than regular Electronics when I played it for you you didn't hear the Thunders Bass. this Unity by playing goes from about 200 hurts to above the range of hearing it's actually emitting ultrasound low-level ultrasound it's about 100,000 vibrations per second. and the sound of your hearing on like a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face is made out in front of it in the air. we are is not linear as we've always been taught. you turn up the volume just a little bit I'm talking about a little over eighty decibels and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate here's why the speed of sound is not a constant fairly slow it changes with temperature and with barometric pressure now imagine a few well without getting too technical I'm making a little sine wave here in the air. well if I turn up the amplitude too much I'm having an effect on the pressure. which means during the making of that signed way of the speed at which it is propagating is shifting. all of audio as we know it. is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear linear ready means higher quality sound. Hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite it's 100% based on non-linearity. an effect happens in the air it's a corrupting effect of the sound the ultrasound in this case that they emitted. but it's so predictable that you can produce very precise audio out of that affect now the question is where is the sound a state of being made on the face of the con it's made at literally billions of little independent points along this narrow column in the air. and so when I am at towards you what you hear is made right next to your ears I said we can shorten the column we can spread it out over the couch I can put it so that one ear hears one speaker the other ear hears the other that's true binaural sound when you listen to Stereo on your home system. you're both ears hear both speakers turn on the left speaker sometime and noticed you're hearing it also on your right here so the stage is more restricted the soundstage supposed to spread out in front of because the sound is made in the air along this column it does not follow the inverse Square law which says it drops off about two-thirds every time you double the distance 6tb Everytime You Go from one meter for instance 2 to meters. that means you go to rock concert or Symphony and the guy in the front row get the same level as the guy in the back row now all of a sudden in that terrific so we've been as I say very successful very lucky in having a company's catch the vision of this from cars car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids a separate system the back another kids aren't driving today. I was seeing if you're listening actually I haven't had breakfast yet I stereo system in the front for Mom and Dad and maybe there's a little DVD player in the back for the kids and the parents don't want to be bothered with that or their rap music or whatever so again this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on it also works for transmitting and communicating data. it also works five times better underwater. we got the military had just deployed some of these into a rack where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside. or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some biblical verse. I'm serious.. And they have these infrared devices that can look at their countenance and see a fraction of a degree Kelvin in temperature shift from a hundred yards away when they play this thing and so another way I hope hopefully determining who's friendly and who isn't we make a version of this which puts out 155 decibels pain is 120. so it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people and there can be a public beach just off to the side and they don't even know it's turned on. we sell those to the military presently for about $70,000 and they're buying them as fast as we can make them we put it on a turret with a camera so that when they shoot at you if you're over there and it's there. I have a bunch of other inventions I invented a plasma antenna to shift gears looked up in the ceiling in my office one day it was working on a ground-penetrating radar project and my business is c e l came in and said we have a real problem we're using very short wavelengths. we got a problem the antenna ringing when you're on very short wavelengths like a tuning fork the antenna resonates and there is more energy coming out of the antenna then there is the Backscatter from the ground that we're trying to analyze taking too much processing I says why do we make an antenna that only exists when you want it. turn it on turn it off that's a fluorescent tube. refined. I just sold that for a million and a half dollars cash I took it back to the Pentagon after it got Declassified when the patent issued and told the people back there about it and they laughed and then I took him back a demo and they bought any of you ever worn a Jabra headphones little sell headphones that's my invention they sold that 47 million dollars big mistake I just sold 480 million dollars 2 years ago I actually drew that up on a little chromey Mac computer in my attic at my house and the one of the many designs which they have now is still the same design I drew way back now so I've been really lucky as an inventor I'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet. and my dad died before he realized anybody in the family would maybe hopefully make something out of themselves you've been a great audience is when I get up in front of a group let me give you in the last minute one more quick demo this guy. for those of you who haven't heard it. never tell if it's on if you haven't heard of a man. getting it get the cameraman. yeah there you go I've got a Coke can opening this right in your head that's really cool thank you once again",0.8072916269302368
MarcPachter_2008P,but i promise you it was the right question this was to agnes de mille agnes de mille is one of the great choreographers in our history she basically created the dances in oklahoma transforming the american theater an amazing woman at the time that i proposed to her that  by the way i would have proposed to her she was extraordinary but proposed to her that she come on she said come to my apartment she lived new york which at that point when i created this program seemed really old sixties seventies eighties and nineties for obvious reasons it doesn't seem that old anymore come to my apartment and we'll talk for those fifteen minutes and then we'll decide whether we proceed and so i showed up in this  dark rambling new york apartment and she called out to me and she was in bed i had known that she had had a stroke and that was some ten years before and so she spent almost all of her life in bed  but i speak of the life force her hair was askew she wasn't about to make up for this occasion and she was sitting there surrounded by books and her most  unhappy about this she was resigned she said i keep this will by my bed memento mori and i change it all the time just because i want to and she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life i thought this is somebody i've got to get in this series she agreed she came on of course she was wheelchaired on half of her body was stricken the other half not  she was of course done up for the occasion but this was a woman in great physical distress and we had a conversation and then i asked this unthinkable question i said was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful and and why did i do that well for one thing we're a youth obsessed culture and i thought really what we need is an elders program to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk the audience just you know they're always on the side of the interviewee and they felt that this was a kind of assault but this was the question she had wanted somebody to ask her whole life and she began to talk about her childhood when she was beautiful light steps and so forth and then she said and then puberty hit and she began to talk about things that had happened to her body and her face and how she could no longer count on her beauty and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one for whom all the ballet lessons were given and she had to go along just to be with her sister for company and in that process she made a number of decisions  first of all was that dance even though it hadn't been offered to her was her life and secondly she had better be although she did dance for a while a choreographer because then her looks didn't matter but she was thrilled to get that out as a real real fact in her life it was an amazing privilege to do this series there were other moments like that very few moments of silence  the key point was empathy because everybody in their lives is really waiting for people to ask them questions so that they can be truthful about who they are and how they became what they are and i commend that to you  even if you're not doing interviews just be that way with your friends and particularly the older members of your family thank you very much but the second part of it and the the older i get the more convinced i am that that's true it's amazing what people will say when they know how the story turned out that's the one advantage that older people have well they have other little bit of advantage but they also have some disadvantages but the one thing they or we have is that we've reached the point in life where we know how the story turned out so we can then go back in our lives if we've got an interviewer who gets and begin to reflect on how we got there all of those accidents that wound up creating the life narrative that we inherited the national portrait gallery is the place dedicated to presenting great american lives amazing people and so i thought okay now what is it going to take to make this work there are many kinds of interviews we know them there are the journalist interviews which are the interrogation that is expected this is somewhat against resistance and caginess on the part of the interviewee then there's the celebrity interview where it's more important who 's asking the question than who answers that's barbara walters and others like that and we like that that's frost nixon where frost seems to be as important as nixon in that process fair enough but i wanted interviews that were different i wanted to be as i later thought of it empathic which is to say to feel what they wanted to say and to be an agent of their self revelation  by the way this was always done in public this was not an oral history program this was all about three hundred people sitting at the feet of this individual and having me be the brush in their self portrait  now it turns out that i was pretty good at that i didn't know it coming into it and the only reason i really now that is because of one interview i did with senator william fullbright and that was six months after he'd had a stroke  and he had never appeared in public since that point this was not a devastating stroke but it did affect his speaking and so forth that's what it's about we use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives but that's it and so i'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today and i thought it was worth a chance he thought it was worth a chance and so we got up on the stage and we an hour conversion about his life and after  a woman rushed up to me essentially did and she said where did you train as a doctor and i said i have no training as a doctor i never claimed that and she said well something very weird was happening when he started a sentence particularly in the early parts of the interview and paused you gave him the word the bridge to get to the end of the sentence and by the end of it he was speaking complete sentences on i didn't know what was going on but i was so part of the process of getting that out so i thought okay fine i've got empathy or empathy at any rate is what's critical to this kind of interview but then i began to think of other things who makes a great interview in this context it had nothing to do with their it was about their energy it's energy that creates extraordinary interviews and extraordinary lives i'm convinced of it and it had nothing to do with the energy i'm going to talk about a program i started there which from my point of view is the proudest thing i did of being young these were people through their nineties in fact the first person i interviewed was george abbott who was ninety seven and abbott was filled with the life force i guess that's the way i think about it filled with it and so he filled the room and we had an extraordinary conversation he was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do because he was famous for being silent for never ever saying anything except maybe a word or two and in fact he did wind up opening up by the way very gruff voice from a woman i didn't know who she was and she said did you get george abbott to talk and i said yeah apparently i did and she said i 'm his old and i could never do it and then she made me go up with the tape of it and that george abbott actually could talk so you know you want energy you want the life force but you really want them also to think that they have a story worth sharing the worst interviews that you can ever have are with people who are modest never ever get up on a stage with somebody who 's modest because all of these people have been assembled i started to worry about the fact that a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore and they're amazing people and we want to deliver them to future generations so how do we do that to listen to them and they sit there and they say aw shucks it was an accident there's nothing that ever happens that justifies people taking good hours of the day to be with them the worst interview i ever did william l shirer the journalist who did the rise and fall of the third this guy had met hitler and gandhi within six months and every time i'd ask him about it he'd say oh i just happened to be there didn't matter whatever  awful i never would ever agree to interview a modest person they have to think that they did something and that they want to share it with you but it comes down in the end to how do you get through all the barriers we have all of us are public and private beings and if all you're going to get from the interviewee is their public self there's no point in it it's pre programmed it's infomercial and we all have infomercials about our lives we know the great lines we know the great moments we know what we're not going to share  and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody this wasn't and some of you will remember mike wallace 's old interviews tough  of the public self and the more public they had been the more entrenched that person that outer person was and let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment that happened in this interview series it all has to do with that shell that most of us have and particularly certain people woman named clare boothe luce it'll be your generational determinant as to whether her name means much to you and so i came up with the idea of the living self portrait series and the living self portrait series was the idea of basically my being a brush in the hand of amazing people who would come and i would interview she did so much she was a playwright she did an extraordinary play called the women she was  a congresswoman when there weren't very many congresswomen she was editor of vanity fair one of the great phenomenal women and incidentally i call her the eleanor roosevelt of the right she was sort of adored on the right the way eleanor roosevelt was on the left and in fact when we did the interview i did the living self portrait with her  there were three former directors of the cia basically sitting at her feet just enjoying her presence and i thought this is going to be a piece of cake because i always have you don't get it on the stage so she and i had a delightful conversation we were on the stage and then by the way spectacular it was all part of clare boothe luce 's look she was in a great evening gown she was eighty she stonewalled me it was unbelievable anything that i would ask she would turn around dismiss  and i was basically up there any of you in the moderate to full entertainment world know what it is to die onstage and i was dying she was absolutely not giving me a thing and i began to wonder what was going on and you think while you talk and basically i thought i got it when we were alone i was her audience now i'm her competitor for the audience that's the problem here and she's fighting me for that and so then i asked her a question i didn't know how i was going to get out of it i asked her a question about  her days as a playwright and again characteristically instead of saying oh yes i was a playwright and  that and then she went off on a tear and she said oh well there was that one time that i was an actress it was for a charity in connecticut when i was a congresswoman and i got up there and she went on and on and then i got on the stage she looked at me and it was like the successful arm wrestle and then after that she delivered an extraordinary account of what her life really was like i have to end that one this is my tribute to clare boothe luce again a remarkable person i'm not politically attracted to her but through her life force  of how you encounter people in that kind of situation what you try to find out about them and when people deliver and when they don't and why i'm attracted to her and the way she died she had toward the end a brain tumor that's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine and very few of us were invited to a dinner party and she was in horrible pain we all knew that she stayed in her room everybody came the butler passed around canapes the usual sort of thing then at a certain moment the door opened and she walked out perfectly dressed completely composed the public self the beauty the intellect and she walked around and talked to every person there and then went back into the room and was never seen again she wanted the control of her final moment and she did it amazingly now there are other ways that you get somebody to open up and this is just a brief reference it wasn't this arm wrestle but it was a little surprising for the person involved i interviewed steve martin it wasn't all that long ago and we were sitting there and almost toward the beginning of the interview i turned to him and i said  mister martin it is said that all comedians have unhappy was yours unhappy and he looked at me you know as if to say this is how you're going to start this thing right off and then he turned to me not stupidly and he said what was your childhood like and i said these are all arm wrestles but they're affectionate and i said my father was loving and supportive which is why i'm not funny now i had two preconditions one was that they be american that's just because in the nature of the national portrait gallery it's created to look at american lives he looked at me and then we heard the big sad story his father was an sob and in fact he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood but then we were off and running so the question is what is the key that's going to allow this to proceed now these are arm wrestle questions but i want to tell you about  one was an interview i did with one of the great american biographers again some of you will know him most of you won 't dumas malone he did a five volume biography of thomas jefferson spent virtually his whole life with thomas jefferson and by the way at one point i asked him would you like to have met him and he said well of course but actually i know him better than anyone who ever met him because i got to read all of his letters so he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over fifty years and i asked one question i said did jefferson ever disappoint you and here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering jefferson and connecting with him and he said well i'm going to do a bad southern accent dumas malone was from mississippi originally but he said well he said i 'm afraid so he said you know i've read everything and sometimes mister jefferson would smooth the truth a bit and he that was easy but then i made the decision maybe arbitrary that they needed to be people of a certain age he said i understand that he said we southerners do like a smooth surface so that there were times when he just didn't want the confrontation and he said now john adams was too honest and he started to talk about that and later on he invited me to his house and i met his wife who was from massachusetts and he and she had exactly the relationship of thomas jefferson and john adams  the new englander and abrasive and he was this courtly fellow but really the most important question i ever asked and most of the times when i talk about it people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity or cruelty ,the National Portrait Gallery is the place dedicated to presenting Great American lives amazing people and that's what it's about we use portraits the way to deliver those lives but that's it and so I'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today I'm going to talk about a program I started there which for my point of view is the the the proudest thing I did. I started to worry about the fact that a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore and they're amazing people and we want to deliver them to Future Generations so how do we do that and so I came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series and the living self-portrait Siri was the idea basically my being a brush in the hand of amazing people would come in I would interview so what I'm going to do is not so much give you the the great hits of that program has to give you this whole notion of how you encounter people in that kind of situation what you try to find out about them and when people deliver and when they don't and why now I have to pre-condition one was that they be American that's just because of the nature of the National Portrait Gallery it's created to look at American lives that was that was easy but I made the decision that they needed to be. people of a certain age which at that point when I created this program seemed really old 60s 70s 80s and 90s for obvious reasons it doesn't seem that old anymore to me and what why did I do that well for one thing we're youth obsessed culture and I thought really what we need is an Elders program to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk but the second part of it and I add the more the older I get the more convinced I am that that's true. it's amazing what people will say when they know how the story turned out that's the one advantage that older people have other have other little bit of damage but they also had some disadvantages but the one thing they or we have is that we've reached the point in life where we know how the story turned out so we can then go back in our lives if we've got an interviewer who gets that and begin to reflect on how we got there all of those accidents that wound up creating the life narrative that we inherited so I thought okay now what is it going to take to make this work there aren't many kinds of interviews we know them to the journalist interviews with truth the interrogation that is expected this is somewhat against resistance and caginess and the part of the interviewee then there's the the celebrity interview where it's more important who's asking the question that who answers that's Barbara Walters and. others like that and we we like that that's Frost Nixon where frosting to be as important as Nixon of that process fair enough but I wanted interviews that were different I want it to be as I later thought of it empathic which is to say to feel what they wanted to say and to be an agent of their self-revelation out by the way this was always done in public this was not an oral history program this was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual and having me beat the brush in their self portrait that I didn't know I'd coming into it and the only reason I really know that is because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright and that was six months after he had a stroke. and he never appeared in public since that point this was not a devastating stroke but it did affect his speaking and so forth and I thought it was worth a chance he thought it was worth a chance and so we got up on the on the stage and we had an hour conversation about his life and after that a woman rushed up to me it's actually did it she said where did you train the doctor and I said I have no training at the doctor I never claimed that and she said was something very weird was happening when he started a sentence for to clean the early parts of the interview and pause you gave him the word the bridge to get to the end of the fence and by the end of it he was speaking complete sentences on his house I didn't know what was going on but I was so part of the process of getting that out so I thought okay fine. I've got empathy or empathy at any rate is with critical to this kind of. but then I began to think of other things who made a great interview in this in this context it had nothing to do with their intellect the quality of their intellect some of them were very brilliant some of them were you no ordinary people who would never claimed to be intellectuals but it was never about that it was about their energy is energy that creates extraordinary interviews and extraordinary live I'm convinced of it and it had nothing to do with the energy of being young these were people through their 90s in fact the first person I interviewed with Georgia but it was 97. and Abbott was filled with the life force I guess that's the way I think about it filled with it and so he filled the room and we had an extraordinary conversation he was supposed to be the toughest interview than anybody would ever do because he was famous for being silent for never ever saying anything except maybe a word or two and in fact he did wind up opening up by the way his energy is evidence another way he subsequently got married again at 102 so he sent him but after the interview I got a call very Gruff voice from a woman I didn't know who had she wasn't she said did you get George Abbott to talk. and I said yeah apparently I did and she said I'm his old girlfriend Maureen Stapleton and I could never do it and then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that your job and actually could talk so you know you what you want energy you want the life force but. you really want them also to think that they have a story worth sharing the worst interviews that you can ever have are with people who are modest never ever get up on the stage with somebody whose modest because all of these people have been assembled to listen to them and they sit there and they say off shocks it was an accident there's nothing ever that happens that justifies people taking good hours of the day to be with them the worst interview I've ever did William aleshire the journalist who did the ryzen the rise and fall of the Third Reich this guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months and every time I've asked him about it he said oh I just happened to be there didn't matter whatever awful LOL I never will ever agree to interview a modest person to have to think that they did something and then they want to share it with you. but it comes down in the end to. how do you get through all the barriers that we have all of us are public and private beings and if all you're going to get from the interviewee is there public self there's no pointed it's preprogrammed it's infomercial and we all have The infomercials about our lives we know the gray lines we know the Great Moments we know what we're not going to share and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody this wasn't some of you will remember Mike Wallace is old interviews tough aggressive and so poor that they have their place I was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say to break a hold of their own Cocoon of of the public self and the more public they have been the more entrenched that that that person that other person was and let me tell you at once the worst moment in the best. moment that happened in this interview serious it all has to do with that she'll then most of us have and particularly certain people there's an extraordinary woman named Clare Boothe Luce it'll be your generational determinant as to whether her name means much to you she did so much she was a playwright she did an extraordinary play called the women she was a congresswoman where there weren't very many congress women she was editor of Vanity Fair one of the great phenomenal women of her day and incidentally. I call it the Eleanor Roosevelt of the right she was so different Jord on the right the way Eleanor Roosevelt was on the left and in fact when we did the interview I did the living self-portrait with her there were three former directors of the CIA basically sitting at her feet just enjoying her her presents and I thought it's going to be a piece of cake because I always have preliminary talks with these people for just maybe 10 or 15 minutes we never talked before that because of your talk before you don't get it on the stage so she and I had a delightful conversation we were on the stage and then. by the way spectacular was all part of Clare Boothe Luce is look she has she was in a great evening. She was 80 almost at day of the interview and there she wasn't there I was and I just proceeded into the question and she stonewalled me it was unbelievable anything that I would ask she would turn around this mess and I was basically up there any of you of you in the moderate to full entertainment World know what is the die on stage and I was dying she was absolutely not giving me a thing and I began to wonder what was going on and you think while you talk and basically I thought I got it. when we were alone I was her audience now I'm her competitor for the audience that's the problem here and she's fighting me for that and said that I asked her a question I didn't know how I was going to get out of it I asked her a question about. of her days as a playwright and it again characteristically instead of saying who yes I was a Play Ride in this is what she said that I was an actress I was never an actress but I hadn't asked that and then she went off on a tear and she said oh well there was that one time that I was an actress I was for a charity in Connecticut when I was in Congress woman then I got up there and she went on and on and then I got on the stage and then she turned to me and she said and you know what those young actors did they upstage me and she said you know what that is just wither and her contempt that I said I'm learning. and she looked at me and it was like the successful arm wrestle and then after that she delivered an extraordinary account of what her life really was like I have to end that when this is my tribute to Clare Boothe Luce again a remarkable person I'm not politically attracted to her but through her life-force I'm attracted to her and the way she died she had for the end of brain tumor that's probably is terrible away to die as you can imagine and very few of us were invited to a dinner party and she was in horrible pain we we all knew that she stayed in her room everybody came do you know the butler passed around 10 of his usual sort of thing then at a certain moment the door opened. and she walked out perfectly dressed completely compose the public self the beauty the intellect and she walked around and talked to every person there and then went back into the room and was never seen again she wanted the control of her final moment and she did it amazingly now there are other ways that you get somebody to open up and this is just a brief reference it wasn't this arm wrestle but it was a little surprising for the person involved and reviewed Steve Martin it wasn't all that long ago. and we were sitting there and almost for the beginning of the interview I turned to him and I said Steve Martin it is said that all comedians have unhappy childhood was yours unhappy and he looked at me and now is to say this is how you're going to start this thing you know right off and then he turned to me not stupidly and he said what was your childhood like. and I said these are all arm wrestles but they're affectionate and I said my father was loving and supportive which is why I'm not funny. he looked at me and then we heard that the big sad story his father was an sob and in fact it was another comedian with an unhappy childhood but then we were off and running to the question is what is the key that's going to allow this to proceed now these These are arm wrestle fish but I want I want to tell you about questions that are more related to empathy and that really very often of the questions that people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked and I'll just give you two examples of this because of the of the time constraint when was an interview I did with one of the Great American biographers again some of you will know most of you won't do mom alone he did five volume biography of Thomas Jefferson virtually his whole life with Thomas Jefferson and by the way but actually. I know him better than anyone who ever met him because I got to read all of his letters so he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over fifty years and I asked him. one question I said did Jefferson ever disappoint you. and who's this man who'd given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson and connecting with him and and he he he he said well I'm going to do a bad southern accent do my Malone was from Mississippi originally but he said well he said I'm afraid so. he said you know I've read everything and sometimes mr. Jefferson would smooth the truth of it. and he basically was saying that this was a man who lied more that he wish he had because he saw the letters he said but I understand that he said I understand that I said we Southerners do like a smooth surface so that these there was a x when he just didn't want the confrontation he said now John Adams was too honest and he started to talk about that later on he invited me to his house and I met his wife was for Massachusetts and he and she had exactly the relationship of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams she was the New England during abrasive and he was his courtly fellow but really the most important question I ever asked and most of the times when I talked about it it would kind of suck in their breath at my audacity or cruelty but I promise you it was it was the right question this was to Agnes de Mille. Agnes Miller was one of the great choreographers in our history she basically created the dances in Oklahoma transforming the American Theater an amazing woman at the time that I proposed to her that by the way I would have proposed to her she was extraordinary about the proposed to her that she come on she said come to my apartment she should lived in the in New York come to my apartment and we'll talk for those 15 minutes and then we'll we'll we'll decide whether we proceed and so I showed up in this dark rambling New York apartment and she called out to me and she was in bed I had known that she had had a stroke and that was some ten years before and so she spent almost all of her life in bed but I speak of the life force her hair was Askew she wasn't about to to make up for this occasion and she was sitting there surrounded by books and her most. interesting possession she felt at that moment was her will which she had by her side not self she wasn't unhappy about this she was resign she she she said I keep this will buy my bed Memento Mori and I change it all the time. just because I want to and she was she was loving the prospect of death as much as she is love life I thought this is somebody I've got to get in the series she agreed she came on of course she was a wheelchair on half of her body was stricken the other half not she was of course then up the occasion but this is the woman in great physical distress and we had is a conversation and then I asked her this Unthinkable question. I said is it a problem for you. was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful. and. the audience just I mean they're always on the side of the interviewee and they felt that this was a kind of assault but this was the question she had asked if she'd wanted somebody to ask her whole life and she began to talk about her childhood when she was beautiful and she literally she turned her she was in this broken body and she turned to the audience and described herself as the motel with her red hair and her light steps and so forth and then she said and then puberty yet and she began to talk about things that have happened to her body and her face and how she could no longer count on her beauty and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one for whom all the ballet lessons were given that she has to go along just to be with her sister for company and in that process she made a number decision first. call with a dance even though it hadn't been offered to her was her life and secondly she had better be although she did dance for a while a choreographer because then her looks didn't matter but she was thrilled to get that out as a real real fact in her life. it was an amazing privilege to do this series there were other moments like that very few moments of Silence the key point was empathy because everybody in their lives is really waiting for people to ask them questions so that they can be truthful about who they are and how they became what they are and I commend that to you even if you're not doing interviews just be that way with your friends and particularly the older members of your family thank you very much,0.7317708730697632
PeterEigen_2009X,i used to work as the director of the world bank office in nairobi for east africa at that time i noticed that corruption that grand corruption that systematic corruption was undermining everything we were trying to do and therefore i began to not only try to protect the work of the world bank our own projects our own programs against corruption but in general i thought we need a system to protect the people in this part of the world from the ravages of corruption and as soon as i started this work i received a memorandum from the world bank from the legal department first in which they said you're not allowed to do this going to speak about corruption but i would like to juxtapose two different things one is the large global economy the large globalized economy  in the mean time i was chairing donor meetings for instance in which the various donors and many of them like to be in nairobi it is true it is one of the cities of the world but they like to be there because the other cities are even less comfortable and in these donor meetings i noticed that many of the worst projects which were put forward by our clients by the governments by promoters many of them representing suppliers from the north that the worst projects were realized first let me give you an example a huge power project three hundred million dollars to be built smack into one of the most vulnerable and one of the most beautiful areas of western kenya and we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits it had no clients nobody would buy the electricity there nobody was interested in irrigation projects to the contrary we knew that this project would destroy would destroy riparian forests which were the basis for the survival of nomadic groups the samburu and the so everybody knew this is a not a useless project this is an absolute damaging a terrible project not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country for these hundreds of millions of dollars and the siphoning off the scarce resources of the economy from much more important activities like schools like hospitals and so on and yet the good projects which we as a donor community would take under our wings they took years you know you had too many studies and very often they didn't succeed but these bad projects which were absolutely damaging for the economy for many generations for the environment for thousands of families who had to be resettled suddenly put together by consortia of banks of supplier agencies of and the other one is the small and very limited capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions to govern to shape this economy because there is this  between the powerful elites in the countries there and the suppliers from the north now these suppliers were our big companies they were the actors of this global market which i mentioned in the beginning they were the siemenses of this coming from france from the uk from japan from canada from germany and they were systematically driven by systematic large scale corruption we are not talking about fifty thousand dollars here or one hundred thousand dollars there or one million dollars there no we are talking about ten million twenty million dollars on the swiss bank accounts on the bank accounts of the president 's ministers the high officials in the para statal sectors this was the reality which i saw and not only one project like that i saw i would say over the years i worked in africa i saw hundreds of projects and so i became convinced that this systematic corruption which is perverting economic policy making in these countries  which is the main reason for the misery for the poverty for the conflicts for the violence for the desperation in many of these that we have today more than a billion people below the absolute poverty line that we have more than a billion people without proper drinking water in the world twice that number more than two billion people without sanitation and so on and the consequent illnesses mothers and children still child mortality of more than ten million people every year children dying  five years old the cause of this is to a large extent grand corruption now why did the world bank not let me do this work germany foreign bribery was allowed it was even tax deductible no wonder that most of the most important international operators in germany but also in france and uk and scandinavia everywhere systematically bribed not all of them but most of  and this is the phenomenon which i call failing governance because when i then came to germany and started this little ngo here in berlin at the told you cannot stop our german exporters from bribing because we will lose our contracts  we will lose to the french we will lose to the swedes we'll lose to the japanese and therefore there was a indeed a prisoner 's dilemma which made it very difficult  which creates basically failing governance for an individual company an individual exporting country to say we are not going to continue this deadly  of large companies to bribe so this is what i mean with a failing governance structure because even the powerful government which we have in germany comparatively was not able to say we will not allow our companies to bribe and the large companies themselves have this dilemma many of them didn't want to bribe many of the german companies for instance believe that they are really producing a high quality product at a good price so they are very competitive they are not as good at bribing as many of their international competitors failing governance in many areas in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of the environment in the area of exploitation of women and children  but they were not allowed to show their strengths because the world was eaten up by grand corruption and this is why i'm telling you this civil society rose to the occasion we had a small ngo transparency international they began to think of an escape route from this prisoner 's dilemma and we developed concepts of collective action basically trying to bring various competitors together around the table explaining to all of them how much it would be in their interests if they simultaneously would stop  convention under the auspices of the oecd which obliged everybody to change their laws and criminalize foreign bribery i mean it's interesting in doing this we had to sit together with the companies we had here in berlin  aspen institute on the wannsee we had sessions with about twenty captains of industry and we discussed with them  what to do about international bribery in the first session we had three sessions over the course of two years and president von weizsacker by the way chaired one of the sessions the first one to take the fear away in the area of climate change in all the areas in which we really need a capacity to reintroduce the primacy of politics  from the entrepreneurs who were not used to deal with non governmental organizations and in the first session they all said this is not bribery what we are doing this is customary there this is what these other cultures demand they even applaud it in fact still says this today and so there are still a lot of people who are not convinced that who have to stop bribing but in the second session they admitted already that they would never do this what they are doing in these other countries here in germany or in the uk and so on cabinet ministers would admit this and in the final session at the aspen institute we had them all sign an open letter the kohl government at the time requesting that they participate in the oecd convention and this is in my opinion an example of soft power because we were able to convince them that they had to go with us we had a longer term time perspective we had a broader geographically much wider london for instance where the bae got away with a huge corruption case which the serious fraud office tried to prosecute hundred million british pounds every year for ten years to one particular official of one particular friendly country who then bought for forty four billion pounds of military equipment this case they are not prosecuting in the uk why because they consider this as contrary to the security interest of the people civil society is pushing civil society is trying to get a solution to this problem and also in the uk and also in japan which is not properly enforcing and so on in germany we are pushing the ratification of the un convention which is a subsequent convention we are germany is not ratifying why because it would make it necessary to criminalize the corruption of deputies in germany we have a system where the economy which is operating in a worldwide arena and i think corruption you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant but you are allowed to bribe a deputy this is and the members of parliament don't want to change this and this is why they can't sign the un convention against foreign bribery one of they very very few countries  which is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world but not able to ratify they convention which we managed to get on the books with about one hundred and sixty countries i see my time is ticking let me just try to draw some conclusions from what has happened i believe  what we managed to achieve in fighting corruption one can also achieve in other areas of failing governance by now the united nations on our side the world bank has turned from saulus to paulus under wolfensohn and they became i would say the strongest anti corruption agency in the  most of the large companies are now totally convinced that they have to put in place very strong policies against bribery and so on and this is possible because civil society joined the companies and joined the government in the analysis of the problem in the development of remedies in the implementation of reforms and then later in the  and the fight against corruption and the impact of corruption is probably one of the most interesting ways to illustrate what i mean with this failure of governance of course if civil society organizations want to play that role they have to grow into this responsibility not all civil society organizations are good the ku klux klan is an ngo so we must be aware that civil society has to shape up itself they have to have a much more  transparent financial governance they have to have a much more participatory governance in many civil society organizations we also need much more competence of civil society leaders this is why we have set up the governance school and the center for civil society here in berlin because we believe most of our educational and research institutions in germany and continental europe in general do not focus enough yet empowering civil society and training the leadership but what i'm saying from my very practical experience if civil society does it right and joins the other actors in particular governments governments and  thank you talk about my own experience ,"I'm going to speak about corruption but I would like to truck supposed to difference thinks one is the large global economy lodge globalized economy. and the other one is a small and very limited capacity of our traditional governments and the international institutions to govern to shape the economy. this. this symmetry that creates basically feeling dominance. finding covenants in many areas and area of corruption in the area of destruction of the environment in the area of rotation of women and children in the area of climate change in all the areas in between really need a capacity to reintroduce the Primacy of politics into the economy is operating in a in a road B Arena. and I think perhaps you and the fight against corruption and the impact of grab the probably one of the most interesting ways to illustrate what I mean versus Halo. take me to talk about my own experience I used to work as the Director of the World Bank office in Nairobi 44 East Africa at that time I noticed that corruption that transfer option that systematically undermining everything we are trying to do and therefore I began to not only try to protect the work of the word Bank hours on projects and programs against corruption to protect the people in this part of the word from the ravages of production. and as soon as I started this work I received a memorandum from the word time from the legal department for a sandwich they said you are not allowed to do this you are meddling in the internal affairs of a popular countries for bitten by the charter of the bank so I want you to stop doing this in the meantime I was sharing Dona meetings for instance in which the various donuts and many of them like to be in Nairobi it is true it is one of the unsafest cities of the weather be like to be there because the other cities unless comfortable and in these meetings I noticed that many of the first project we put forward by our clients by the government's by promoters many often representing the supplies from the nose that diverse projects where realized first let me give you an example of the power project. three hundred million dollars into one of the most beautiful areas of Western Kenya and you notice immediately that this project have no economic benefits have no clients nobody would buy the electricity there nobody was interested in irrigation project to the contrary mean you that this project will destroy the environment will destroy and repairing orders basis for the survival of nomadic groups is samburu and they took this area so everybody knew this is a mother use this project is not to speak about future indebtedness of the country for the hundreds of millions of dollars anti-siphoning of the office scarce resources of the economy from much more important activities like schools and hospitals in Florida. and yet be all rejected this project none of the donuts with feeling to have the name for necklace and it was the first product to be implemented the good projects with me as a community would take under our wings they took years too many studies and very often they didn't succeed but he's better which we are absolutely damaging for the economy for many generations for the environment for thousands of families who had to be reset and Sunday put together a Consortium of banks offer Supply Agencies Insurance agencies like in Germany have a mess and so on and they came back very very quickly driven by an Unholy alliance between the powerfulest Elite in in the country singer and they Supply us from the north. Welding Supply us where our big companies are the actors of the global market which I mentioned in the beginning they coming from France from the UK from Japan from Canada from Germany and Dave are systematically driven by systematic large-scale corruption and we're not talking about $50,000 here $100,000 there a $1000000 on the Swiss bank account on the bank account of Liechtenstein often as a president's ministers the high officials in the parastatal sectors this false reality I would say over the years I have looked enough like I saw hundreds of products. and so I became convinced that it is this systematic corruption which is perverting economic policymaking in these countries which is the main reason for the misery as a poverty for the conflict for the violence for the desperation in many of these countries. that we have today more than a billion people with his Jose absolute poverty line that you have more than a billion people without drinking water cool more than two billion people without sanitation in song and the consequent illnesses or mothers and children still have more than 10 million people every year children dying before they are five-years-old the cause of this large extent current correction. why did the word Bank not let me do this work I found out afterwards after I left under a big fight today the reason was that the members of the word Pang thought that foreign bribery was okay including Germany Germany foreign bribery was allowed it was even texted back to no one. Most of the most important International operators in Germany and Scandinavia. and this is the phenomenon which I call painting, that's because when I then came to Germany and start at this little NGO here in Berlin we you cannot stop our German exporters from driving because we will lose our contract we will lose to the French you lose those treats for you today Japanese and therefore there was indeed a prisoner's dilemma which made it very difficult for an individual company and individual to save me are not going to continue this deadly disasters habit of large companies to Bright. so this is what I mean with a failing governance structure because even the powerful government position in Germany comparative Lee was not able to say we will not allow our companies to arrive abroad they need his help. and a large company sends help set this dilemma many of them didn't want to bribe many of the German companies Francis belief that they are already producing high-quality products at a good price so they are very competitive and as many of their International competitors are to show them because the bird was eaten up by Grandpa Rodger. and. this is why I'm telling you this Civil Society Rose to the occasion we had two small NGO Transparency International you begin to think of an escape food from this prisoner's dilemma and we developed concepts of collective action basically trying to bring various competitors together around the table explaining to all of them how much it would be in their interest is a similar changes need to stop driving and to make a long story short we managed to eventually get Germany to sign together with the other oecd countries and a few other exporters in 1997 a convention under the auspices of the oecd which oblige everybody to change the laws and criminalized Van Driver. this is. well thank you I mean it's interesting in doing this we have to stick together with the companies we had here in Berlin on the Aspen Institute has about 20 captains of industry and we discussed with them what to do about International bribery in the first session get three sessions over the course of two years and present from bicycle by the way the first 12 to take the fear away from The Interpreter us who are not used to deal with the governmental organisation and the first session. They all said this is not right or you what you're doing this is customary there this is what these other cultures by the office today and so they are still a lot of people are not convinced that you have to stop writing. but in the second session to admit it already that they would never do this what they're doing in these other countries here in Germany or in the UK and Swan cabinet minister and in the final session at the Aspens if we had them all signed an open letter to the cool guy I met at the time requesting that they participate in the oecd convention and I'm in my opinion an example of soft power because we we were able to convince them that they had to go with us we had a longer-term Time perspective we had a broader Geographic be much wider constituency we are trying to defend and that's why the Lord Has Changed XYZ meant to snow in the Travel Inn and that's why am I getting in some other countries the oecd convention is not yet properly enforced and again Civil Society is breathing down their necks establishment in. London for instance where a bae go to waves are huge corruption case which see a serious Fraud Office try to prosecute 100 million British pounds every year for 10 years to one particular official of one particular friendly country who then vote for 44 million pounds of military equipment this case in the UK why because they consider this country to the security interests of the people of paper with solution to this problem also in the UK and also in Japan which is not properly in 46 and 2 on the ratification of the UN convention convention we are buying why because it would make it necessary to criminalize the corruption of deputies and we have a sister. you are not allowed to fly a civil servant but you are allowed to bribe a deputy this is Sandra and this is why they conned time the UN convention against foreign bribery one of the very few countries which is preaching honesty and put Gavin and everywhere in the world but not able to ratify the convention has he managed to get on the book that's about 160 countries all over the world. I see my time is ticking and let me try to draw some conclusions what has happened and I believe that's what we managed to achieve in corruption but can also achieve in other areas of alien Covenant by now the United Nations The Story of an Hour on our side and an avoidance and they became I would say the strongest anti-corruption agency is also a lot of companies are now totally convinced that they have to put in place very strong case against bribery and Swan and this is possible because Civil Society join the company's and drawing the government in the analysis of the problem in the development of Remedies in the implementation of reforms and then later in the morning of the forms. of course if Civil Society organizations want to play that role they have to grow into this responsibility not Society organizations are the Ku Klux Klan it says is an NGO so we must be aware that Civil Society has to have to have a much more transparent Financial governments have to have a much more participatory the government in many Civil Society organizations we also need my competence of Civil Society leaders this is why we have to set up as a government School in the center for civil society and religion because he believed most of our Education and Research institutions in Germany in Continental Europe in general do not focus on empowering Civil Society training the leadership of Civil Society if Society right. and joins the other actress in particular governance governments and international institutions International Actors Access to corporate social responsibility of the triangle between Civil Society government and private sector at a tremendous rate of us to create a better thank you",0.72265625
ZainabSalbi_2010G, and killed him and his father but did not kill his mother or his sister  when the soul lies down in that grass the world is too full to talk about ideas out beyond the there is a field and there are many women and men are meeting there let us make this field a much bigger place let us all meet in that field thank you his mother showed up the next week at my brother 's classroom and begged seven year old kids to share with her any picture they may have of her son for she had lost everything this is not a story of a nameless survivor of war and nameless refugees whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our tv with tattered clothes dirty face scared eyes this is not a story of a nameless someone who lived in some war who we do not know their hopes their dreams their accomplishments their families their beliefs their values is my story was that girl i am in the middle of the night another image and vision of another survivor i am that refugee and i am that you see i grew up in a war torn iraq and i believe that there are two sides of wars and we've only seen with the sound of a heavy explosion it was deep at night i do not one side of it we only talk about one side of it but there's another side that i have witnessed as someone who lived in it and someone who ended up working in i grew up with the colors of war the red colors of fire and the brown tones of earth as it explodes in the piercing silver of an exploded missile so bright that nothing can protect your eyes from it i grew up with the sounds of war the staccato sounds of gunfire the wrenching booms of explosions drones of jets flying overhead and the wailing warning sounds of sirens these are the sounds you but they are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds  screeching in the night the high pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous a friend of mine said is not about sound at all it is actually  of humanity i have since left iraq a group called women for women international that ends up working with women survivors of wars in my travels and in my work from congo to afghanistan from sudan to rwanda i have not only that the colors and the sounds of war are the same  but the fears of war is the same you know there is a fear of dying and do not believe the hero is not afraid it is very scary to go through that feeling of i am about to die or i could die in this explosion the worst kind of fear is the fear as samia a bosnian woman once told me who survived the four years siege of sarajevo she said the fear of in my room was shaking my heart my windows my bed  the i in me of losing the i in me that's what my mother in iraq used to tell me  it's like dying from inside out woman once told me it is not about the fear of one death she said sometimes i feel i die ten times one day as she was describing the marches of soldiers and the sounds of their bullets and she said but it's not fair because there is only one life and there should only be one only seeing one side of war we have only been and consumed with high level preoccupations over troop levels draw down time lines surges and sting operations  when we should be examining the details of where the social fabric has been most torn where the community has improvised and survived and shown acts of resilience and amazing courage just to keep life going i looked out the windows  is the language of sterility how casually we treat casualties in the context of this topic this is where we conceive of rape and casualties as inevitabilities eighty percent of refugees around the world are women and children oh ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians seventy five percent of them are  and i saw a full half circle of explosion i thought it was just like the movies but the movies had not conveyed them in the powerful image that i was seeing women and children how interesting oh half a million women in rwanda get raped in one hundred days or as we speak now  of thousands of congolese women are getting raped and mutilated how interesting these just become numbers that we refer to the front of of wars is increasingly non human eyes peering down on our perceived enemies from space guiding missiles toward unseen targets while the human conduct of the orchestra of media relations in the event that this particular drone we are missing a completely other side of wars we are missing my mother 's story who made sure with every siren with every raid with every cut off of electricity she played puppet shows for my brothers and i so we would not be scared of the sounds of explosions we are missing the story of fareeda a music teacher a piano teacher in sarajevo who made sure that she kept the music school open every single day in the four years of siege in sarajevo and walked to that school despite the snipers shooting at that school and the piano the violin the cello playing the whole duration of the war with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats that was her fight that was her resistance we are missing the story of nehia a palestinian woman in gaza who the minute there was a cease fire in the last year 's war she left out of home full of bright red and orange and gray and a full circle of explosion and i kept on staring at it until we are missing the stories of violet who despite surviving genocide in the church massacre she kept on going on burying bodies cleaning homes cleaning the streets we are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the midst of wars do you do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life going and the ones who are keeping that life are women  are two sides of war there is side that fights and there is a side that keeps the schools and the factories and the hospitals open there is a side that is focused on winning battles and there is a side that is focused on winning life there is a side that leads the front line discussion and there is a side that leads the back line discussion there is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting and there is the side that thinks that peace is the arrival of schools and jobs there is a side that is led it disappeared i went back to my bed and i prayed and i secretly thanked god to understand how do we build lasting peace we must understand war and peace from both sides we must have a full picture of what that means in order for us to understand what peace means we need to understand as one sudanese woman once told me peace is the fact that my toenails are growing back again she grew up in sudan in southern sudan for twenty years of war where it killed one million people and displaced five million refugees many women were taken as slaves by rebels and soldiers as sexual slaves who were forced also to carry the ammunition and the water  and the food for the soldiers so that woman walked for twenty years so she would not be kidnapped again  and only when there was some sort of peace  toenails grew back again we need to understand peace from a toenail 's perspective we need to understand that we cannot actually have negotiations of ending of wars or peace without fully including women at the negotiating table i find it amazing that the only group of people who are not fighting and not killing and not pillaging and not burning and not raping and the group of people who are mostly though not exclusively who are keeping life going in the midst of war are not included at the negotiating table do argue that women lead the back line discussion but there are also men who are excluded from that discussion the doctors who are not fighting  that that missile did not land on my family 's home that it did not kill my family that night the artists the students the men who refuse to pick up the guns they are too excluded from the negotiating tables there is no way we can talk about a lasting peace building of democracy sustainable economies any kind of stability if we do not fully include women  no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don't start investing in women and girls did you know that one year of the world 's military spending equals hundred years of the u n budget and equals two thousand nine hundred and twenty eight years of the u n budget allocated for women if we just reverse that distribution of funds perhaps it is the right thing to do not only because it is the right thing to do for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today but it is for the future and mutilated in front of them and her children saw their nine year old sibling killed in front of them how they're doing okay right now  and i still feel guilty about that prayer for the next day i learned that that missile landed on my brother 's she said but what i worry about the most is not any of that i worry that my children have hate in their hearts and when they grow up they want to fight again the killers of their father and their brother we need to invest in women because that's our only chance to ensure that there is no more war in the future that mother has a better chance to heal her children than any peace agreement can do lots of good news to start with these women that i told you about are dancing and singing every single day and if they can who are we not to dance  that girl that i told you about ended up starting women for women international group that impacted one million people sent eighty million dollars and i started this from zero nothing for a change we have a better equality we have equality we have a representation and we understand war both from the front line and the back line discussion  rumi a thirteenth century sufi poet says out beyond the worlds of right doings and wrong doings there is a field i will meet you there ,I woke up in the middle of the night with a sound of heavy explosion. it was deep at night I do not remember what time it was I just remembered the sound was so heavy and so very shocking. everything in my room was shaking my heart's my windows my beds everything. I looked out the windows. and I sew a full half circle of explosion. I thought it was just like the movies but the movie did not convey them in the powerful image that I was seeing full of bright red and orange and gray and chocolate explosion and I kept on Staring at its until it disappeared. I went back to my vet. and I prayed. and I secretly thank God. that's that missile did not land on my family's home. that it did not kill my family that night. 30 years had passed and I still feel guilty about that prayer. for the next day I learned that that missile landed on my brother's friend's home. I've killed him and his father. but did not kill his mother or his sister. his mother showed up next week with my brother is classroom and Beck seven-year-old kids to share with her any picture they may have of her son. for she had lost everything. this is not a story of a nameless Survivor of War. a nameless refugees who stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our TV with tattered clothes dirty face scared. I have not a story of a nameless Someone who lived in some more who we do not know their hopes their dreams their accomplishment their families their believes their values this is my story. I was that crawl. I am another image and vision of another Survivor of War I am that Refugee I am that girl. you see I grew up in war-torn Iraq. and I believe that they are two sides of wars and we've only seen one side of it. we only talked about the one side of it. what is another side that I have witness as someone who lived in it and someone who end up working in it. I grew up with the colors of war the red color is a Fire and Blood the brown towns of Earth as it explodes in our faces. and the piercing silver of an exploded missile so bright that nothing can protect your eyes from it. I grew up with the sounds of for the taco sounds of gunfire the wrenching Blooms of explosions I mean as drones have jets flying overhead and the Wailing warning sounds of sirens. these are the sounds you would expect but they are also the sounds of definite concerts of a flock of birds. preaching in the nights the high-pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous unbearable silence. you're a friend of mine said is not about sound at all it is actually about silence. Silence of humanity. I have since left Iraq. and founded the group called women for women International that ends up working with women survivors of wars. and my travels and in my work from Congo to Afghanistan from Sudan to Rwanda I have learned not only that the color is in the sounds of War are the same but the fears of war is the same. you know there is a fear of dying and do not believe any movie character with the hero is not afraid it is very scary to go through that feeling of I am about to die or I could die in this explosion. it is also the fear of losing loved ones and I think that's even worse it's too painful you don't want to think about. but I think the worst kind of fear is the fear of Somalia a Bosnian woman once told me who survived the four years of the siege of Sarajevo she said the fear of losing the eye and me. a fear of losing the eye and me that's what my mother any Rock used to tell me. it's like dying from inside out. a Palestinian woman wants told me it is not about the fear of one that she said sometimes I feel I die 10 times in one day as she was describing the marches of soldier is in the sounds of their bullets because there is only one life and there should only be one death. we have been. only seeing one side of for we have only been discussing and consumed with high-level preoccupations over troops levels drown down timeline searches and sting operations when we should be examining the details of where the social fabric has been most torn where the community has improvise and survive and show acts of resilience and amazing courage just to keep life going. we have been so consumed with seemingly objective discussions of politics tactics or weapons dollars and casualties. this is the language of sterility. how casually retrieve casualties in the context of this topic this is where we conceived of rape and casualties as in other abilities. 80% of refugees around the world are women and children. 90% of Modern War casualties are civilian 75% of them are women and children how interesting I'll have a million women in Rwanda gets raped in 100 days or as we speak now hundreds of thousands of Congolese women are getting raped and mutilated how interesting they just become numbers that we referred to. the front of Lords is increasingly non-human eyes peering down on our perceived enemies from space guided missiles toward unseen targets while the human conductor Orchestra of media relations in the event that this particular drone attacks hit a villager instead of an extremist. it is a chess game you learn to play in international relations school on your way out and up to National and International Leadership checkmate. we are missing a completely other side of force we are missing my mother story who make sure with everything with every right with every cut off of electricity she played puppet shows from my brothers and I so we would not be scared of the sounds of explosions. we're missing the story of Frida a music teacher a piano teacher in Sarajevo who made sure that she kept the music school open every single day in the four years of besiege insatiable. and walked to that school despite the sniper shooting at that school and at her and kept the piano the violin the cello playing the whole duration of the war with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats that was her fight that was her resistance. we are missing the story of Nehemiah a Palestinian woman in Gaza who the men are there with the ceasefire last in the last year's worst you've left out of her collected all the flowers and buy as much bread for every neighbor to have in case there is no ceasefire the day after. we are missing the stories of Violetta despite surviving of a genocide in the church Massacre she kept on going on burying bodies Building Homes cleaning the street we are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the metaphors do you know. do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school. I got the factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life going. and the ones who are keeping that life are women. they are two sides of War. this is a site that fight and there is a side that keeps the schools in the factories in the hospital's open there's a side that it's focused on winning battles and there is a side that is focused on winning life. there is a side that leads the Frontline discussion and there is a side that leads the back line discussion. the side the things that piece is the end of fighting. and there is a side that things that pees is the arrival of schools and jobs. there is a side that is led by men. and there is a side that is led by women. and in order for us to understand how do we actually build lasting peace we must understand War and Peace from both sides we must have a picture of what that means. in order for us to understand what actually peace means we need to understand as once or the needs woman wants told me. is my is a fact that my toenails are growing back again. she grew up in Sudan and southern Sudan for 20 years of war what does 1 million people and displaced five million refugees. many women were taken as slaves by rebels and soldiers as sexual slaves to 4/4 also to carry the ammunition in the water and the food for the soldiers so that woman for 20 years so she would not be kidnapped again. and only one there was some sort of Peace her toenails grow back again. we need to understand piece for my toenails perspective. we need to understand that we cannot actually have negotiations are ending of force or peace without fully including women at the negotiating table I find it amazing that the only group of people who I'm not fighting and not killing and not that edging and not burning and not raping and the group of people who are mostly do not exclusively but keeping life going in the midst of War are not included in the negotiating table. and you argued that women leave the backline discussion but they're also men who are excluded from that discussion the doctors who are not fighting the artist that students the man who refused to pick up the guns they are to excluded from the negotiating table. there is no way we can talk about a lasting peace building of democracy sustainable economies any kind of stability if we do not fully include women at the negotiating table not one but 50%. there's no way we can talk about the building of stability if we we don't start investing in women and girls did you know that the one year of the world's military spending equals 700 years of the UN budget and equals 2928 years of us budget allocated for women. if we just reverse that distribution of funds perhaps perhaps we could have a better lasting peace in this world. unlock but not least we need to invest in peace not only because an in women not only because it is the right thing to do not only because it is the right thing to do for all of us to build sustainable and Lasting peace today but it is for the future. a Congolese woman who was telling me about how her children so their father killed in front of them. and so her right in front of him and utilize it in front of them and their children so their nine-year-old sibling killed in front of them. how they're doing okay right now she got into women for women international program she got a support network she learned about her right she we taught her vocation business skills we helped her get a job she was earning $450 she was doing okay she sending them to school having you home. she said but what I worry about the most if not any of that I worry that my children have hate in their heart. and then they want to grow up they want to fight again the killers of their father and their brother. we need to invest in women cause that's our only chance to ensure that there is no more war in the future that mother has a better chance to heal our children than any peace agreement can do. are they good news of course they are good news a lot of good news to start with these women that I told you about our dancing and singing every single day and if they can who are we not today. that girl that I told you about and it's upsetting will metformin International group that impacted 1 million people send 80 million dollars and I thought of this from zero nothing now..they are women who are standing on their feet in spite of their circumstances not because of it I think of how the world can be a much better place if for a change we have a better equality we have a quality we have a representation and we understand were both from the front line and the back line discussion. roomy as 13th century Sufi poet says beyond the roles of fright doings around doing there is a field I will meet you there. when the soul lies down in that grass the world is too full to talk about. ideas language even the phrase each other no longer makes any sense. I humbly ask. humbly ask that out beyond the worlds of War and Peace there is a field and there are many women and men are meeting there let us make this field a much bigger place let us all meet in that field thank you.I'm doing the great attraction magazine I work as a photographer I also have been curating I do anything and everything related to photography that I can. She is a fine art and culture Journal we know so many creative people and we wanted to sort of give people for him to do projects that they might not be able to do for other magazines my Blackberry works with my lifestyle because I actually work for my phone going back and forth with different clients constantly if we're planning an issue of the magazine I'm looking at proofs on my phone the new one has a a keypad and then also a touchscreen I really like the keypad I could not write long emails on a phone that just have a touch screen there's no way. I started taking pictures seriously when I was about Seventeen but I just didn't think it was going to be my job up until very recently all of my personal work with pictures of just like what was around me phone and sitting right with friends I usually have my camera to take a picture but I see Connie. the quality of the camera on the BlackBerry is definitely good enough that I can do almost anything I want online with him I contribute to a couple different blogs aside from the dossier bought a lot of pictures from wherever I am taking with my Blackberry this is rainbow eucalyptus and now he and I did it grows by the side of the road who taken from the top of the pompidou in Paris it's the line to get in does a hedgehog in the souk America the inside of my dog's mouth I just travel a lot for work you know I have my phone with me everywhere I go Works anywhere in the world and that's awesome,0.6705728769302368
PeterReinhart_2008P,and love for the flavor and ultimately the challenge of the baker the challenge of every culinary student of every chef is to deliver flavor  flavor is king flavor rules i call it the flavor rule flavor rules and and you can get somebody to eat something that's good for them once but they won 't eat it again if they don't like it right so this is the challenge for this bread we're going to try this at lunch and i'll explain a bit more about it but it's made not only with two types of pre doughs this attempt again at bringing out flavor is to make a piece of dough the day before this is a wheat bread a whole wheat bread and it's made with a new technique that i've been playing around with and developing and writing about which for lack of a better name we call the epoxy method and i call it an epoxy method because it's not very appetizing i understand that but that is not leavened it's just dough that is wet it's hydrated dough we call the soaker that helps to start enzyme activity and enzymes are the secret kind of ingredient in dough that brings out flavor it starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch that's what enzymes are doing and so if we can release some of those they become accessible to us in our palate they become accessible to the yeast as food they become accessible to the oven for caramelization to give us a beautiful crust the other pre dough that we make is fermented our pre ferment and it's made it can be a sourdough starter or what we call a biga or any other kind of with a little yeast in it and that starts to develop flavor also and on day two we put those two pieces together that's the epoxy  and we're hoping that sort of the enzyme piece of dough becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough and when we put them together and add the final ingredients we can create a bread that does evoke the full potential of flavor trapped in the that's the challenge okay so now what we in the journey of wheat let 's go back and look at these twelve stages i'm going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them okay we're going to start with the first stage  which is just a french way of saying get organized everything in its place first stage so in baking we call it scaling weighing out the ingredients stage two is mixing we take the ingredients and we mix them we have to develop the gluten there's no gluten in flour there's only the potential for gluten here 's another kind of prefiguring of epoxy because we've got glutenin and  neither of which are strong enough to make a good bread but when they get hydrated and they bond to each other they create a stronger molecule a stronger protein we call gluten and so we in the mixing process have to develop the gluten we have to activate the leaven or the yeast and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly but if you think about epoxy what's epoxy it's two resins that are sort of in and of themselves neither of which can make glue but when you put the two together something happens a bond takes place and you get this very strong powerful  and there's a short rest period it can be for a few seconds it can be for twenty or thirty minutes we call that resting or benching then we go into final shaping  and then stage nine the fermentation which started at stage three is continuing through all these other stages again developing more flavor the final fermentation takes place in stage nine we call  the sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust they give us that beautiful brown crust only the crust can caramelize it's the only place that gets hot enough inside the proteins this gluten and gelatinization is yet another oven transformation coagulation caramelization and gelatinization when the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that's around them they they kind of swell and then they burst and they burst and they spill their guts into the bread so basically now we're eating yeast sweats sweat burps and starch guts  again transformed in stage ten in the oven because what went into the oven as dough comes out in stage eleven as bread and stage eleven we call it cooling because we never really eat the bread right away there's a little carry over baking the proteins have to set up strengthen and firm up and then we have stage twelve which the textbooks call packaging but my students call eating and so we're going to be on our own journey today from wheat to eat and in a few minutes we will try this and see if we have succeeded in  adhesive well in this technique what i've tried to do is kind of gather all of the knowledge that the bread baking world the artisan bread baking community has been trying to accumulate over the last twenty years or so since we've been engaged in a bread renaissance in america and put it together to come up with it's hard to get to those levels unless you go through the literal in fact dante says you can't understand the three deeper levels unless you first understand the literal level so that's why we're talking literally about bread but let 's kind of look at these stages again from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level all in my quest for answering the question what is it about bread that's so special and fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor because what happens is bread begins as wheat or any other grain but what's wheat wheat is a grass that grows in the field and like all grasses at a certain point it puts out seeds and we harvest those seeds and those are the wheat kernels now in order to harvest it i mean what's harvesting it's just a euphemism for  killing right i mean that's what's harvest we say we harvest the pig you know yes we slaughter you know yes that's life we harvest the wheat in harvesting it we kill it now wheat is alive and as we harvest it it gives up its seeds now at least with seeds we have the potential for future life we can plant those in the ground and we save some of those for the next generation but most of those seeds get crushed and turned into flour and at that point the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity it's not only been killed but it's been denied any potential for creating future life so as i said i think bread is a transformational food the first transformation and by the way the definition of transformation for me is a radical change from one thing into something else  radical not subtle not like hot water made cold or cold water turned hot but water boiled off and becoming steam that's a transformation two different things well in this case the first transformation is call that radical  so we've got now this clay it's like clay and we infuse that clay with an ingredient that we call leaven in this case it's yeast but yeast is leaven what does leaven  leaven comes from the root word that means enliven to vivify to bring to life a method that would help to take whole grain breads and let 's face it everyone 's trying to move towards whole grains we finally after forty years of knowing that wholegrain was a you see the baker in this moment has become in a sense sort of the god of his dough you know and his dough well while it's not an intelligent life form is now alive and we know it's alive because in stage three it grows growth is the proof of life and while it's growing all these literal transformations are taking place enzymes are breaking forth sugars yeast is eating sugar and turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol bacteria is in there eating the same sugars turning them into acids in other words personality and character 's being developed in this dough under the watchful gaze of the baker  and the baker 's choices all along the way determine the outcome of the product a subtle change in temperature a subtle change in time it's all about a balancing act between time temperature and ingredients that's the art of baking so all these things are determined by the baker and the bread goes through some stages and characters develop and then we divide it and this one big piece of dough is divided into smaller units and each of those units are given shape by the baker and as they're shaped they're raised again all along proving that they're alive and developing character  and at stage ten we take it to the oven it's still dough nobody eats bread dough a few people do i think but not too many i've met some dough eaters but  it's not the staff of life right bread is the staff of life but dough is what we're working with and we take that dough to the oven and it goes into the oven as soon as the interior temperature of that dough crosses the threshold of one hundred and forty degrees it passes what we call the thermal death point students love that tdp they think it's the name of a video game  but it's the thermal death point all life ceases there the yeast whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough to enliven it to vivify it in order to complete its mission which is also to turn this dough into bread what goes in is dough what comes out is bread or it goes in alive comes out dead  third transformation first transformation alive to dead second transformation dead brought back to life third transformation alive to dead but dough to bread or another analogy would be a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly and it's what comes out of the oven that is what we call the staff of life this is the product that you know we have a chance to essentially ingest that it nurtures us and we continue to carry on and have opportunities to ponder things like this so this is what i've learned from bread this is what bread has taught me in my journey and what we're going to attempt to do with this bread here again is to use in addition to everything we talked about this bread we're going to call spent grain bread because as you know bread making is very similar to beer making beer is basically liquid bread or bread is solid beer you know how do you make it taste good because whole grain it's easy with white flour to make a good tasting bread white flour is sweet it's mainly starch and starch when you break it down what is starch it turned into bread but we've got this bread and what i did here is to try to again evoke even more flavor from this was we've added into it the spent grain from beer making and if you make this bread you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer i like dark spent grain today we're using a light spent grain that's actually from like some kind of a lager of some sort a light lager or an ale that is wheat and barley that's been toasted in other words the beer maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains by using sprouting and malting and roasting we're going to take some of that and put it into the bread so now we not only have a high fiber bread but now fiber on top of fiber  and so this is again hopefully not only a healthy bread i kind of break this bread maybe we can share this now a little bit here we'll start a little piece here and i'm going to take a little piece here i think i'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch i'll leave you with what i call the baker 's blessing may your and your bread always rise thank you  thank you sugar yes so a baker and a good baker knows how to pull or draw forth the inherent sugar trapped in the starch with whole grain bread you have other obstacles you've got bran which is ,this is a wheat bread a whole wheat bread and it's made with a new technique that I've been playing around with in developing and writing about which for lack of a better name we called the epoxy method and I called an epoxy not very appetizing I understand that but. but do you think about a posse with epoxy it's it's two residents that are sort of in and of themselves neither which can make glue but when you put the two together something happens to bond takes place and you get this very strong powerful adhesive well in this technique what I tried to do is kind of gather all of the knowledge that they bread baking world the artisan bread baking Community has been trying to accumulate over the last twenty years or so since we've been engaged in a bread Renaissance in America and put it together to come up with a method that would help to take whole grain Breads and let's face it everyone's trying to move towards Pol granch we finally after forty years of knowing that whole draeden was a healthier option we're finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over and attempting to actually eat them the challenge do for a whole grain Baker is you know how do you make it taste good too because the whole Greiner it is easy with white flour to make a good tasting bread white flower is sweet. it's mainly starch and starch when you break it down what is starch it's thank you sugar yes so a baker and a good Baker knows how to pull or Draw forth the inherent sugar trapped in the starch brand which is the healthiest part of the bread for us and the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber for the brand is is fiber Scott germ those are the good thing those aren't the tastiest part of the week so I'll bring breads historically have had sort of this onus of being Health Food Breads and people don't like to eat quote help with a lot of healthy and help the leaks but when we think of something at the hell could we we think of it as something we eat out of obligation not out of passion and love for the flavor and ultimately the challenge of the the baker the challenge of every culinary student of every Chef is to deliver flavor flavor is King flavor rules I call it the flavor roll flavor rules and and you. can get somebody to eat something that's good for them once but they won't eat it again if they don't like it right so this is the challenge for this bread we're going to try this at lunch and and I'll explain a little bit more about it but it's me not only with two types of predosa this attempt against at bringing out flavors to make a piece of do the day before that is not leavened it's just do that is wet it's it's hydrated do we call the Soaker that helps to start enzyme activity and enzymes are the secret kind of ingredient in joke that brings out flavor it starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch that's what enzymes are going and so we can release some of those they become accessible to us and our pallet they become accessible to the yeast as food they become accessible to the oven for caramelization to give us a beautiful crust the other predo that we make is fermented a pre Forum in and it's made it can be a sourdough starter or what we call a b got or any other kind of free for men to do with a little yeast in it and that starts with a. flavor also I don't day too we put those two pieces together. The epoxy and we're hoping that sort of thief is the enzyme piece of dough becomes the fuelpak for the 11-piece of do I'm going to be put them together and have the final ingredient we can create a bread that does evoke the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain that's the challenge of week I can look at these 12 stages when I go to them very quickly and then revisit them okay we're going to start with the first stage and this is this is what every student have to be in with everyone who worked in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is mise en place which is just say French way of saying get organized everything in its place first date so we call it the scaling weighing out the ingredients is mixing we take the ingredients and we mix and we have to develop the gluten does no gluten in flour there's only the potential for gluten there's another kind of prefiguring of epoch. then neither of which are strong enough to make a good bread but when they get hydrated and they bond to each other they create a stronger molecule is stronger protein we called gluten and so we in the mixing process have to develop the gluten we have to activate the 11 or the yeast have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly in the third stage which is really where the flavor develops the yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars craving carbon dioxide and alcohol essentially it's burping and sweating which is what bread is its youth sweats and somehow this is transformed this person sweats or later transform and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transformational food and we're going to explore that quickly through the next two stages we after its fermented and it's developed started to develop flavor and character we divided into smaller units and then we take those units and we shape them we give him a little priest. usually around or a little torpedo-shaped sometimes that's called rounding and then there's a short rest. It can be for a few seconds I can be for 20 or 30 minutes we call that resting or benching then we go into final shaping. panning which means putting the shape loaf on a pan just takes a second but it's a distinctive stage it could be in a basket it can be on a loaf pan but we plan it and then stage 9 the fermentation which started at stage three is continuing through all these other stages again developing more flavor the final fermentation take place in stage 9 we call it proofing proofing mean to prove that the door was alive and it saves nine we get the dough to the final shape and it goes into the oven stage 10 free Transformations take place in the oven the sugars in the dough caramelize in the press to give us that beautiful brown crust only the crust in caramelized the only place that gets hot enough inside the proteins this gluten coagulates when he gets to about 160° the proteins all line up and they create structure the gluten structure But ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread and the starch is when they reach about 180° gelatin eyes. and gelatinization is yet another oven transformation coagulation the caramelization and gelatinization when the starch is thick and they absorb all the swell and then they burst and they first they spilled their guts into the into the bread so basically now we're eating yeast sweats sweat burps and starts guts again transformed and Stage 10 in the oven because what went into the oven as though comes out in stage 11 as bread and Stage 11 we called cooling cuz he never really eat the bread right away there's a little carryover baking the proteins have to set up strengthen and firm up. and then we have stage 12 which the textbooks call packaging but my students called eating and so we're going to be on our own Journey today from we to eat and and in a few minutes we will try this again and see if we have succeeded in fulfilling this Baker's mission of pulling out flavor but I want to go back now and revisit these steps and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation because I really believe that all things can be understood in this not my own idea this goes back to the Scholastic's into the Ancients that all things can be understood on four levels the literal the metaphorical poetic level the political or ethical level and ultimately the mystical sometimes called the anagogical level it's hard to get to those levels and let you go through the literal in fact Dante says you can't understand the three deeper levels unless you first understand the literal level so that's why we're talkin literally about bread it looks kind of look at these stages again from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper. all in my quest for answering the question what is it about bread that's so special and fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor wheat or any other grain wheat is a grass that grows in the field and like all grasses and a certain point of puts out seeds. and we Harvest those seeds and those are the wheat kernels now in order to harvest said I mean what's harvesting it's just a euphemism for killing right that mean slaughtered weekend that's life we harvest the wheat and harvesting it would kill it now we'd isn't is is alive and as we we harvested it gives up its seeds at least we'll see if we have the potential for future life we can plant those in the ground and we save some of those for the next-generation but most of those seeds get crushed and turned into flour and at that point the we have suffered the ultimate indignity is not really been killed but it's been denied any potential for creating future life so we turned it into flour. so as I say by think I'm red as a transformational food the First Transformation and by the way the definition of transformation for me is a radical change from one thing into something else they radical not subtle not like hot water make cold or cold water turned hot but water boiled off. alive the dead I call that radical. so we got now this this flower and what are we do we add some water in stage in stage one we weigh at stage 2 we had water and salt to it mix it together and we create something that we call Clay it's like clay and we Infuse that clay with an ingredient that we call leaven in this case it's yeast but you stood Levin what does leaven mean Levin come from the root word that means enliven to vivify to bring to life. by the way what's the Hebrew word for clay. Adam you see the baker in this moment has become and it sends sort of the god of his do you know this do well while it's not an intelligent life-form we know it's a lie because I'm stage three it grows growth is the proof of life and while it's growing all these literal Transformations are taking place enzymes are breaking forth sugars yeast is eating sugar and and and turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol bacteria is in there eating the same sugars turning them into assets in other words personality and character is being developed in this do under the watchful gaze of the Baker and the Baker's Choice is all along the way to determine the outcome of the product. a subtle change in temperature a subtle change in time it's all about a balancing act between time temperature in the ingredients that's the art of baking so all these things are just determined by the Baker and the bread goes through some stages and characters of men we divide it and this one big piece of dough is divided into smaller units and each of those units are given shape by the Baker and if they're shaped they're raised again all along proving that they're alive and developing character and its stage 10 we take it to the oven it's still do nobody eats bread though if you people do I think but not too many I've met some do eaters but it's not it's not the staff of life right bread is the same what what do with what we're working with Emily take that do to the oven. and goes into the oven as soon as the interior temperature that do crosses the threshold of 140 degrees it passes what we call the thermal death point the TDP of that TDP they think it's the name of a video game but it's the thermal death Point all life ceases there the yeast whose mission it has been up till now to raise the do to enliven it to vivify in order to complete its Mission which is also to turn this do into Bread have to give up its life so you see the symbolism of work is starting to come forth a little bit you know starting to make sense to make.what goes in is do what comes out is bread or it goes in a live comes out dead hair transformation First Transformation alive the dead second transformation dead brought back to life third transformation alive to dead but do to bread or another analogy would be a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly and it's what comes out of the oven that is what we call the staff of life this is the the product that that. everyone in the world eats that is so difficult to give up it's so it's it's so deeply embedded in our psyches then that bread is used as a symbol for life that used as a symbol for transformation. and so as we get to Stage 12 and we partake of that again completing the life cycle you do we have a chance to essentially ingest that nurtures us and we continue to carry on and have opportunities to ponder things like this so this is what I've learned from her this is what bread has taught me in my journey in and what we're going to attempt to do with this bread here again is to use in addition to everything we talked about this bread we're going to call spent grain bread because as you know bread making is very similar beer making that beer is basically liquid bread or bread is solid beer and. eastern fence around the same time I think beer came first and the Egyptian who was tending of your fell asleep in the hot Egyptian sun and it turned into bread but we've got the spread and what what I did here is the traffic again evoke even more flavor from this grain was we've added into it to spend bring from beer-making and if you make the spread you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer I like dark spank rain today we're using a lights been green it's actually from like that yeah I was some kind of a logger of some sort of light lager or an ale that is wheat and barley that's been toasted with the beer maker knows also have to leave oat flavor from the grain by using sprouting in malting and roasting we're going to take some of that and put it into the bread so now we've not only have a high fiber bread but now fiber on top of fiber. and and so this is again hopefully not only a healthy bread for the bread that you will enjoy so I think kind of break this bread maybe we can share this now a little bit here will start a little piece here and I'm going to take a little piece you write that better taste it myself before you have it at lunch I'll leave you. with what I call the baker's blessing may your crust be crisp and your bread always rise thank you,0.6966145634651184
MenaTrott_2006,i'm a blogger which probably to a lot of you means different things you may have heard about the kryptonite lock sort of brouhaha where a blogger talked about how you hack or break into a kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen and it spread all over kryptonite had to adjust the lock and they had to address it to so not typesetted on a old typewriter it's on word so bloggers exposed this or they worked hard to expose this you know blogs are scary this is what you see i see this and i'm sure scared and i swear on stage shitless about blogs because this is not something that's friendly but there are blogs that  changing the way we read news and consume media and you know these are great examples these people are reaching thousands if not millions of readers and that's incredibly important you know we had during the hurricane you have msnbc posting about the hurricane on their blog updating it frequently this was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools you know you have my friend who has a blog on digital on pdrs personal recorders he makes enough money just by running ads to support his family up in oregon that's all he does now and this is something that blogs has made possible and then you have something like this which is interplast it's a wonderful organization of people and doctors who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery to those who need it so children with cleft palates they will get it and they document their story this is wonderful i am not caring that's what i am i'm a blogger i i wasn't happy with my job because i was a designer but i wasn't being really stimulated i was an english major in college i didn't have any use for it but i missed writing so i started to write a blog and i started to create things like these little stories and this was an illustration about my camp experience when i was eleven years old and how i went to a ymca camp christian camp and basically by the end i had made my friends hate me so much that i hid in a bunk they couldn't find me they sent a search party and i overheard people saying they wish i had killed myself jumped off bible peak so you can laugh this is ok this is who makes this is me this is what happened to me and when i started my blog it was really this one goal i wanted i realized i said you know i am not going to be famous to the world but i could be famous to people on the internet and i set a goal i said i'm going to win an award because i had never won an award in my entire life and i said i'm going to win this award the south by southwest weblog award and i reached all of these people and i had tens of thousands of people reading about my life everyday and then i wrote a post about a banjo i wrote a post about wanting to buy a banjo a three hundred dollar banjo which is a lot of money and i don't play instruments i don't know anything about music i like music and i and i think i probably heard steve martin playing and i said i could do that and i said i said to my husband i said ben can i buy a banjo and he 's like no and my he told me you cannot buy a banjo this is you're just like your dad who buys who collects instruments and i wrote a post about how i was so mad at him he was such a tyrant he would not let me buy this banjo and for those people who know me understood my joke this is mena this is how i make a joke at people because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog if he knew i was showing this right now i put this in today he would kill me but the thing was i wrote this and my friends read it and they're like oh that mena she wrote a post about you know wanting a stupid thing and being stupid  but i got emails from people that said oh my god your husband is such an asshole how much money does he spend on beer in a year more nerve wracking but then i started thinking about my family i started thinking about my father and my grandfather and my great grandfather and i realized that ok what who are these people and why are they reading this and i realized i don't want to reach these people i don't want to write for this public audience and i started to kill my blog slowly i'm like i don't want to write this anymore and i slowly and slowly and i did tell personal stories from time to then i wrote this one and i put this up because of einstein today  personal that interests me and this is you know this is who who i am you know you see norman rockwell and you have art critics say you know norman rockwell is not art norman rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms and this is not  something to be considered high art and i think this is like one of the most important things to us as you know humans  these things resonate to us and you know if you think about blogs you think of high art blogs the history paintings about you know all biblical stories and then you have this these are the blogs that interest me the people that just tell stories and one story is about this baby and his name is odin and his father was a blogger and he was writing his blog one day and his wife gave birth to her baby twenty five at twenty five weeks and he never expected this one day it was normal one day then the next day it was hell all of these teds going through my blood  and this is a one pound baby and so odin was documented every single day pictures were taken every day day one day two you know you have day nine they're talking about his apnea thirty nine he gets pneumonia this his baby is so small and i've never encountered such a just he 's having failures breathing failures and heart failures and it's slowing down and you don't know what to expect but then it gets better you know day ninety six he goes home you see this post that's not something that you're going to see in a paper or a magazine but this is something that this person feels and people are excited about it you know twenty eight comments that's not a huge amount of people reading but twenty eight people matter i had to be consider this my element so and today he is a healthy baby who you know if you read his blog it's snowdeal org his father 's blog he so blogs you know so what you've probably heard these thing before we talked about the well and we talked about all these sort of things throughout our online history but i think blogs are basically just an evolution and that's where we are today it's this record of who you are your persona you have your google search where you say hey what is mena trott and then you find these things and you're happy or unhappy but then you also find people 's blogs and those are the records of people that are writing daily not necessarily about the same topic but things that interest to them we talk about the world flattens as being this panel and i am very optimistic whenever i think about blogs i'm like oh we've got to reach all these people millions and hundreds of millions and billions of people the life record of a blog is something that i find incredibly important and we started with a slide of my  but you know this is basically the extent of the family that i know in terms of my direct line and i showed a norman rockwell painting before and this one i grew up with looking at constantly i would spend hours looking at just the connections saying oh the little kid at the top has red hair so does that first generation up there and just these little things you know this is not science but this was enough for me to be really so interested about how we have evolved and how we can trace our line  this is all i have i have a couple of facts about somebody i have their date of birth and their age and what they did in their household if they spoke english and that's it that's all i know of these people which i really was appalled by and because i wanted to impress and it's pretty sad because how i only go back five generations and then it's it i don't even know what happens on my mom 's side because she's from cuba and i don't have that many things this is my great great grandmother this is the only picture i have and to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs photo that has greatly influenced me or a series of photos is this project that's done by an argentinean man or his and his wife and he 's basically taking a picture of his family every day for the past what is seventy six twenty oh my god i'm seventy seven twenty nine years twenty nine years a joke originally about my graph that i left out is that you see all this math i'm just happy i was able to add it up to one hundred because that's my skill set you all with slides since i saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs i made a graph that moves so this you have you have these people aging and now this is them today or last year a powerful thing to have to be able to track this i wish that i would have this of my family i know that one day my children will be wondering or my grandchildren or my great grandchildren if i ever have children what i am going to who i was and so i do something that's very narcissistic i am a blogger that is an amazing thing for me because it captures a moment in time every day i take a picture of myself i've been doing this since last year and i talk about the makeup of me because there are bad pictures not to be there and so you see these things it's not just always smiling now i've kind of evolved it so i have this look if you look at my driver 's license i have the same look and it's it's a pretty  so this woman her name was emma and she was a blogger on our service typepad and she was a beta tester so she was there right when we opened you know there was one hundred people and she wrote about her life dealing with cancer and she was writing and writing and writing and we all started reading it because we had so few blogs on the service we could keep track of everyone and she was writing one day and you know then she disappeared for a little bit so so besides this freakish thing this is my science slide so this is math and this is science this is genetics this is my grandmother and her sister came on and she said that that emma had passed away and all of our support staff who had talked to her were were really emotional and it was a very hard day at the company and it was this was one of those instances where i realized how much blogging affects our relationship and flattening this sort of world that this woman is in england and she lives she lived a life where she was talking about her what she was doing but the big thing that really influenced us was her sister wrote to me and she said you know and she wrote on this blog that writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing that had happened to her and being able to talk to people being able to share what was going on and being able to write and receive comments and that was amazing to be able to know that we had empowered that and that  blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing and that the idea that blogging doesn't have to be scary that we don't always have to be attack of the blogs that we can be people who are open and wanting to help and talk to people that was an amazing thing and and this is where i get this mouth and so i printed out her or i sent a pdf of her blog to her family and they passed it out at her memorial service and even in her her obituary they mentioned her blog because it was such a big part of her life and that's a huge thing  so that's this is her legacy and i think that my call to action to all of you is you know think about blogs think about what they are think about what you've thought of them you know and then  actually do it because it's something that is really going to change our lives so thank you ,"open past couple days I've been preparing for my speech I've become more and more nervous about what I'm going to say in about being on the stage the same stages all these Fascinating People be on the same stage as I'll go with the first person that ever voted for and. I'm getting pretty nervous and you know I didn't know that Chris is on the stage and that's the more nerve-wracking but then I started thinking about my family I started thinking about my father and my grandfather and my great-grandfather and I realized that I had all of these Ted's going through my bloodstream. that I had to be considered this my element so so who am I so Chris kind of mention I started a company with my husband we have that 125 people internationally, she looked in the book you saw this which I really was appalled by. and because I wanted to impress you all with slide since I saw the great presentation yesterday with grass I made a graph that moves and I talked about the makeup of May. besides his freakish thing this is my science light so this is math and the Sciences genetics this is my grandmother and this is where I get this mouth. I'm a blogger which probably to lot of you means different things you may have heard about the Kryptonite Lock I'm sort of brew HaHa where a blogger talked about how you hack or break into a Kryptonite Lock using a ballpoint pen and it's spread all over. Had to adjust a lock and they had to dress it to avoid tuna customer concerns you may have heard about rather date which was basically the result of vloggers realizing that the th in 111 is not types headed on a old typewriter it's onward so bloggers expose this or they worked hard to explode expose this you know blogs or scary this is what you see I see this and I'm scared and I swear on stage shit less about blogs because this is not something that's friendly but there are blocks that are changing the way we read news and consume media any of these are great examples of these people are reaching thousands if not millions of readers and that's it. important you know we have during the hurricane you have MSNBC posting about the hurricane on their blog updating it frequently this was possible because of the easy nature of logging tools you know you have my friend who has a Blog on some digital or pvr's personal recorders he makes enough money just by running ads to support his family up in Oregon that's all he does now and this is something that's logs as possible and then you have something like this which is interplast It's a Wonderful organization of people in doctors who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery to those who need it so children with cleft palates they will get it in a document their story this is wonderful I am not that caring. I talk about myself that's what I am I'm a blogger I have always decided that I was going to be an expert on one thing and I am an expert on this person and so I write about it and so the short story about my blog is started in 2001 I was 23 I wasn't happy with my job because I was a designer but I wasn't being really stimulated I was an English major in college I didn't have any use for it but I miss riding so I started to write a blog and I started to create things like these little stories and this was an illustration about my Camp experience when I was 11 years old and how I went to the YMCA Camp Christian Camp and basically by the end I had made my friends hate me so much that I hid in a bunk they couldn't find me to send a search party and I overheard people saying they wish I had killed myself jumped off Bible Peak so this is okay. this is who makes this is this is me this is what happened to me and when I started my blog it was really this one goal I wanted I realize I said you know I am not going to be famous to the world but I can be famous to people on the internet and I said a goal I said I'm going to win an award because I never won an award in my entire life I said I'm going to win this for the sxsw weblog award I reached all of these people and I had tens of thousands people reading about my life every day and then I wrote a post about a banjo I wrote a post about wanting to buy a banjo a $300 banjo which is a lot of money and I don't play instruments I don't know anything about music I like music and I like them and I think I'm playing and I said that I could do that and I said I said to my husband I said then can I buy a banjo and he's like no and my husband. this is my husband who is very hot he won an award for being hot. he told me you cannot buy banjo this is you just like your dad. Who collects instruments and I wrote a post about how I was so mad at him he was such a tyrant would not let me buy this banjo and for those people who know me understood my joke this is me this is how I make a joke at people because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant this person still loving so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog and. and if he knew I was showing this right now today you would kill me but the thing was I wrote this in the pie friends read it and I like all that mean either she wrote a post about females wanting a stupid thing is being stupid but I got emails from people that said oh my God your husband is such an asshole how much money did they spend on beer in a year you could take that money and buy your banjo why don't you open a separate I've been with him since I was 17 years old never had a separate bank account at your bank account spend your money spend his money that's it and I leave him and. and I was like okay what who are these people and why are they reading this and I realize I don't want to reach these people I don't want to write for this public audience and I started to kill my blog slowly on my I don't want to write this anymore and I slowly slowly and I can a personal stories from time then. I wrote this when I put this up because of Einstein today and I'm going to get choked up because this is my first pet and she passed away two years ago and I decided to break from my don't really ride about my public life because I wanted to give her a little Memorial but anyways. personal stories do you read the blogs about politics or about media and and gossip and all these things these are out there but it's more of the personal that interest me and this is you know this who's who who who I am and you see Norman Rockwell and you have art critics say living rooms and bathrooms and this is not something to be considered high art and I think this is like one of the most important things to us as you know humans these things resonate to us and the high art blogs with history paintings about you know all biblical stories and then you have this these are what these are the blocks that interest me the people that just tell stories and one story is about this baby and his name is Odin and his father was a blogger and he was writing his blog one day and his wife gave birth to her baby 20 at 25 weeks. and he never expected this one day it was normal one day then the next day it was hell and it this is a 1 pound baby and so Odin was documented every single day pictures were taken every day date one day to you know you have Dana and they're talking about his apnea stay 39 he gets pneumonia this is baby is so small and I've never encountered such just disturbing image but just just so heartfelt and you're reading this as this happen so on de55 everybody reads that he has on his having failures and breathing failures and heart failures and slowing down and you don't know what to expect but then it gets better and you know de 96 he goes home and you see this post that's not something that you're going to see in the paper or a magazine but this is something that this person feels and people are excited about it you'll 28 comments that's not a huge amount of people reading but 28 people matter and today he is a healthy baby who. read his blog it's no deal. Org his father's blood he is taking pictures of him still because he is still his son and he is I think at his age level right now because he had been such great treatments in the hospital so so what you probably heard these things before we talked about the well and we talked about all of these sort of things throughout our online history but I think blondes are basically just an evolution and that's where we are today it's this record of who you are your persona you have your Google search will you say hey what does it mean to trot and then you find these things you're happy or unhappy but then you also find people's blogs and those are the reference of people that are riding daily not necessarily about the same topic but seeing things that interest to them and. you would talk about the world flat into seeing this panel and I am very optimistic whenever I think about Blossom like a we got to reach all these people millions and hundreds of millions and billions of people and we're getting it to try to be there but you know there's so many people that won't have the access to write a blog but to see something like $200 computer is amazing because it's a blogging software simple and we have a successful company because of timing and because of perseverance but it's simple stuff it's not rocket science and so that's an amazing thing to consider. soap. the life record of a Blog is something that I find incredibly important and we started with a flight of my kids and I had to add this slide because I knew the minute I showed this my mom my mom will see the back somehow because she does read my blog and she'll say why wouldn't a picture of me this is my mom so I have all of the people that I know of but this is basically the extent of the family that I know in terms of my just direct line and I should have known her before and this one I grew up with looking at constantly I would spend hours looking at just a connection saying all the little cap on the top has red hair so does that first generation up there and just eat little things you know this is not. this is not science but this is enough for me to be really so interested about how we have evolved and how we are to face our line and so that is always influenced me his record this this 1910 census of another Grabowski when that's my maiden name and others of Theodore because there's always a Theodore this is all I have I have a couple facts about somebody I have their date of birth and their age and what they did in their household if they spoke English and that's it that's all I know of these people and it's pretty sad because how I only go back five generations and then it said I don't even know what happened to my mom's side because she's from Cuba and I don't have that many things. and just doing if I spent time in the archives that's why I another thing why my husband the saint I spent time in the Washington archives just sitting there looking for these things now it's online but he sat through that and so you have this record and you know this is my great-great-grandmother this is the only picture I have and to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs to think about the people that are on those hundred-dollar computer talking about who they are sharing these personal stories this is an amazing thing another photo that is greatly influenced me or a series of photos is this project that's done by an Argentinian man or is he and his wife and he's basically taking a picture of his family every day for the past when is 76200 my God I'm seventy-seven 29 years. there's joke original about my grass I left out is that you see all this math I'm just happy I was able to add it up to a hundred because that's my skillset. so this you have you have these people aging and now this is them today or yes or last year and that's a powerful thing to have to be able to track this I wish that I would it have this of my family I know that one day my children will be wondering or my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren if I ever have children what I am going to who I was and so I do something it's very narcissistic I'm a blogger that is an amazing thing for me because it captures the moment on time every day I take a picture of myself I've been doing this since last year of myself every single day and you know it's the same picture it's basically the same person only a couple people read it I don't write this for this audience I'm showing it now but I would go if this was really public about four people probably read it and they they tell me you haven't updated I'm trying to get people selling I haven't updated but this is something that's amazing because I can go back to a day I can go back to April 2000. five and say what was I doing this day I look at it I know exactly it's his visual cue that is so important to what we do and I put the pictures up to it because there are bad picture. and I remember instantly I am inside and Germany in this I have to go for a one-day trip I was sick and I was in a hotel room and I wanted not to be there and so you see these things it's not always smiling now I kind of all that so I have my driver's license I have the same look and it's it's it's a pretty disturbing thing but it's something that is really important and. last story I really want to tell is this story because this is probably the one that the means the most to me and all of what I'm doing after I get choked up because I tend to when I talk about this so This Woman her name is Emma and she was a blogger on our service iPad and she was a beta tester so she was there right when we open to know there's 100 people and she wrote about her life dealing with cancer and she was riding and riding and riding and we all started reading it because we had so few laws on the service we could keep track of everyone and she was writing one day and you know she then she disappeared for a little bit and her sister came on and she said that Emma had passed away and all of our support staff who had talked to her or we're really emotional and it was a very hard day at the company and it wasn't this was one of those incidents where I realized how much blogging affects our relationship and flattening the sort of world that this woman is in England and she lives. she lived a life where she was talking about her what she was doing but the big thing that really influenced us was her sister wrote to me and she said you know and she wrote on this blog that writing her blog during the last couple months of her life was probably the best thing that has happened to her and being able to talk to people being able to share what was going on and being able to write comments and that was to be able to know that we had empowered that and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing and that the idea that logging doesn't have to be scary that we don't always have to be at a couple blocks that we can feed people who are open and wanting to help and talk to people that was an amazing thing and and so I print it out her or I send a PDF of her blog to her family and I passed it on her memorial service and even in her her obituary to mention her blog because it was such a big part of her life and and that's a huge thing so that's this is her Legacy and I think that my call to action to all of. is think about blogs think about what they are think about what you thought of them heal and then actually do it because it's something that is really going to change our lives so thank you",0.80078125
PatrickAwuah_2007G, with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent we have reached a moment  it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders will make all the difference thank you he 's praying pitch black not a candle  and that hospital could have afforded flashlights they could have afforded to purchase these things but they didn 't and it happened twice another time she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die because they refused to give her oxygen that they had and so three months later just before she returned to the united states nurses in accra go on strike and her like many of you here i am trying to contribute towards a renaissance in africa the question of transformation in africa really is a question of leadership africa can only be transformed you see the faults of the ministry of health the hospital administrators the doctors the nurses they are among just five percent of their peers who get an education after secondary school they are the elite they are our leaders their decisions their actions matter and when they fail a nation literally suffers so when i speak of leadership i'm not talking about just political leaders we've heard a lot about that i'm talking about the elite those who 've been trained whose job it is to be the guardians of their society the lawyers the judges the policemen the doctors the engineers the civil  those are the leaders and we need to train them right now my first pointed and memorable and one day i go to the airport to meet my father and as i walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building i'm stopped by two soldiers wielding ak forty seven assault weapons and they asked me to join a crowd of people that were running up and down this embankment why because the path i had taken was considered out of bounds no sign to this now i was sixteen i was very worried about what my peers at school might think if they saw me running up and down this hill i was especially concerned of what the girls might think and so i started to argue with these men it was a little reckless but you know i was sixteen i got lucky a ghana airways pilot falls into the same predicament because of his uniform they speak to him differently and they explain to him that they're just following orders so he takes their radio talks to their boss and gets us all released by enlightened leaders and it is my contention that the manner in which we educate our leaders is fundamental to progress on this continent what lessons would you take from an experience like this several for me leadership matters those men are following the orders of a superior officer i learned something about courage it was important not to look at those guns and i also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls  so a few years after this event i leave ghana on a scholarship to go to swarthmore college for my education it was a breath of fresh air you know the faculty there didn't want us to memorize information and repeat back to them as i was used to back in ghana they wanted us to think critically they wanted us to be analytical to be concerned about social issues in my economics classes i got high marks for my understanding of basic economics but i learned something more profound than that which is that leaders the managers of ghana 's economy were making breathtakingly bad decisions had brought our economy to the brink of collapse and so here was this lesson again leadership matters it matters a great deal but i didn't really fully understand what had happened to me at swarthmore i had an inkling but i didn't fully realize it until i went out into the workplace and i went to work at microsoft corporation and i was part of this team this thinking learning team whose job it was to design and implement new i want to tell you some stories that explain my view we all heard about the importance of stories yesterday created value in the world and it was brilliant to be part of this team it was brilliant  and i realized just what had happened to me at swarthmore this transformation the ability to confront problems complex problems and to design solutions to those problems the ability to create is the most empowering thing that can happen to an individual and i was part of that while i was at microsoft the annual revenues of that company grew larger than the gdp of the republic of ghana and by the way it's continued to the gap has widened since i left now i've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred i mean it's the people there who are so hardworking  persistent creative empowered but there were also some external factors free markets the rule of law infrastructure these things were provided by institutions run by the people that i call leaders and those leaders did not emerge spontaneously somebody trained them to do the work that they do now while i was at microsoft this funny thing happened i became a parent and for the first time africa mattered more to me than ever before an american friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in ghana and in a period of three months she came because i realized that the state of the african continent would matter to my children and their children that the state of the world the state of the world depends on what's happening to africa as far as my kids  and at this time when i was going through what i call my pre mid life crisis  this was not the world that i'd want my children to grow up in so i decided to get engaged and the first thing that i did was to come back to ghana and talk with a lot of people and really try to understand what the real issues and three things kept coming up for every problem corruption weak institutions and the people who run them the leaders now i was a little scared because when you see those three problems they seem really hard to deal with and they might say look don't even try but for me i asked the question well where are these leaders coming from  what is it about ghana that produces leaders that are unethical to solve problems so i went to look at what was happening in our educational system and it was the same learning by rote from primary school through graduate school very little emphasis on ethics and the average you know the typical graduate from a university in ghana has a stronger sense of entitlement than a sense of responsibility this is wrong so i decided to engage this particular problem  because it seems to me that every society every society must be very intentional about how it trains its leaders and ghana was not paying enough attention and this is true across sub saharan africa  africa i wish there was a liberal arts college in every african country i think it would make huge difference and what ashesi university is trying to do the ability to confront the complex problems ask the right questions and come up with workable solutions i'll admit that there are times when it seems like mission impossible but we must believe that these kids are smart that if we involve them in their education if we the real issues that they confront that our whole society confronts and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world that magic will happen  into this project we'd just started classes and a month into it i come to the office and i have this email from one of our students  and it said very simply i am thinking now and he signs off thank you it's such a simple statement i was moved almost to tears because i understood was happening to this young man and it is an awesome thing to be a part of empowering someone in this way thinking now this year we challenged our students to craft an honor code themselves there's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now  whether they should have an honor code and if so what it should look like one of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart  not a candle pitch black the patient 's cut open twice can we create a perfect society  her understanding that a student crafted honor code constitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible now we cannot achieve perfection but if we reach for it then we can achieve excellence i don't know ultimately what they will do i don't know whether they will decide to have this honor code  but the conversation they're having now about what their good society should look like what their excellent society should look like is a really good thing time  ok now i just want to leave that slide up because it's important that we think about it the first time it was a c section thankfully baby was out mother and child survived i'm very excited about the fact that every student at ashesi university does community service before they graduate that for many of them it has been a life altering experience these young future leaders are beginning to understand the real business of leadership the real privilege of leadership which is after all to serve humanity i am even more thrilled by the fact that least year our student body elected a woman to be the head of student government it's the first time in the history of ghana that a woman has been elected head of student government at any university says a lot about her it says a lot about the culture that's forming on campus it says a lot about her peers who elected her she won with seventy five percent of the vote and it gives me a lot of hope it turns out that corporate west africa also appreciates what's happening with our students we've graduated two classes of students to date and every single one of them has been the second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia  and we're getting great reports back from corporate ghana corporate west africa and the things that they're most impressed about is work ethic you know that passion for what they're doing the persistence their ability to deal with ambiguity their ability to tackle problems that they haven't seen before this is good  because you know  over the past five years there have been times when i've felt this is mission impossible and it's just wonderful to see sort of these glimmers of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right i think that the current and future leaders of africa have an incredible opportunity to drive a major renaissance on the continent ,like many of you here. I am trying to contribute to what the Renaissance in Africa. the question of transformation in Africa really is a question of leadership Africa can only be transformed. buy enlightened leaders and it is my contention that the manner in which we educate our leaders is fundamental to progress on this continent. I want to tell you some stories that explain my few we all heard about the importance of stories yesterday. an American friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in Ghana. and the period of three months she came to a conclusion about the state of leadership in Africa that has taken me over a decade to reach. twice she was involved and surgeries. when you lost power of the hospital. emergency generators did not start. it was not a flashlight not a lantern. how to Candle pitch-black patients cut open. twice. the first time was a C-section. thankfully baby was out mother and child survived. the second time was a procedure that involve local anesthesia. anesthetic wears off patient feels pain he's crying he screaming. spraying. Pitch Black. a candle but a flashlight that hospital could have afforded flashlights that could have afforded to purchase these things but they didn't it happened why another time she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient died because they refused to give her oxygen. They had. I'm so three months later just before she returned to the United States nurses and I cry going to strike and her. her recommendation is to take this opportunity to fire everyone start all over again start all over again. now what does this have to do with leadership. you see the folks at the Ministry of Education of of Health. the hospital administrators the doctors the nurses they are among just 5% of their peers who get an education after secondary school they are the Elite there are leaders their decisions their actions matter and when they fail and Nation literally suffers. so when I speak of leadership I'm not talking about just political leaders we've heard a lot about that I'm talking about the elite those who've been trained whose job it is to be the Guardians of their society the lawyers the judges the policeman the doctor's the engineer's the civil servants those are the leaders and we need to train them right. not my first pointed and memorable experience of leadership in Ghana occurred when I was 16 years old we just had a military coup and soldiers were pervasive in our society their pervasive presence and one day I go to the airport to meet my father and as I walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building. I'm stopped by to soldiers wielding AK-47 assault weapons. and they asked me to join a crowd of people that were running up and down this embankment why because the path I have taken considered out of bounds no signs to this effect. no I was 16. I was very worried about what my peers at school might think if they saw me running up and down this hill I was especially concerned of what the gills girls might think. and so I started to argue with these men so little reckless now 16 I got lucky and to the same predicament because of his uniform they speak to him differently to explain to him that they're just following orders so he takes her radio talks to their boss and gets his All released. what lessons would you take from an experience like this for me leadership matters those men are following the orders of a superior officer. I learn something about courage it was important not to look at those guns. and I also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls. so a few years. after this event I leave Ghana on a scholarship to go to Swarthmore College education. you know the faculty there didn't want us to memorize information repeat back to them as I was used to backing down aren't they wanted us to think critically they wanted us to be analytical they wanted us to be concerned about social issues. in my economics classes I got high marks to my understanding of basic economics but I learn something more profound than that which is that. the leaders the managers of Ghana's economy were making breathtakingly bad decisions that had brought our economy to the brink of collapse and to listen again leadership matters it matters a great deal. really fully understand what happened to me that's why I had I had an Inkling. but I didn't fully realize it until I went out into the workplace and I went to work at Microsoft Corporation and now it's part of this team just thinking learning whose job it was to design and Implement new software the created value in the world and it was it was brilliant to be part of this team was brilliant and I realized just what it happened to me at Swarthmore this transformation the ability the ability to confront problems complex problems and to design solutions to those problems with the ability to create. is the most empowering thing that can happen to an individual and I was part of that. while I was Microsoft the annual revenues of that company grew larger than the GDP of the Republic of Ghana. and by the way it's continued to the what the Gap has widened since I left. no I've already spoken about one of the reasons why this is occurred I mean is the people there were so hard-working persistent creative. I'm empowered. but there are also some external factors. free markets the rule of law infrastructure these things were provided by institutions run by the people that I call leaders and those leaders did not emerge spontaneously somebody trained them to do their work that they do. now while I was at Microsoft this funny thing happened I became a parent and for the first time Africa mattered more to me than ever before because I realized did the state of the African continent would matter to my children and their children that the state of the world. state of the world depends on what happening to Africa as far as my kids would be concerned and at this time when I was going through but I called my pre midlife crisis.Africa was a mess Somali had disintegrated into Anarchy Rwanda was in the throes of this genocide of war and it seemed to me that was exactly the wrong direction and I needed to be back helping I couldn't just stay in Seattle and and raise my kids in the upper middle-class neighborhood and and feel good about it this is not the world that that I'd want my children to grow up in so I decided to get engaged and the first thing that I did was to come back to Ghana and talk with a lot of people and really try to understand what the real issues were. and three things kept coming on. every problem corruption weak institutions and the people who run them the leaders. now. I was a little scared because when you see those three problems they seem really hard to deal with and they might say look don't even try but for me I asked a question while where these lead is coming from. what what is it about Ghana that produces leaders that are unethical. Bonnie able to solve problems so I went to look at what's happening and I to Kason system it's the same learning by rote from primary school through graduate school very little emphasis on ethics and the end the average. he was a typical graduate from the University in Ghana. has a stronger sense of entitlement than the sense of responsibility this is wrong so I decided to engage this particular problem. because it seems to me that every society. every society must be very intentional about how he trains leaders and Ghana was not paying enough attention and this is true across sub-Saharan Africa actually. so this is what I'm doing I'm trying to bring. the experience that I had at Swarthmore to Africa I wish there was a liberal arts college in every African country. I think it would make a huge difference and what is chassis University is trying to do. is to train a new generation of ethical entrepreneurial leaders were trying to train leaders of exceptional Integrity who have the ability to confront the complex problems. The right questions and come up with a workable Solutions. I'll admit that there are times when it seems like Mission Impossible. we must believe that these kids are smart that if we involve them in their education if we have them discuss the real issues they confront the whole society confronts and if we give them skills that enabled them to engage the real world that magic will happen. now. a month. into this project with just started classes and a month into it I come to the office and I have his email from one of our students and it said very simply I am thinking now. and he signs off thank you. such a simple. statement but I was moved almost to tears because I understood. what's happening to this young man and it is an awesome thing. to be a part of empowering someone in this way. I'm thinking now. this year we challenged our students. to craft an honor code from selves is a very vibrant debate going on on campus now about whether they should have an honor code and if so what it should look like one of the students ask a question that just warms my heart. can we create a perfect Society. her understanding that a student crafted on a code constitutes at reach towards perfection. incredible. now we cannot achieve Perfection but if we reach for it. then we can achieve Excellence I don't know ultimately what they'll do I don't know what they will decide to have his honor code but the conversation that they're having now about what they're good Society should look like but they're excellent Society should look like it's a really good thing. my apps time. okay. now. I just want to leave that slide up. because it's important that we think about it. I'm very excited about the fact that every student of the chefs the university does community service before they graduate that for many of them it has been a life-altering experience these young Future Leaders. are beginning to understand. the real business of leadership the real privilege of leadership which is after all to serve Humanity. I'm even more thrilled by the fact that last year our student body elected a woman to be the head of student government it's the first time in the history of Ghana that a woman has been elected head of student government at any University. it says a lot about her it says a lot about the culture that's forming on campus it says a lot about her peers who elected her she won with 75% of the vote. and it gives me a lot of Hope. it turns out the corporate West Africa also appreciates what's happening with our students we've graduated two classes students today and every single one of them has been placed and we're getting great reports back from corporate Ghana Corporate West Africa and the things have been most impressed about is work ethic. that passion what they're doing the persistence their ability to deal with ambiguity their ability to tackle problems they haven't seen before. this is good. because you know. over the past five years have been times when I felt this is Mission Impossible and it's just wonderful to see so these glimmers of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right. I think the current and Future Leaders of Africa have an incredible opportunity. to drive a major Renaissance on the continent. it's an incredible opportunity. Very many more opportunities like this in the world I believe that Africa has reached an inflection point. with the march of democracy and free markets across the continent we have reached a moment from which could emerge a great society within one generation it will depend on inspired leadership. and it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders will make all the difference thank you God bless,0.67578125
NielsDiffrient_2002a,so you don't get hard spots you cant hit your elbow on bottom and i did want to demonstrate the fact that the chair can accommodate people while you're sitting in it you can adjust it down for the five footer or you can adjust it for the six foot six guy all within the scope of a few simple adjustments so as a youngster i tried to get close to this by drawing airplanes constantly drawing  airplanes it's the way i got a part of this romance and of course in a way when i say romance i mean in part the aesthetics of that whole situation i think the word is the holistic experience revolving around a product the product was that airplane but it built a romance even the parts of the airplane five years old i fell in love with airplanes now i'm talking about the  had french names the fuselage the you know from a romance language so that it was something that just got into your spirit it did mine and i decided i had to get closer than just drawing the appearance drawings were not enough you couldn't transfer those to the model itself if you wanted it to fly you had to learn the discipline of flying you had to learn about aeronautics i had to give up the approach of drawing the fantasy shapes and convert it to technical drawings the shape of the wing the shape of the fuselage and so on and build an airplane over these drawings that i knew followed some of the principles of flying and in so doing i could produce a model that would fly stay in the air and it had once it was in the air some of this romance that i was in love with well the act of drawing airplanes led me to when i had the opportunity to choose a course in school led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering  and when i was sitting in classes in which no one asked me to draw an airplane to my surprise i had to learn mathematics and mechanics and all this sort of thing i'd wile away my time drawing airplanes in the class one day a young man looked over my shoulder he said you draw very well you should be in the art department and i said why he said well for one thing there are more girls there so my romance was temporarily shifted and i went in to art because they appreciated drawing studied painting didn't do very well at that went through  design some architecture eventually hired myself out as a designer and for the following twenty five years living in italy living in america i doled out a piece of this romance to anybody who 'd pay for it  sense this aesthetic feeling for  revolving around a designed object it exists any of you who rode the automobiles was it yesterday at the track you know the romance revolving around those high performance cars well in twenty five years i was mostly putting out pieces of this romance and not getting a lot back in because design on call had high leather boots jodhpurs an old leather jacket a wonderful helmet and those marvelous goggles and inevitably a white scarf  doesn't always connect you with a circumstance in which you can produce things of this nature so after twenty five years i began to feel as though i was running dry  and i quit and i started up a very small operation went from forty people to one in an effort to rediscover my innocence i wanted to get back where the romance was i couldn't choose airplanes because they had gotten sort of unromantic at that point even though i'd done a lot of airplane work on the interiors so i chose furniture and i chose chairs specifically because i knew something about them  designed a lot of chairs over the years for tractors and trucks and submarines all kinds of things  but not office chairs so i started doing that and i found that there were ways to duplicate the same approach that i used to use on the airplane only this time for a chair you have to learn a lot about how to deal with the body and what the body needs wants i ended up designing the chair i'm going to show you i should say one more thing when i was doing those model airplanes i did everything i conceived the kind of airplane i basically engineered it i built it and i flew it and that's the way i work now when i started this chair it was not a preconceived notion design nowadays if you mean it you don't start with styling sketches to flow in the wind he'd always walk up to his airplane in a kind of i started with a lot of loose ideas roughly eight or nine years ago and the loose ideas had something to with what i knew happened with people in the office people who worked and used task seating a great many of them sitting in front of a computer all day long and i felt the one thing they don't need is a chair that interferes with their main reason for sitting there  so i took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible or as mechanistically possible so that they didn't have to fuss with it so my idea was that now that may not mean a lot to some of you but you know most good chairs do recline because it's beneficial to open up this joint between your legs and your upper body for better breathing and better flow so that if you sit down on my chair tall or six foot six it always deals with your weight and transfers the amount of force required to recline in a way that you don't have to look for something to adjust i'll tell you right up front this is a trade off there are drawbacks to this one is you can't accommodate everybody  but the compromise i felt was in my favor because most people don't adjust their chairs they will sit in them forever i had somebody bus out to the racetrack tell me about his sister calling him he said she had one of the new better chairs she said oh i love it she said but it's too high so he cigarette away grab the girl  come over and look at it he came over and looked at it he reached down he pulled a lever and the chair sank down she said oh it's wonderful how did you do that showed her the lever well that's typical of a lot of us working in chairs and why should you get a twenty page manual about how to run a chair i had one for a wristwatch once twenty pages anyway i felt that it was important that you didn't have to make an adjustment in order to get this kind of action the other thing i felt was that armrests had never really been properly approached from the standpoint of how much of how much of an aide they could be to your work life but i felt it was too much to ask to have to adjust each individual arm rest in order to get it where you wanted mount his airplane maybe for the last time of course i always wondered what would happen if he'd kissed the airplane first so i spent a long time i said i worked on eight or nine years on it and each of these things went along sort of in parallel but incrementally were a problem of their own i worked a long time on figuring out how to move the arms over a much greater arc that is up and down and make them a lot easier so that you didn't have to use a button and so after many trials many failures we came up with a very simple arrangement in which we could just move one arm or the other and they go up easily and stop where you want you can put them down essentially out of the way no arms at all or you can pull them up where you want them and this was another thing that i felt while not nearly as romantic as cary grant  nevertheless begins to grab a little bit of aesthetic operation aesthetic performance into a product the next area that was of interest to me was the fact that reclining was a very important factor and the more you can recline in a way the better it is the more the angle between here and here opens up and nowadays with a screen in front of you you don't want to have your eye drop too far in the recline so we keep it at more or less the same level but you transfer weight off your tailbones all the weight of your upper torso your arms your head goes right down through your back your spine into those bones when you sit and that's a lot of load just relieving your arms with armrests takes twenty percent of that load off now that if your spine is not held in a good position  will help bend your spine the wrong way and so on so to unload that  great weight indeed exists you can recline when you recline you take away a lot of that load off your bottom end and transfer it to your back but this was real romance to me the same time as i say you open up this joint and breathability is good but to do that if you have any amount of recline it gets to the point where you need a headrest because nearly always you have to use muscle force to hold your head there so that's where a headrest comes in now headrest is a challenge because you want it to adjust enough so that it will fit you know a tall guy and a short girl so here we are  got five inches of adjustment here in order to get the headrest in the right place but then i knew from experience and looking around in offices where there were chairs with headrests nobody would ever bother to reach back and turn a knob and adjust the headrest to put it in position and you need it in a different position when you're upright then when you're reclined so i knew that had to be solved and had to be automatic so if you watch this chair as i recline  the headrest comes up to meet my neck ideally you want to put the head support in  cranial area right there so that part of it took a long time to work out and put gel in the cushions and in the armrests to absorb point load distributes the loading ,when I was 5 years old. I fell in love with airplanes. I'm talking about the thirties. in the thirties an airplane have two wings and around motor. will always flown. by guy who look like Cary Grant. had high leather boots jodhpurs an old leather jacket. a wonderful helmet in those marvelous goggles. and inevitably a wife's car. the flow in the Wind. it always walk up to his airplane and I kind of saw her devil-may-care saunter. flicked a cigarette away. grab the girl waiting there give her a kiss. and then mouth is airplane maybe for the last time cuz I always wondered what would happen if you kissed the airplane first.but this was real romance to me. everything about flying in those years which was you have I have to stop and think for a moment was probably the most advanced technological thing going on at the time. so as a youngster I tried to get close to this 5 drawing airplanes constantly drawing airplanes the way I got a part of this romance and of course in a way when I say romance I mean in part the Aesthetics of that whole situation I think the word is the holistic experience revolving around a product the product was that airplane but it built a romance even the parts of the airplane. had French names see if usual I see you in pain you know it was something that just got into your spirit it did mine and I decided I had to get closer than just drawing. fantasy airplanes I wanted to build airplanes so I build model airplanes my phone then doing the model airplanes. their parents drawings we're not enough you couldn't transfer those to the model itself if you wanted it to fly you had to learn the discipline of flying you had to learn about Aeronautics you had to learn what made an airplane stay in the air and of course as a model than those years you couldn't control it so I had to be self writing and stay up without crashing. so I had to give up the approach of drawing the fantasy shapes. and convert it to technical drawings the shape of the wing shape of the fuselage and so on and build an airplane over these drawings that I knew had followed some of the principles of flying and in so doing I could produce a model that would fly stay in the air and it had once it was in the are some of this romance but I was in love with. well the fact of drawing airplanes LED m. when I had the opportunity to choose a course in school led me to sign up for Aeronautical Engineering. and when I was sitting in classes. and wish no one asked me to draw an airplane to my surprise I had to learn mathematics and mechanics and all of this sort of thing I'd while away my time drawing airplanes in the class one day young man looked over my shoulder said you draw very well you should be in the art department and I said well for one thing there more girls there. so my romance was temporarily shifted. and I went into art because they appreciated drawing studied painting didn't do very well if that went through design some architecture eventually hired myself out as a designer and for the following 25 years living in Italy Living in America I doled out a piece of this Romance. so anybody who pay for it. the sense this aesthetic feeling for the experience revolving around a designed object. and it exists you know if any of you who rode the automobiles yesterday was yesterday at the track you know the romance revolving around around those high for high performance cars. well I'm 25 years. I was mostly putting out pieces of this romance and not getting a lot back in cuz design on call doesn't always connect you with a circumstance which you can produce things of this nature so after 25 years I began to feel as though I was running dry. I quit. and I started up a very small operation went from 40 people to one. in an effort to ReDiscover my innocence. I wanted to get back where the romance was. and I couldn't choose airplanes because I'd gotten sort of on romantic at the point even though I've done a lot of airplane work on the Interiors. so I chose furniture. and I chose chairs specifically because I knew something about them I designed a lot of chairs over the years for tractors and trucks and submarines all kinds of things but not office chairs so I started doing that and I found that there were ways to duplicate the same approach that I used to use on the airplane only this time instead of the product being shaped by the wind it was shaped by the human body. so the discipline was as in the airplane you learn a lot about how to deal with the air. four-chair you have to learn a lot about how to deal with the body and what the body needs wants indicates it needs and that's the way Altamonte Lee after some ups and downs. I ended up signing the chair I'm going to show you and I should say one more thing when I was doing those. model airplanes. I did everything I conceived the kind of airplane. I basically engineered it. I built it. and I flew it. and that's the way I work now. I started this chair it was not a preconceived notion design nowadays if you mean it you don't start with styling sketches. I started with a lot of loose ideas roughly eight or nine years ago and the loose ideas had some something to do with what I knew happened with people in the office at workplace people who worked and use tax eating great many of them sitting in front of a computer all day long. and I felt the one thing they don't need is a chair that interferes with their main reason for sitting there so I try but the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible or is it possible and mechanistically possible so they didn't have to fuss with it so my idea was that instead of sitting down and reaching for a lot of controls that you would sit on the chair and it do it automatically balance your weight against the force required to recline. now that may not mean a lot to some of you but you know most good chairs do recline because it's beneficial to open up this joint between your legs and your upper body for better breathing better flow so that if you sit down on my chair. if your what are your five feet tall or six foot six it always deals with your weight. and transfers the amount of force required recline in a way that you don't have to look for something to adjust. I'll tell you right up front this is a trade-off. there are drawbacks to this. one is you can't accommodate everybody. there's some very like people some extremely heavy people maybe people with a lot of bulk up top they begin to fall off the end of your chart. but the compromise I felt was in my favor because most people don't adjust the chairs there so they will sit in them forever I have somebody on the bus out to the racetrack tell me about his sister calling him and said she had one of the new better chairs and she said I'd love it if it's too high. any. is it it's alright well I'll come over and look at it and came over and looked at it you reach down and pull the lever in the chair signs down she's always wonderful how did you do that and just show them the letter well that's typical of a lot of us working chair then why should you get a 20-page manual about how to run a chair. I had one for a wrist watch Once. Funny Pages anyway I felt it was important that you didn't have to make an adjustment in order to get this kind of action the other thing I felt was the armrest has never really been. properly approached from the standpoint of how much of an aid they could be to your work life but I felt it was too much to ask to have to adjust each individual armrest in order to get it where you wanted so I spent a long time I said I worked eight or nine years on it and each of these things went a long sort of a l l b incrementally or problem of their own I worked a long time on figuring out how to move the arms over a much greater Ark that is up and down. and make them a lot easier but you didn't have to use the button that's why after many trials many failures we came up with a very simple arrangement in which we can just move one arm of the other didn't go up easily. Where you want and you put them down out of the way no arms at all or even pull them up where you want them. this was another thing that I fell while not nearly as romantic as Cary Grant nevertheless begins to grab a little bit of aesthetic operation aesthetic performance into a product the next area that was of interest to me for the fact that reclining is a very important factor in the more you can recline and Away the better it is the more of the angle between here and here opens up and nowadays with a screen in front of you don't want to have your eye drop too far in the recline so we keep it at the more less the same level. but you transfer weight off your tail bones but everybody put their hand under the bottom and feel their tailbone. you feel that phone under there. just your own. there's two of them one on either side.all of the weight of your upper torso your arms your head goes right down through your back your spine into those bones when you said and that's a lot of load just relieving your arms with armrest takes 20% of that load off and all that if your if your bottles fine is not held in a good position will Ben just helped Benders find the wrong way and so on so to unload that great weight. if if that indeed exists you can recline when you recline you take away a lot of that load off your bottom end and transfer it to your back the same time as I say you open up this joint and breathability is good. but to do that and you have a if you have any amount of brake line it gets to the point where you need a headrest. because. nearly always. automatically hold your head in a vertical position see if I recline my head stays more or less vertical well in a recliner great deal you have to use Muscle Force hold your head there so that's where I had rest comes down the headrest is a challenge because you want it to adjust enough so that. you know the tall guy short girl so here we are. I've Got 5 inches of adjustment here. in order to get the headrest in the right place but then I knew from what experience and looking around in offices where they were chairs with headrest. but nobody would ever bother to reach back and turning knob and adjust the headrest put in position and you need it in a different position when you're off right then when you're replying so I knew that had to be solved and had to be automatic so if you watch this chair as I reclined they address comes up to meet my neck ideal you want to put the head support in the cranial area right there so that. that part of it took a long time to work it out and a variety of other things the shape of the cushions the. shall we put we stole the idea from bicycle seats and put gel in the cushions in the armrest to absorb absorb Point load distributes the loading there don't get hard spots you can't he'll hit your elbow on bottom and I did wanted to demonstrate the fact that the chair can accommodate people while you're sitting in it you can adjust it down for the five footer or you can adjust it. for the six foot six guy. all within the scope of a few simple adjustments,0.76953125
JohnHodgman_2008,i am not a scientist i have never built an atomic pile  although i might argue that technically every pile is atomic did not consider one is that the aliens might be very far away perhaps i dare say even on other planets the other possibility is perhaps enrico fermi himself was an alien  think about it isn't it a little convenient that in the midst of the world war out of nowhere suddenly an italian scientist showed up with an amazing new technology would transform everything in the world and darken our history of the human species forever after and isn't it a little strange that he required no payment for that he asked for only one thing a gift of two healthy sperm whales that's that's not true but it is  and if enrico fermi was indeed a space alien wouldn't he be  first to have tried to convince his fellow scientists that the space aliens are not already here for it is given in certain ufo ology or ufology circles that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia that they have walked among us in disguise observing us guiding our evolution from ape to man if you believe in that sort of thing  and occasionally kidnapping us in their flying saucers and taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids it's a difficult theory to discount i think you'll agree for even in my own life  memories i have that are difficult to explain happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird that it is difficult to imagine they were not the result of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life for how else will you explain the amazing and absolutely true close encounters that i had and will describe to you now  went to lunch at los alamos national laboratory and joined some colleagues there and asked them a question where is everybody this confused his colleagues obviously because they were sitting right there with him i was pretty good at the video games i was not very good at the other part so i stayed alone with the cosmos and that's when it elderly couple came walking down the street i would say they were in their late seventies and i would say that they were on a date because he was wearing a very neat little suit with a yellow tie brown suit and she was wearing a cardigan because it was now fully night now and a chill was coming in off the ocean have to admit that's a pretty boss piece of detective work for an old man on a date but what was stranger still and even i realized it at the time as a nine year old child was that they stopped at all that this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll with his sweetheart with the precise reason of making fun of a child oh he said little green men and then his girlfriend joined in too there 's no such thing as space men she said  there 's no such thing and then they both laughed ha ha ha i looked around  and then he had to clarify that he wasn't talking about them he was talking about the space aliens you see this was only a few years after the street was entirely empty i had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean it was as though time had stopped i did not know why they were teasing me i looked into their strangely angry faces and i remember wondering are they wearing rubber masks and what would be behind those rubber masks if they were giant almond shaped unblinking eyes slits for mouths the old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun and then he made laser sounds kew kew kew watch out and they turned at once and walked away the old man reached out his knobbly claw for the woman 's hand and found it and left me alone you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding a strange encounter among humans maybe it was swamp gas but i know what i saw the supposed flying saucer crash at roswell new mexico and even though that turned out to be nothing nothing at all she was very tall i would say i was starting high school at the time i would say she was a junior but i had never seen her before she didn't go to my school i didn't know her name and i never will she was sitting with someone who i presume was her mother and they were talking about the novel dune they were both big fans mother and daughter very unusual they were talking about how their favorite characters were the giant sandworms and then it got stranger that's when she turned to me and said are you looking forward to seeing the movie care about the answer as though she just wanted to talk to me i did not know what to say i said yes i did not even turn my head the movie began i need not remind you that this was david lynch 's version of dune in which all of the characters were sexy and deformed at the same time there was a character called the third stage guild navigator which was a kind of giant floating fetus that lived in a giant tank with this orange mist of psychedelic spice swirling around him allowing him to bend space and time he could never leave the tank or interact with the outside world he'd become in his isolation so deformed and so sexy that he had to talk through a kind of old timey radio to the outside world and could never touch them i mean i liked him a lot better than the sandworms the sandworms were fine but your favorite character merely a downed weather balloon piloted by small hairless men with slits for mouths still america had gone saucer mad even famous scientists who were eating lunch  when the movie ended as i walked out her pace slowed perhaps it was the crutches but it seemed it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again when i say it out loud it sounds so ridiculous but i can only come to the conclusion that it was what in the alien abductee community they call a screen memory a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain to cover up some trauma say of being kidnapped and flown off to a sex pyramid in which he described his own lifelong experiences being abducted by aliens and he also described the phenomenon known in this community as lost time where whitley strieber would suddenly become aware that he could not remember the previous ten minutes or the previous ten hours or the previous ten days and would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens were taking him and giving him rectal probes this book became naturally an enormous best seller this image by ted joseph was from that book and was his sort of police sketch of what the creatures looked like that whitley strieber described and we decided apropos of nothing to go see this movie and the way i remember it the movie featured these details one  was played by christopher walken  the alien was played by a rubber puppet  three there was a surprisingly long sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet gives christopher walken a rectal probe this was being shown in a regular movie theater in center city philadelphia five all of which is to say they made a movie out of the book communion and it starred christopher walken does something seem strange about this how did this happen when did this happen i remember walking out of the theater and becoming suddenly aware of this fact as we walked hand in hand and pondering these very same questions and to this day i have no answer for through the south of portugal together  we stayed in old crumbling walled cities in tiny little hotels and we would climb up to the roof and drink vinho verde and watch the sun set and play checkers what did we do this really does anyone do this we went to some topless beaches excuse me no not in my life for what it's worth we went to sagres which was considered at the time to be the end of the world and there i was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the and the lead dog bit me on the ass requiring me to go to a strange portuguese clinic and receive an ass shot make of that what you will our last day in portugal we were in the district capital and catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach one last time now faro is a bustling little city and to get to the beach she explained you would have to take  bus and then a boat and did i want to come with but i was exhausted and dog bitten and so i said no i remember what she looked like before she left the freckles had grown and multiplied on her face and shoulders  clustering into a kind of a tan a tan we were both tan is this true her eyes were extra bright and extra blue as a result she was smiling she was a single woman about to go alone into a country not even speaking the language to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen we should have some evidence of their existence by now and yet to the best of our knowledge we are alone where is everybody asked fermi and his colleagues had no answer i loved her and then she went out into that strange alien land it took me some time to come to my senses now i did not speak portuguese  i did not know where the beach was i realized that the day would only have two possible outcomes either catherine would come back to the hotel or she would never come back to the hotel and so i sat down to wait i did not watch the skies but the very end of the street where the buses and cars and pedestrians and little scooters were moving along and i watched those constellations shift hoping that they would part and i would see her face  was at that moment in that very small town of thirty thousand or so that i truly appreciated the vastness of the universe and the searching we might do and that's when the liberians came along five young men all laughing happy traveling together coming back to this hotel where they were one of them was named joseph and he asked me what was i doing and i explained and he said don 't worry he was sure that catherine would be safe but he did not seem so very sure for he sat down to wait with me then went on with the same blunt logic to disprove fairies sasquatch god the possibility of love and thereafter as you know enrico fermi ate alone and even now a decade and a half later even now that we are married i look for her still whenever she is not in the room and even though i think you'll agree it is probable that during the time she was away she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone i love her and wait for her still thank you for your kind attention ,"he won't know this story in the summer of 1950 Enrico Fermi the Italian American physicist and atomic pile Builder went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory enjoying some colleagues there and ask him a question where is everybody this confused his colleagues obviously because they were sitting right there with him and then he had to clarify that he wasn't talking about them he was talking about the space aliens you see this is only a few years after the supposed Flying Saucer crash at Roswell New Mexico and even though that turned out to be nothing nothing at all. nearly a downed weather balloon piloted by small hairless men. with slits for Mouse saucer mad even famous scientist who are eating lunch universe is so vast that it stands to reason there should be other intelligent life out there and the universe is so old that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve we should have some evidence of their existence by now and get to the best of our knowledge we are alone where is everybody at Fermi and his colleagues had no answer for me then went on with the same blunt logic to disprove fairies Sasquatch God the possibility of love and thereafter as you know Enrico Fermi ate alone. now. I am not a scientist I have never built an atomic pile although I might argue that technically every pile is atomic. however with respect I might point out to possibilities that Enrico Fermi perhaps did not consider one visit the aliens might be very far away perhaps I daresay even on other planets. the other possibility. is perhaps Enrico Fermi himself was an alien. think about it isn't it a little convenience when in the midst of the world war out of nowhere suddenly an Italian scientist showed up with an amazing new technology that would transform everything in the world and dark in our history of the human species Forever After and isn't it a little strange that he required no payment for this but that he asked for only one thing a gift of two healthy sperm whales that's what it is. and if Enrico Fermi was indeed a space alien wouldn't he be the first to try to convince his fellow scientist the space aliens are not already here for it is given in certain UFO apology or ufology circles that the aliens are already here and have been for Millennia that they have walked Among Us in Disguise observing us guiding our Evolution from ape to man if you believe in that sort of thing. and occasionally kidnapping us in their flying saucers and taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids. it's a difficult Theory to Discount I think you will agree. or even in my own life there are memories I have that are difficult to explain happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird that it is difficult to imagine they were not the result of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life for all else will you explain the amazing and absolutely true Close Encounters that I had and will describe to you now encounter One Ocean City New Jersey 1980 this was the summer when they special edition of Close Encounters of the Third Kind was released and I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey Shore within 12 hours I was horribly sunburnt just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie. and so I spent the rest of the vacation largely sitting outside a little rental house at night the sidewalk still warm from the Sun watching the skies for UFOs what did I See Stars satellites blinking airplanes typical Sky junk occasionally kids would come and join me and watch but their next soon. Sore and they would go off to the boardwalk to play video games and mingle with humans I was pretty good at the video games I was not very good at the other part so I stayed and alone with the cosmos and that's when it happened and elderly couple came walking down the street I would say they were in their late seventies and I would say that they were on a date because he was wearing a very neat little suit with a yellow tie brown suit and she was wearing a cardigan because it was now fully night now and a chill was coming in off the ocean I remember for some reason that they were exactly the same height and then they stopped and the man turned to me and said. what are you looking for flying saucers. peppermint that's pretty boss piece of detective work for an old man on a date. but what was stranger still and even I realized it at the time as a nine-year-old child was that they stopped at all that this old man would interrupt his Moonlight stroll with his sweetheart with the precise reason of making fun of a child. oh he said little green man and then his girlfriend joined into there's no such thing as Space men she said there's no such thing and then they both laughed hahaha I looked around the street was entirely empty I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean it was as though time had stopped I did not know why they were teasing me I looked into their strangely angry faces and I remember wondering are they wearing rubber masks. and what would be behind those rubber masks that they were giant almond-shaped unblinking eyes slits from as the old man croaked his finger as though he were firing a gun and then he made laser sounds and they turned and walked away the old man reached out his knobley claw for the for the yacht woman's hand and found it and left me alone now you could just ride this is a simple misunderstanding a strange encounter among humans maybe it was swamp gas but. I know what I saw. close encounter to Brookline Massachusetts 1984 I went to see the movie Dune and a girl talk to me. this is impossible on its face I realized but it is absolutely true it was opening night naturally I went with my friend Tim mcgonagle who sat on my left on my right was the girl in question she had long curly black hair a blue jean jacket I remember she had some sort of injury to her ankle an Ace bandage and she had crutches she was very tall I would say I was starting high school at the time I would say she was a junior but I never seen her before she didn't go to my school I didn't know her name and I never will she was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother and they were talking about the novel Dune they were both big fans mother and daughter very unusual. they were talking about how their favorite characters were the Giant sandworms and then it got stranger that's when she turned to me and said are you looking forward to seeing the movie. first of all I was in Paris cuz I had not read the novel Dune at that time I was merely a connoisseur of movies featuring desert Planet as I still am. but it's also the town of how she asked the question apropos of nothing like she didn't even care about the answer as though she just wanted to talk to me I did not know what to say I said yes I did not even turn my head the movie began I need not remind you that this was David Lynch's version of Dune in which all of the characters were sexy and deformed at the same time there was a character called the Giant floating fetus creature that lived in a giant tank with the mist of psychedelic spice swirling around him allowing him to bend space and time he could never leave the tank or interact with the outside world had become in his isolation so deformed and so sexy that he had to talk through a kind of old-timey radio to the outside world and could never touch them I mean I liked him a lot better than the sandworms the sandworms were fine. but your favorite character please when the movie ended. everyone seemed very happy to get up and get out of the theater as soon as possible. except for the girl as I walked out her Pace slowed perhaps it was the precious but it seemed. it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again when I say it out loud it sounds so ridiculous that I can only come to the conclusion that it was what in the alien abductee Community they call a screen memory a ridiculous false recollection designed by the brain to cover up some trauma they are being kidnapped and flown off to a sex pyramid. and so I sure am glad I did not slow down to talk to her I sure am glad I never saw her again. close encounter three Philadelphia Pennsylvania 1989 in the late 80s the novelist Whitley strieber read a book called communion in which he described his own life experiences being abducted by aliens and he also describe the phenomenon known in this community as lost time where Whitley strieber would suddenly become aware that he could not remember the previous 10 minutes or the previous 10 hours for the previous 10 days and would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens were taking him and giving him rectal probes. this book became naturally an enormous best seller this image by Ted Joseph was from that book and was his sort of police sketch of what the creatures look like that would be 34 described him and was so successful that they made it into a movie and a 1989 the way I remember it I was in Philadelphia with visiting my girlfriend and we decided apropos of nothing to go see this movie and the way I remember it the movie featured these details 1 Whitley strieber was played by Christopher Walken to the alien was played by a rubber puppet. 3 there was a surprisingly long sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet gives Christopher Walken a rectal probe. for this was being shown in a regular movie theater in Center City Philadelphia to say they made a movie out of the book communion and it starred Christopher Walken something strange about this to you something odd something off something wrong with this picture think about it yes the answer is I had a girlfriend what. how did this happen when did this happen I remember walking out of the theater in becoming suddenly aware of this fact as we walked hand-in-hand and pondering these very same question and to this day I have no answer for you. close encounter for the Algarve Portugal 1991 some Years Later by and this woman will call her Catherine Fletcher. when traveling through the south of Portugal together we stayed in Old crumbling walled cities in tiny little hotels and we would climb up to the roof and drink vinho Verde and watch the sunset and play checkers what did we do this really does anyone do this we went to some topless beaches excuse me no not in my life for what it's worth we went to Sawgrass which was considered at the time to be the end of the world and there I was chased by a pack of feral dogs in the dock and the lead dog bit me on the ass requiring me to go to a strange Portuguese clinic and received an ass shot make of that what you will. our last day in Portugal where in the district capital of Farah and Catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach one last time. how far away is a bustling little city in to get to the beach she explained you have to take a bus and then a boat and did I want to come with but I was exhausted and dog didn't and so I said no I remember what she look like before she left. the freckles had grown and Multiplied on her face and shoulders clustering into a kind of at an attack and we're both tan the true. her eyes were extra bright and extra blue as a result she was smiling she was a single woman about to go alone into a country not even speaking the language to travel alone by bus and boats to go to a beach she did not know that I had never seen. I loved her and then she went out and did that strange alien land. it took me some time to come to my senses I have my own lost-time moment where I woke up and suddenly realize it was a very late in the day almost dinner time and she has not come back nervous I went down to the street to look for her now I did not speak Portuguese I did not know where the beach was I could not call her on a cell phone because this is 1991 and the aliens had not given us that technology. I realize that the day would only have two possible outcomes either Catherine would come back to the hotel or she would never come back to the hotel and so I sat down to wait I did not watch the skies for the very end of the street where the buses and cars and pedestrians and little scooters were moving along and I watched those constellations shift hoping that they would part and I would see her face it was at that moment and that very small town of 30,000 or so but I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe and the searching we might do in it and that's when the liberians came along five young men all laughing happy traveling together coming back to this hotel where they were staying one of them was named Joseph and he asked me what was I doing and I explained that he said don't worry he was sure that Catherine would be safe but he's not seem so very sure before he sat down to wait with me and for the next 2 hours they all waited with me taking turns going up to their room coming back to tell him. Jug's distracting me 2 hours they gave me a message we are not alone and then in the middle of a sentence of the very birth of Pi like I turned and looked down the street the Stars aligned and she came back she was smiling she did not understand why I was so worried night of the Librarians though there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter as they clapped us on the back and went back up to the room and left us alone in the street holding hands event like this leaves a scar on the memory much like a piece of alien technology but has been inserted into your buttocks by a Portuguese doctor. and even now a decade-and-a-half later even now that we are married I look for her still whenever she is not in the room. and even though I think you'll agree it is probable the during the time she was away she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone I love her and wait for her still thank you for your kind attention",0.8190103769302368
SherylWuDunn_2010G,she still made the two hour trek to the schoolhouse and tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors we wrote about her in the new york times it's an anecdote that i'll leave you with and that is the story of an aid worker in darfur here was was a woman who had worked in darfur seeing things that no human being should see throughout her time there  and she saw something that made her break down in tears the great fortune to be born in a country we not only can feed clothe and that with that great fortune you me all won the lottery of life  feel happier and help save the world thank you very much  we got a flood of donations thirteen dollar checks because new york times readers are very generous in tiny amounts but then we got a money transfer for dollar ten thousand really nice guy  we turned the money over to that man there the principal of the school he was delighted he thought oh i can renovate the school i can give scholarships to all the girls you know if they work hard and stay in school  so dai manju basically finished out middle school she went to high school she went to vocational school for accounting she scouted for jobs down in guangdong province in the south she found a job she scouted for jobs for her classmates and her friends she sent money back to her family they built a new house this time with running water electricity a bicycle no what we saw was a natural it is rare to get an exogenous investment in girls education and over the years as we followed dai manju we were able to see that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle that i want to talk to you about today  and into a virtuous cycle she not only changed her own dynamic she changed her household she changed her family her village the village became a real stand out of course most of china was flourishing at the time but they were able to get a road built to link them up to the rest of china rarely makes the front pages it however is enormous in both scale and  and that brings me to my first major of two tenets of in the nineteenth century it was slavery  in the twentieth century it was totalitarianism the cause of our time is the brutality that so many people face around the world because of their gender she's exaggerating well let me ask you this question  most of you well you know this latter group you're wrong there are true enough in europe and the west when women and men have in most of the rest of the world that's not the case in fact demographers have shown that there are anywhere between sixty million and one hundred million missing females in the current population and you know it happens for several reasons for instance in the last half century more girls were discriminated to death all the people killed on all the battlefields in the twentieth century sometimes it's also because of the sonogram girls get aborted before they're even born  look you all are very well traveled this is tedglobal after all but i do hope to take you to some places you've never been to before  when there are scarce resources this girl here for instance is in a feeding center in ethiopia the entire center was filled with girls like her boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they depend upon the breast  from one to five girls die at a fifty percent higher mortality rate than boys in all of india the morality of all the right and wrong of it all and just on a purely practical level three reasons why this is the case  one of the persistent causes of poverty and you know when you educate a boy his family tends to have fewer kids but only slightly  when you educate a girl she tends to it has to do with spending it's kind of like the dirty little secret of poverty which is that not only do poor people take in very little income so let 's start off in china  also the income that they take in they don't spend it very wisely and unfortunately most of that spending is done by men so research has shown if you look at people who live under two dollars a day one metric of poverty two percent of that take home pay goes to this basket here in education this photo was taken two weeks ago just take four percentage points and put it into this basket you would have a transformative effect the last reason has to do with women being part of the solution not the problem you need to use scarce resources it's a waste of resources if you don't use someone like dai manju bill gates put it very well when he was traveling through saudi arabia he was speaking to an audience much like yourselves however two thirds of the way there was a barrier on this side was and then the barrier and this side was women and someone from this side of the room got up and said mister we have here as our goal in saudi arabia to be one of the top ten countries when it comes to technology do you think we'll make it so bill gates as he was staring out at the audience he said if you're not fully utilizing half the resources in your country there is no way you will get anywhere near the top ten so here is bill of arabia so what would some of the specific challenges look like i would say on the top of the agenda is sex trafficking and i'll just say two things about this  the slavery at the peak of the slave trade in the seventeen there were about eighty thousand slaves transported from africa to the new world now modern slavery according to state department rough statistics there are about eight hundred thousand ten times the number that are trafficked across international borders and that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders which is a substantial portion you can buy a girl trafficked for few hundred dollars  which means she's actually more disposable  but you know there is progress being made in places like cambodia and thailand we don't have to expect a world where girls are bought and sold or killed the second item on the agenda is maternal mortality in this part of the world is a wonderful event you know it's not as though we don't have the technological solution but these women have three strikes against them this is in the dabian mountains in the remote part of hubei province in central china dai manju is thirteen years old at the time the story starts she lives with her parents her two brothers and her great aunt they are poor they are rural and they are female  end up with an injury and the most devastating injury is obstetric fistula tearing during obstructed labor that leaves a woman let me tell you about mahabuba she lives in ethiopia she was married against her will at age thirteen she got pregnant ran to the bush to have the baby but you know her body was very immature and she ended up having obstructed labor that meant she was incontinent she couldn't control her wastes she fought off the hyenas with that and the next morning she new if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary she would be saved all the way thirty miles to that her to a nearby fistula hospital she was repaired with a three hundred and fifty dollar operation the problem she's moved out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle talk about some of the solutions and there are predictable solutions  she tends to have kids later on in life she tends to have fewer kids and those kids that she does have she educates them in a more enlightened fashion with economic opportunity it can be they have a hut that has no electricity no running water no wristwatch no bicycle and they share this great splendor with a very large pig at the time she was miserable she was beaten every single day by her husband who was unemployed he was kind of a gambler type and unemployable therefore and took his frustrations out on her well when she had her second daughter her i think you'd better get a second wife saima 's not going to produce you  at the time there was a microlending group in the village  sixty five dollar loan  and she started an embroidery business the merchants liked her embroidery it sold very well and they kept asking for more and when she couldn't produce enough she hired other women in the village pretty soon she had thirty women in the village working for her embroidery business and then when she had to  transport all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace she needed someone to help her do the transport so she hired her husband so now they're in it together he does the transportation and distribution and she does the production and sourcing and now they have a third daughter and  the daughters all of them are being tutored in education because saima knows what's really important which brings me to the final element which is education larry summers when he was chief economist at the world bank once said that it may well be that the highest return on investment in the developing world is in girls education she didn't go to school actually she had never been to school not to a lick one day was in sixth grade when her parents said we 're going to pull you out of school because the thirteen dollar school fees are too much for us you're going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies why would we waste this money on you so at nine years of age beatrice started in first grade after all she'd never been to a lick of school with a six year no matter she was just delighted to be in school she rocketed to the top of her class she stayed at the top of  and then in high school she scored brilliantly on the national examinations so that she became the first person in her village ever to come to the united states on scholarship two years ago she graduated from connecticut college on the day of her graduation she said i am the luckiest girl alive because of a goat so you see how transformative little bits of help can be i want to give you a reality check look u s aid helping people is not easy and there have been books that have criticized u s  bill easterly 's book there's a book called dead aid you know the criticism is fair it isn't easy you know people say how of all water well projects a year later failed when i was in zimbabwe we were touring a place with the village chief he wanted to raise money for a secondary school and there was some construction a few yards away and i said what  this is what happens to girls in remote areas turns out that dai manju was the turns out that it's a failed irrigation project few yards away was a failed chicken coop one year all the chickens died and no one wanted to put the chickens in there it's true but we think that you don't through the baby out with the bathwater you actually we also think that individuals can make a difference and they should because individuals together what's in it for you research shows best pupil in her you have all of your material needs taken care of which most of us all of us here in this room do  research shows that there are very few things in life that can actually elevate your level of happiness one of those things is ,"yoga challenge that I want to talk to you about today rarely makes the front page has its however is enormous in both scale and importance are you all a very well-traveled this is Ted Global after all but I do hope to take you to some places you've never been to before. so let's start off in China this photo was taken two weeks ago actually one indication is that little boy on my husband's shoulders is just graduated from high school this is Tiananmen Square many of you have been there it's not the real china let me take you to the real china this is in the davia mountains and the remote part of who they province in central China Diamond G was 13 years old at the time story starts she lives with her parents are her two brothers and her great-aunt they have a hut that has no electricity no running water no wristwatch new bicycle and they share this great splendour with a very large Pig. Diamond Jew I was in sixth grade when her parents said we're going to pull you out of school because that's $13 school fees are too much for us they're going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies why would we waste this money on you this is what happens to girls in remote areas turns out that diamonds you was the best pupil in her grave if she still made the 2-hour trip to the schoolhouse and try to capture every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors we wrote about her in the New York Times we got a flood of donations. mostly $13 checks because York Times readers are very generous in tiny amounts but then we got a money transfer for $10,000. really nice guy we turn the money over to that man there the principal of the school he was delighted he thought we can renovate the school I can give scholarships to all the girls you know if they work hard and stay in school at Diamond you basically finished out to middle school she went to high school she went to Vacation school for accounting she scouted for jobs down in Guangdong Province in the South she found a job she's got two jobs for a classmates and her friends she sent money back to her family they built a new house this time with running water and electricity a bicycle no Pig. what we saw was a natural experiment it is rare to get an exotic has investments in girls' education and over the years as we follow Diamond G we were able to see that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle she not only change her own but she changed her household she changed her family her Village The Village became a real standout of course most of China was flourishing at the time but they were able to get a road built to wake them up to the rest of China and that brings me to my first major of two tenants of the half guy and that is that the central moral challenge of this country is gender inequity. in the nineteenth century was slavery in the twentieth century was totalitarianism the cause of our time is the totality that so many people face around the world because of their gender the some of you may be thinking that's hyperbole she's exaggerating let me ask you this question how many do you think there are more males or females in the world let me take a poll tell me who think they are more males in the world. Please ask you how many there more females in the world okay. there are the true enough in Europe and the West when women and men have people asked access to Food and Health Care there are more women will live longer but in most of the rest of the world that's not the case in fact demographers have shown that there are anywhere between 60 million and 100 million missing females in the current population and you know it happens for a reason spring scents in the last half-century more girls were discriminated to death than all the people kill them all the battlefields in the twentieth century sometimes it's also because the song girls get aborted before they're even born. when they're scarce resources this girl here for incense is in a feeding Center in Ethiopia the entire Center was filled with girls like her what's remarkable is that her brothers in the same family were totally fine in India in the first year of life from zero to one boy and girl babies basically survive at the same right because they depend upon the breast and the rest shows no son preference from 125 girls died at a 50% higher mortality rate than boys in in all of India. the second tenets of half the sky is that let's put aside the morality of all the right and wrong of it all and just on Purely practical level we think that one of the best ways to fight poverty and to fight terrorism is to educate girls and bring women into the formal labor force. property for instance there are three reasons why this is the case. overpopulation is one of the persistent causes of poverty and you know when you educate a boy he has his family comes to have fewer kids but only slightly when you educated girl as she tends to have significantly fewer kids the second reason is it has to do with spending it's kind of like the Dirty Little Secret of poverty which is that not only do poor people taken very little income but also the income that they taking they don't spend it very wisely and unfortunately most of that spending is done by men so it's research has shown if you look at people who live under $2 a day one metric of of poverty 2% of that taken pay goes to this basket here in education. 20% goes to a basket that is a combination of Alcohol Tobacco sugary drinks in prostitution and festivals you just take four percentage points and put it into this basket you would have a transformative effect. the last reason has to do with women being part of the solution of the problem you need to use its scarce resources it's a waste of resources if you don't use someone like diamonds you Bill Gates put it very well when he was traveling through Saudi Arabia he was speaking to an audience much like yourselves however there was a barrier on this side with men and then the barrier and the said was women and someone from this side room. Up and said Mr dates we have here as our goal instead Ribbit to be one of the top 10 countries when it comes to technology do you think we'll make it to Bill Gates as he was staring out at the audience he said if you are not fully utilizing half the resources in your country there was no way you'll get anywhere near the top 10 so here is Bill of Arabia. what some of the specific challenges look like. I would say on the top of the agenda is sex trafficking and I'll just take two things about this the slavery at the peak of the slave trade in the 1780s. they were about 80,000 slaves transported from Africa to the new world. now modern slavery according to State Department rough statistics there are about eight hundred thousand ten times the number that are trafficked across International borders and it does not even include those there traffic within country borders which is a substantial Fortune. and you know if you look at another Factor another contrast a slave back then is worth about $40,000 in today's money. today you can buy a girl traffic for a few hundred dollars which means she's actually more disposable but you know there is progress being made in places like embodia and Thailand we don't have to expect a world where girls are bought and sold for killed. second item on the agenda is maternal mortality you know childbirth in this part of the world is a wonderful event in najare 1 and 7 women can expect to die during childbirth around the world one woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth you know it's not like we don't have the technological solution but these women have three strikes against them they are poor their Rural and they are female. you know every woman who does die there are 20 who survived but end up with an injury and the most devastating injuries this obstetric fistula is a tearing during a suspected labor that leaves a woman incontinent. let me tell you about my abuba she lives in Ethiopia she was married against her will at age 13 she got pregnant ran to the bush to have the baby but you know her body was very immature and she ended up having abstracted labor the baby died and she ended up with a fistula that meant she was incontinent she couldn't control her waist in the word she stink villagers thought she was cursed they didn't know what to do with her so finally they put her at the edge of the village in the Hut they ripped off the door so that the hyenas would get hurt at night. that night it was a stick in the Hut she fought off the hyenas with that stick and the next morning she knew if she could get to a nearby Village where there was a foreign missionary she would be safe because she had some damage to her if she crawled all the way 30 my tooth at the doorstep half-dead the for missionary open the door you would exactly what I would have took her to a nearby Vista Hospital in Addis Ababa and she was repaired with a $350 operation. the doctors and nurses there knows that she was not only a Survivor she was really clever and they made her a nurse so now my booba she is saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of women she has become part of the solution not the problem she's moved out of the Vicious Cycle into a virtuous cycle. the challenges let me talk about some of the solutions and there are predictable Solutions I painted that them education and Economic Opportunity so of course when you educate a girl she tends to get married later on in life she tends to have kids later on in life to tense up your kids and those kids that she does have she educates them in a more enlightened fashion Economic Opportunity it can be transformative let me tell you about the Syma she lives in a small village outside of the heart Pakistan. and at the time she was miserable she was beating every single day by her husband who was unemployed he was kind of a gambler typing unemployable therefore into his frustrations out on her well when she had her second daughter her mother-in-law told her son I think you better get a second wife I was not going to produce you a son. what you had her second daughter. at the time there was a micro Lending Group in the village that day for a $65 loan. Simon took that money and she started an embroidery business. the merchants like to embroidery it sold very well and they kept asking for more and when she couldn't produce enough she hired other women in the village pretty soon she had 30 women in the village working for her embroidery business and then when she had to have transport all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace she needed someone to help her do the transport so she fired her husband so now they're in it together he does the transportation distribution and she does the production and sourcing and now they have a third daughter and the daughters all of them are being tutored and education because Simon knows what's really important which brings me to the final element which is education. Larry Summers when he was Chief Economist at the world bank once said that it may well be that the highest return-on-investment in the developing world is in girls education. let me tell you about the efest bureau Beatrice was living in Uganda near the Congo border and like diamonds you she didn't go to school actually she had never been to school one day. her parents again said you know why should we spend the money on her she's going to spend most of it like lugging water back and forth well that time there was a group in Connecticut called the Niantic Community Church group in Connecticut they made a donation to an organization based in Arkansas called heifer International. have her sent to go to Africa one of them ended up with Beatrice's parents and that had twins between start producing milk they stole them up for cash the cash-starved accumulating and pretty soon parents said you know we got enough money let's send before school so at nine years of age they just started in first grade after all she's ever been to the school with a six-year-old no matter if she was just delighted to be in school she rocketed to the top of her class she stayed at the top of her class through elementary school middle school and then in high school she scored a brilliant lie on the national examinations so that she became the first person in her village ever becomes the United States on scholarship two years ago she graduated from Connecticut College. on the day of her graduation she said I am the luckiest girl alive because of a goat. and that do it was $120 so we see how chance formative little bits of help can be what I want to give you a reality check look. USA. Helping people is not easy and there has been books that are criticized the US AIDS there is at least released book there's a book called Dead Aid and you know the criticism is fair it isn't easy you know people say how half of all water well projects a year later or fail when I was in Zimbabwe we were touring a place with the village teeth you want to raise money for a secondary school and there was some construction a few yards away and I said what's that he sort of mumbled turns out that it's a failed irrigation project few yards away with a failed Chicken Coop when you're all the chickens type no one wants with the chickens in there too but we think that you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater you actually improved you learn from your mistakes and you continuously improve individuals can make a difference and they should because individuals together. we can all help create a movement and a movement of men and women is what's needed to bring about social change change that will address this great moral challenge. Savannah I ask what's in it for you you're probably asking that why should you care. I will just leave you with two things one is that research shows that once you have all of your material needs taken care of which most of us all of us here in this room research shows that there are very few things in life that can actually elevate your level of Happiness one of those things is contributing to a cause larger than yourself. and the second thing it's an anecdote that I'll leave you with and that is the story of an aid worker in Dar fer. here was a woman who had worked in Darfur Seeing Things That No human being should see. throughout her time there she was strong she was steadfast she never broke down. and then she came back to United States and was on break Christmas break choosing her grandmother's backyard and she saw something that made her break down in tears. what that was was a bird feeder. and she realized that she had the great Fortune to be born in a country where we take security for granted what we not only can feed clothe and house ourselves but also provide for wild birds so they don't go hungry in the winter. and she realized that with that great Fortune comes great responsibility and so. like her you may we've all won the lottery of life and so the question becomes how do we discharged that responsibility. so here's the cause join the movement feel happier and help save the world thank you very much",0.6875
StephenPetranek_2002,so what can we do about this oh by the way we're overdue thousand years since this happened so it should have happened about four hundred and eighty thousand years ago oh and here 's one other thing scientists think now our magnetic field may be  maybe we're in the throes of it one of the problems of trying to figure out how healthy the earth is is that we have you know we don't have good weather data from sixty years ago much less data  things like the ozone layer so  there's a fairly simple solution to this there's gonna be a lot of cheap rocketry that's gonna come online in about six or seven years  gets us into the low atmosphere very cheaply you know we can make ozone from car tailpipes it's not hard it's just three oxygen atoms  brought the entire ozone layer down to the surface of the earth it would be the thickness of two pennies at fourteen pounds per square inch you don't need that much up there we need to learn how to repair and replenish the earth 's ozone layer well protecting us from this occasionally we get a flare from the sun that causes havoc with communications and so forth and electricity  but the alarming thing is that astronomers recently have been studying stars that are similar to our sun and they've found that a number of them when they're about the age of our sun  by a factor of as much as twenty doesn't last for very long and they think these are superflares millions of times more  not after this and that got me into a discussion with some other people other scientists about maybe some other subjects and one of the guys i talked to who was a neuroscientist said you know  flares we've had from our sun so  there's a flip side to it in studying stars like our sun we've found that they go through periods of diminishment when total amount of energy that's expelled from them goes down by maybe one percent one percent doesn't sound like a lot but it would cause one hell of an ice age here so what can we do about this  ninety three this is rocket science but it's not hard rocket science everything that we need to make an atmosphere on mars and to make a livable planet on mars is probably there and you just literally have to send little nuclear factories up there that gobble up the iron oxide on the surface of mars and spit out the oxygen the problem is it takes three hundred years to terraform mars minimum really more like five hundred years to do it right there's no reason why a new global epidemic people have been at war with germs ever since there have been people and from time to time the germs sure get the upper hand in we had a flu epidemic in the united states that killed twenty million people that was back when the population was around one hundred million people the bubonic plague in europe in the middle ages killed one  europeans aids is coming back ebola seems to be rearing its head with much too much frequency and old diseases like cholera are becoming all learned what the kind of panic that can occur when an old disease rears its head like anthrax  the worst possibility is that a very simple germ like staph for which we have one antibiotic that still works mutates and we know staph can do amazing things a staph cell can be next to a muscle cell in your body and borrow genes when antibiotics come and change and mutate the danger is that some germ like staph will be will mutate into something that's really very contagious and will sweep through populations before we can do anything about it that's happened before about twelve thousand years ago  there was a massive wave of mammal extinctions in the americas and that is thought to have been a virulent disease so what can we do about it it is nuts we  reminds me of michael 's talk yesterday and his mother saying you can't have a solution the advances that have taken place in astronomy cosmology  every for you it's all farmed you know you gotta ask when you go to a restaurant if it's a wild fish  disease in the united states we are not prepared to cope with it now there is money in the federal budget next year to build up the public health service but i don't think to any extent that it really needs to be done number two my favorite  so we went out looking for solutions to ways that the world might end tomorrow and lo and behold we found and these stars have compressed down to maybe something like twelve fifteen miles wide and they are black holes and they are gobbling up everything around them including light which is why we can't see them most of them should be in orbit around something but galaxies are very violent places and things can be spun out of orbit also space is incredibly vast so even if you flung a million of these things  the chances that one would actually hit us is fairly remote but it only has to get close about a billion miles away about a billion miles away here 's what happens to earth 's orbit it becomes elliptical instead of circular and for three months out of the year the surface temperatures go up to one hundred and fifty to one hundred and eighty for three months again we gotta think about being a colonizing race and finally number one  which leads me to a videotape a really big asteroid heads for  piece of a comet exploded over siberia and flattened forests for maybe one hundred miles it had the effect of four hundred thousand miles away from earth nothing to worry about right it passed directly through earth 's orbit we were in that that spot six hours a small asteroid say a half mile wide would touch off firestorms followed by severe global cooling from the thing an asteroid five miles wide causes major extinctions we think the one that got the dinosaurs was about five miles wide where are they there's something called the kuiper belt which some people think pluto 's not a planet  balls of ice and rock comets really out there that are fifty miles in diameter or more and they regularly take a little spin in towards the sun and pass reasonably close to us of more concern i think is the asteroids that exist between mars and jupiter the folks at the sloan digital sky survey told us last fall they're making the first map of the universe three dimensional map of the universe  so you say yeah well what are really the chances of this this is a chart that doctor clark chapman at the southwestern research institute presented to congress a few years ago you'll  the chance of an asteroid slash comet impact killing you is about one in twenty thousand according to the work they've done now look at the one right below that  passenger aircraft crash one in twenty thousand we spend an awful lot of money trying to be  and we're not spending hardly anything on this and yet this is completely preventable we finally have just in the last year the technology to stop this cold could we have the solutions spending three million dollars a year three million bucks that is like pocket change to search for asteroids because we can actually figure out every asteroid that's out there  it might hit earth and when it might hit earth and they're trying to do that but it's gonna take them ten years at spending three million dollars a year and even then they claim they'll only have about eighty percent of but we would have lots of time if we see it coming we really need a dedicated observatory you'll notice that a lot of comets are named after amateur astronomers that's because nobody 's looking for them except amateurs we need a dedicated observatory that looks for comets part two of the solutions we need to figure out how to blow up an asteroid or alter its trajectory now a year ago we did an amazing thing we sent a probe out to this asteroid belt called near near earth asteroid rendezvous  and these guys orbited a thirty or no about a twenty two mile long asteroid called  two trillion dollar federal budget which will land us back into deficit spending real fast but terrorists aren't the only threat we face there are  but we can learn to land on these asteroids that have our name on them and put something like a small ion propulsion motor on it which would gently slowly after a period of time push it into a different trajectory which if we've done our math right would keep it from hitting earth this is just a matter of finding em going and doing something about it i know your head is spinning from all this stuff so i think to remember is september eleventh we don't wanna get  caught flat footed again we know about this stuff science has the power to predict the future in many cases now knowledge is power the worst thing we can do say jeez i got enough to worry about without worrying about an really serious calamities staring us in the eye that we're in the same kind of denial about that we were about terrorism and what could 've happened on september eleventh i would propose therefore  that if we took ten billion dollars from that two point one three trillion dollar budget which is one or is two one hundred ths of that and biology in the last ten years are really extraordinary to the point where we know more about our universe and how it works than many of you and we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems i'm going to talk to you about the to me these are richard  but i because i think the people in this room can literally change the world i hope you take some of this stuff away with you and when you have an opportunity to try to get some on some of these ideas so let 's start number ten we lose the will we live in an incredible age of modern medicine we are all much healthier than we were  people around the world are getting better medicine but mentally we're falling apart the world health  now estimates that one out of five people on the planet is clinically depressed and the world health organization also says that depression is the biggest epidemic that humankind  soon genetic breakthroughs and even better medicine are going to allow us to think of one hundred as a normal life span a female child born tomorrow on average median will live to age eighty three our life  something like ninety eight percent of all people with depression and i mean really severe  this is a curable disease with present medicine and present technology but it is often a combination talk therapy and pills pills alone don't do it especially in clinically depressed people you ought to be able to go to a or a psychologist and put down your ten dollar co pay and get treated just like you do when you got a cut on your arm it's ridiculous secondly drug companies are not going to develop really sophisticated psychoactive drugs we know that most  mental illnesses have a biological component that can be dealt with and we know just an amazing amount more about the brain now than we did ten years ago we need a pump push from the federal government through nih and national science nsf and places like that to start helping the drug companies develop some advanced psychoactive drugs all of the ones we've found by the way are in this little teeny tiny corner where we live in the milky way  there must be millions of planets in the milky way and as carl sagan insisted for many years and was laughed at for it there must be billions and billions in the universe in a few years nasa is gonna launch four or five telescopes out to jupiter where there's less dust and start looking for earth like planets which we cannot see really is a black hole at the center of every galaxy the science writers and editors i shouldn 't say science writers i should say people who  and probably fairly close to us is a fairly remote idea and the chance that some of it isn't more intelligent than ours is also  a great likelihood i really believe this and i don't believe in aliens but and i a likelihood that we will confront a civilization that is more intelligent than our own now what will  what if they come to you know suck up our oceans for the hydrogen and swat us away like flies the way we  advanced western civilization has had a destructive effect on all primitive civilizations it has come in contact with even in those cases where every attempt was made  to protect and guard the it may seem ridiculous but we have a really lousy history of anticipating things like this and actually being prepared for them how much energy and money does it take to actually have a plan  and editors would sit down over a couple of beers after a hard day of work and start talking about some of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works and to negotiate with an  last forever our sun doesn't last forever if we want humanity to last forever we have to colonize the milky way  a lot if we meet an advanced civilization along the way if we're trying to be an advanced civilization number they said we've been looking at the oceans for a long time now and we wanna tell you they're not in trouble they're near collapse many other ecosystems on earth are in real real danger we're living in a time of mass extinctions that exceeds the fossil record by a factor of ten thousand we have lost twenty five percent of the unique species in hawaii in the last twenty years california is expected to the rain forest collapses as an ecosystem there's really a tree like that out there that's really what it comes to and when that ecosystem collapses  a major ecosystem with it like our atmosphere so what do we do about this what are the solutions  there is some modeling of ecosystems going on now the problem with ecosystems is that we understand them so poorly that they would inevitably end up in what i thought was a very bizarre place which is ways the world could end very suddenly and that's what i we don't know they're really in trouble until it's almost too late we need to know earlier that they're getting in trouble and we need to be able to pump possible solutions into models and with the kind of computing power we have now there is as i say some of this going on but it needs money national science foundation needs to say you know almost all the money that's spent on science in this country comes from the federal government one way or another and they get to prioritize you know there are people at the national science  this is the most important thing this is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about secondly we need to create huge biodiversity reserves on the planet and start moving them around  there's been an experiment for the last four or five years on the georges bank or the grand banks off of newfoundland it's a no take fishing zone they can't fish there for a radius of two hundred miles and an amazing thing you all remember ted kaczynski the unabomber one of the things he raved about was that a particle accelerator experiment could go haywire and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world a lot of very sober minded physicists believe it or not have had exactly the same thought this spring there's a collider at right other collider experiments there's one that's gonna take place next summer at cern have the possibility of creating something called strangelets which are kind of like antimatter whenever they hit other matter they destroy it and  we need the advice of particle physicists to talk about particle physics  but we need some outside thinking and watchdogging of what's going on with these experiments secondly we have a natural laboratory surrounding the earth we have an electromagnetic field around the earth and it's constantly bombarded by high energy particles like protons and we don't in my opinion we don't spend enough time looking at that natural laboratory and figuring out first  that creates its own pesticide to kill a corn borer you may of heard of it heard it called starling they found bt corn genes in wild corn plants now corn originated we think in mexico  this is the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn this brings back a gone away recently that superweeds and superpests could spread around the world from biotechnology that literally could destroy the world 's food so all seemed a little fantastical to me but the starling disaster happened there was a battle between the epa and the fda over who really had authority and over what parts it straightened out for months that's kind of crazy number five  one of my favorites reversal of the earth 's magnetic field believe it or not this happens every few hundred thousand years and has happened many times in our history north pole goes to the south south pole goes to the north and vice versa come streaming at us from the sun that this field protects us from are well basically we're ,"the advances that have taken place in astronomy. cosmology and biology. in the last 10 years are really extraordinary to the point where we know more about our universe and how it works then many of you might imagine but there was something else that I noticed as those changes were taking place as people were starting to find out the other really is a black hole at the center of every science writers and editors I shouldn't say science writers I should say people who write about science. and I would sit down over a couple of beers after a hard day at work and start talking about some of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works and they would inevitably end up in what I thought was a very bizarre place which is ways the world could end very suddenly. and that's what I want to talk about today how you laugh you fools. take me to finish up a little early but yeah. are we need the time that all seems a little Fantastical to me but after challenging a lot of these ideas and I began to take a lot of mysterious and then September 11th have them and I thought I can't go to the Ted conference talk about how the world is going to end nobody wants to hear that and a discussion with some other people of other scientists about maybe some other subjects in one of the guys I talk to is a neuroscientist said. you know I think you're a lot of solutions to the problems you brought up and reminds me of Michaels talked yesterday and his mother saying you can't have a solution if you don't have a problem so we went out looking for solutions to waste that the world might him tomorrow and lo and behold we found them how which leads me to a video tape of President Bush press conference from a couple weeks ago to defend our security. and whatever it cost to defend our freedom. we must pay our Ravens president and he wants to trillion dollars to protect us from terrorists next year to trillion-dollar federal budget which will land us back into deficit spending real fast. but terrorists aren't the only threat we Face there are really serious Calamity staring Us in the eye that were in the same kind of denial about the we were about terrorism and what could have happened on September 11th. I would propose there for. that if we took 10 billion dollars from that 2.13 trillion-dollar budget which is 1 or is it true 100 of that budget. and we build out a billion dollars each one of these problems are going to talk to you about the vast majority could be saw and the rest of us to deal with so I hope you find this fascinating and I'm fascinated by this kind of stuff I got to Richard's cockroaches but I also home. because I think the people in this room can literally change the world I hope you're taking some of the stuff away with you and when you have an opportunity to be influential the to try to get some heavy-duty money spent on some of these ideas so let's start. number to him we lose the will to survive. are we living in an incredible age of modern medicine we are all much healthier than we were twenty years ago people around the world are getting better medicine. but mentally we're falling apart the World Health Organization now has to make that one out of five people on the planet is clinically depressed. and the World Health Organization also says that depression is the biggest epidemic that humankind has ever faced. soon genetic breakthroughs and even better medicine are going to. allow us to think of 100 as a normal lifespan for a female child born tomorrow on average medium will live to age 83 are lighting longevity is going up almost a year for every year that passes not a problem with all of this getting older is the people over 65 are the most likely people to commit suicide. so what are the solutions we don't really have mental health insurance in this country and its. something like 98% of all people with depression really severe depression I have a friend with stunningly severe depression. this is a curable disease with present medicine and present technology but it is often a combination of talk therapy and pills pills alone don't do it especially in clinically depressed people you want to be able to go to a psychiatrist and a psychologist and put down your $10 copay and get treated just like you do when you got to cut on your ridiculous secondly. drug companies and not going to develop a really sophisticated psychoactive drugs we know that most mental illnesses have a biological component that can be dealt with and we know just an amazing amount more about the brain now than we did ten years ago we need a pump push from the federal government through ni Asian National intercept and places like that to start helping the drug companies developed in the band psychoactive drugs. moving on number 9 by 10 years ago you couldn't have found an astronomer well very few of coronavirus in the world who would have told you that there any planets anywhere outside our solar system 1995 we found three the count now is up to 80 we're finding about two or three a month. all of the ones who found by wearing this little teeny tiny corner where we live in the Milky Way there must be millions of planets in the Milky Way and is Carl Sagan insisted for many years and was left at 4. There must be billions and billions and the universe in a few years for 5 telescopes out the Jupiter what is less dust and start looking for a flight plan by which we cannot see with present technology nor detect. it's becoming obvious that the chance that life does not exist elsewhere in the universe than probably fairly close to us has a fairly remote idea and a chance to some of it isn't more intelligent than ours is also a remote idea. remember we've only been an advanced civilization of an industrial civilization if you would for 200 years although every time I go to pump am amazed that they had the equivalent of a McDonald's on every street corner too so I don't know how much civilization really has progressed since 1879 but has a great likelihood I really believe this and I don't believe in aliens but I don't believe there any aliens on anything like that but there's a likelihood that we will confront a civilization that is more intelligent than our own. once they come to you know. stock up our oceans for the hydrogen and swallow us away like flies away with SWAT away flies when I get into the rainforest and start loving it we can look at our own history the late physicist Gerard O'Neill said. Advanced Western Civilization has had a destructive effect on all primitive civilizations that has come in contact with even in those cases where every attempt was made to protect and guard the Primitive civilization if the aliens come visiting where the Primitive civilization. so what are the solutions does.thank God you can already. it may seem ridiculous but we have a really lousy history of anticipating things like this and actually being prepared for them how much energy and money does it take to actually have a plan to negotiate with an advanced species. secondly and you're going to hear more from me about this we have to become an outward-looking spacefaring Nation we have got to develop the idea that the Earth doesn't last forever our son doesn't last forever if we want Humanity to last forever we have to colonize are the Milky Way and that is not something that is beyond comprehension at this point.will also help us a lot of advanced civilization on the way if we're trying to be an advanced civilization number eight you got it you've got the job at the journal science 19 oceanographers very very unusual article wasn't really a recent research report it was this free they said we've been looking at the ocean for a long time now and we want to tell you they not in trouble there near collapse many other ecosystems on Earth are in real real danger we are living in a time of mass extinctions that exceeds the fossil record by a factor of ten thousand we have lost 25% of the unique species in Hawaii in the last 20 years in California is expected to lose 25% of its species in the next 40 years somewhere. how far is the marginal tree the rainforest ecosystem there's really a tree like that out there that's really what it comes to medical system for a refill system with it. there is some modeling of ecosystems going on now but the problem with ecosystems is that we understand them so poorly that we don't know they're really in trouble until it's almost too late we need to know earlier that they're getting in trouble and we need to be able to pump possible solutions in two models and it with the kind of computing power we have now there is as I say some of us going on but it needs money National Science Foundation needs to say you know almost all the money to spend on science and the priorities you know if there are people at the National Science Foundation get to say this is the most important thing is the one who thinks they ought to be thinking more about secondly we need to create huge biodiversity reserves on the planet and start moving them around probably has been an experiment for the last 45 years on the Georges Bank for the grand Banks of Newfoundland there for a radius of 200 miles. something is happening almost all the fish come back and they reproducing like crazy we're going to have to start doing this around to go over to have to have no take Zone we're going to have to say no more logging in the Amazon for 20 years later recovering before we start walking again. number 7 particle accelerator Milsap about was that a particle accelerator experiment to go haywire and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world a lot of very sober-minded physicists believe it or not I've had exactly the same thought this spring and there's a collider at Brookhaven on Long Island this prank it's going to have an experiment in which is created black holes they are expecting to create a little tiny black holes they expect them to evaporate I hope the right has one that's going to take place next summer at the CERN have the possibility of creating something called a strange lips which I kind of like Andy matter whenever they hit the other matter they destroy it and obliterate it powerful enough to create black hole. call Sam strange look so we need to worry about and they're probably right but all around the world in Japan and Canada there's talk about this new night of Reviving this in the United States we shot one down it was going to be big but then there's talk of building very big accelerators what can we do about this but it's Solutions. we need the advice of particle physicist to talk about particle physics and what can be done in particle physics but we need some outside thinking and watch doggin of what's going on with the experiment secondly we have a natural laboratory surrounding the earth we have an electromagnetic field around the earth and it's constantly bombarded by high-energy particles like protons and we don't hide in my opinion we don't spend enough time looking at that at the laboratory and figuring out what's safe to do on Earth. number to biotech disaster it's one of my favorite ones cuz we've done several stories on BT corn BT corn is a corn creates its own pesticide to kill a corn borer if you may have heard of it to her to call the Starlight especially when all the taco shells or taken off the supermarket out of the supermarket's about a year-and-a-half ago was supposed to only be a feed for animals in the United States in a gun into the human food supply and somebody should have figured out that it would get any humans to fly there is a but the thing it's alarming as a couple months ago in Mexico where BT corn oil genetically altered form is totally illegal. they found BT corn machine in Wild corn plants now corn originated with ink in Mexico this is the store this is the genetic biodiversity Storehouse of corn this brings back a skepticism that has gone away recently that super we've been super pass could have spread around the world from biotechnology that literally could destroy the world food supply in very short order. so what do we do about that. we treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we applied a nuclear power plants this is an amazingly unregulated field when the starlink disaster happened there was a battle between eea and efta over who really had a 30 and over what parts of it and then he get a straight enough from us that's kind of crazy. number five one of my favorites reversal of the Earth's magnetic field believe it or not this happens every few hundred thousand years and is that many times in our history North but what happens as soon as this occurs is the we lose our magnetic field around the earth that a over a period of about a hundred years and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles that are come streaming in us from the Sun that this field protects us from our well basically we're going to fry. so what can we do about this oh by the way we're overdue and 780000 years since this happened so it should have happened about 480000 years ago I think now that are magnetic field may be diminished by about 5%. so maybe maybe we're in the throes of it. one of the problems of it trying to figure out how healthy the Earth is cuz we have you know we don't have good weather data from 60 years ago much less data on our things like the ozone layer so. there's a fairly simple solution to this there is going to be a lot of cheap rocketry that's going to come online in about six or seven years into the lower atmosphere very cheaper you know we can make calzone from car tailpipe it's not hard it's just three oxygen atoms if you brought the entire ozone layer down to the surface of the Earth it would be the thickness of two pennies at 14 pounds per square inch you don't need that much up there we need to learn how to repair and replenish the Earth ozone layer. number for Giant solar flares magnetic outbursts from the Sun to bombard the Earth with high-speed some atomic particles sphere is done and our magnetic field has done pretty well protecting us from this occasionally we get a player from the Sun that causes Havoc with Communications and so forth and electricity but the alarm and sing as the astronomers recently have been studying stars that are similar to our sun and they found that a number of them when they're about the age of our son brighten by a factor of 20 doesn't last for very long and they think he's are super clear millions of times more powerful than any players we had for my son so far. obviously we don't want one of those. there's a flip side to it and selling stars like our sun we found that they go through periods of diminishment when there are total amount of energy that has expelled him and goes down by Meghan 1% 1% doesn't sound like a lot of here so what can we do about this. does one of my favorite subjects I wrote a story about this in Life magazine in 1993 this is rocket science but it's not hard rock at science everything that we need to make an atmosphere on Mars to make it livable planet on Mars if he's probably there and you're just literally have to send little nuclear factories up there that gobble up the Ironside on the surface of Mars and spit out the oxygen the problem is it takes 300 to terraform Mars minimum really more like five hundred years to do it right there's no reason why we shouldn't start now. number three. Tesla stock quote I knew Global epidemic people have been at war with germs ever since there have been people and from time-to-time the germs sure get the upper hand in 1918 are we had a flu epidemic in the United States that killed twenty million people that was back when the population was around 100 million people Bubonic plague in Europe in the Middle Ages kill one out of four Europeans AIDS is coming back as a bowl of seems to be in rearing its head with much too much frequency and old diseases like cholera are becoming resistant to antibiotics. we've all learned what the kind of panic that can occur when an old disease Reyes its head like a tracks. the worst possibility is that a very simple germ like staff for which we have one antibiotic but still works. music and we know staff can do amazing things the staff cell can be next to a muscle cell in your body and borrow jeans from it when antibiotics come and change and new take the dangerous to some germ like staff will be will mutate into something is really here on very contagious and will sweep through populations before we can do anything about it even before about twelve thousand years ago there was a massive wave of male extinctions in the Americas and that is thought to have been a barrel of disease so what can we do about it. it is nice we give antibiotics. every cow every lamb every chicken to get anybody to Cleary day I'll let you know you go to restaurant do you know you got to ask when you go to restaurant if it's a wild fish cuz they're not going to tell you we're giving away the code it's like being at War and giving somebody your secret code we're telling the germs out there how to fight it. we have text I forgot an outlaw that right away secondly our public health system as we saw the damn traffic is a real disaster we have we have a real major outbreak of disease in the United States we are not prepared to cope with them now there is money in the federal budget next year to build up with the public health service but I don't think to any extent that really needs to be done. number to my favorite we meet a real black hole 10 years ago and you said you know there's probably a black hole at the center of every galaxy in the off the stage and now he went into one of those conventions and you said I don't think black holes are out there they do talk to Stage our comprehension of the way the universe works is really up is we just gained unbelievably in recent years we think that there are about ten million dead stars in the Milky Way alone our galaxy and the rest of compressed down to maybe something like 12 15 miles wide and they are black holes and they are gobbling up everything around them including light which is why we can't see them. most of them should be in orbit around something but galaxies are very violent places and things can be spun out of orbit and also space is incredibly fast so even a few million of these things out of orbit by the chances the one would actually hit us is fairly remote. it only has to get it only has to get close about A Million Miles Away one of these things and the three months out of the year the surface temperatures go up to 150 to 180 for three months out of the year to go to 50 below zero that won't work too well what can we do about this this is my scariest again I got to think about being a colonizing race and finally number one biggest danger to Life as we know it I think a really big asteroid headed for Earth. the important thing to remember here at this is not a question of if this is a question of when and how big in 1908 just a 200 ft piece of a, exploded over Siberian flat in the forest for maybe a hundred miles I had the effect of about a thousand Russian Obama astronomers estimate that little after I'd like that, about every hundred years in 1989 a large asteroid passed four hundred thousand miles away from her nothing to worry about right if passed directly to Earth's orbit we were in that spot 6 hours early. a small asteroid say a half-mile wide wood touch up firestorms followed by severe global cooling from the debris kicked up Carl Sagan's nuclear winter thing an asteroid Five Mile Line causes major extinctions would think the one that got the dinosaurs was about five miles why some people think Pluto's not a planet that's why Pluto is it's in the Cooper belt there's also something a little farther out all the Oort cloud there about 100,000 balls of ice and rock, it's really out there that are 50 miles in diameter or more and they regularly take a little spin in towards the sun in. pass reasonably close to us I'm more concerned I think is the asteroids to exist between Mars and Jupiter the folks at the Sloan digital Sky survey told us last fall they making the first map of the universe three-dimensional map of the universe asteroids between Mars and Jupiter that are a half a mile big or bigger. so you say yeah well what a really the chances of this happening and her can you put that shirt on this is a chart that doctor Clark chaplains the southwestern Research Institute presented to Congress a few years ago, impact killing you was about one in twenty thousand going to the work they've done now look at the one right below that passenger aircraft crash one in 20,000 we spend an awful lot of money. Trying to be sure that we don't die in an airplane accident and we're not spending hardly anything on this any of this is completely preventable we finally have just in the last year the technology to stop this cold so we have the solution. massive spending three million dollars a year 3 million bucks that has like pocket change to search for asteroids because we can actually figure out every asteroid that's out there and hit my head hurts and when might hit Earth and they're trying to do that but it's going to take him 10 years that's pending $3000000 here and even then they claim they'll only have about 80% of them catalog, topper asked we don't really have the technology to predict, trajectories and when one with our name on it might arrive but we would have lots of time if we if we see it coming we really need a dedicated Observatory you'll notice it a lot of comments are named after people you never heard of amateur astronomers that says nobody's looking for him except the only truth we need a dedicated Observatory good looks for Conns. part two of the solutions we need to figure out how to blow up an asteroid or alter its trajectory now a year ago we did amazing thing we sent a probe out to this asteroid belt told near near Earth asteroid Rendezvous and these guys orbited a 30 or a but not about a 22 Mile Long asteroid called Heroes and then of course you know they pulled one of those sneaking out something for that extra batteries and extra gas aboard and everything and that the last minute thing land when the mission was over they actually landed on the thing. we have landed a rocket ship on an asteroid it's not a big deal now the trouble with just sending a bomb out for this thing is that you don't have anything to push against in space cuz there's no are the nuclear explosions just as hot but we don't really have anything big enough to melt a 22 Mile on a right or vaporize it would be more like it but we can learn to land on this asteroid could have her name on them and put something like a small ion propulsion motor on it which would gently slowly after. Of time I'll push it into a different trajectory which if we've done our Mass rather we can keep it from hitting Earth this is just a matter of finding them going there and doing something done. I know your head is spinning from all this stuff. nothing I think the remember September 11th we don't want to get caught flat-footed again we know about this stuff science has the power to predict the future in many cases now the worst thing we can do. is say cheese I got enough to worry about without worrying about an asteroid. that's Anastasia could literally cost us our future thank you",0.6953125
JohnDoerr_2007,i can't wait to see what we tedsters do about this crisis and i really really hope that we multiply all of our energy all of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem we must act and we must act decisively i've got to tell you for me everything changed that evening and so my partners and i we set off on this mission if we do i can look forward to the conversation i'm going to have with my daughter  to learn more to try to do much more so we mobilized we got on airplanes we went to brazil we went to china and to india for this climate crisis we assembled a network really of superstars from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs and business leaders fifty or so of them and so i want to tell you about what we've learned in doing that and four lessons i've learned in the last year the first lesson is that companies are really powerful and that matters a lot i'm really scared  this is a story about how wal mart went green and what that means two years ago the ceo lee scott  that green is the next big thing and so wal mart made going green a top priority they committed that they're going to take their existing stores and reduce their energy consumption by twenty percent and their new stores by thirty percent and do all that in seven years i don't think we're going to make it  the three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating and air conditioning then lighting and then refrigeration so look what they did they painted the roofs of all their stores white they put smart skylights through their stores so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands and third they put the refrigerated goods behind closed doors with led lighting i mean why would you try to refrigerate a whole store  these are really simple smart solutions based on existing technology why does wal mart matter well it's massive have one of the world 's most amazing supply chains sixty thousand suppliers if wal mart were a country it would be the sixth largest trading partner with china most important they have a big effect on other companies when wal mart declares it's going to go green and be profitable it has a powerful impact on other great institutions so let me tell you this when wal mart achieves twenty percent energy reductions that's going to be a very big deal but i'm afraid it's not enough we need wal mart and every other company to do the same the second thing that we learned is that individuals matter and they matter enormously i've got another wal mart story for you wal mart has over one hundred and twenty five million u s customers that's a third of the u s population sixty five million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year and wal mart has committed they're going to sell another one hundred million light bulbs in the coming year  but the pay off is really enormous one hundred million compact fluorescent light bulbs means that we'll save six hundred million dollars in energy bills and twenty million tons of co two every year year in and year out  it does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing it is stupid that we use two tons of steel glass and plastic to haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall it's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles in fiji and ship it here it's hard to change consumer behavior because you know how much co two you generated to drive here or fly here i don't know and i should those of us who care about all this would act better if we knew what the real costs were but as long as we pretend that co two is free as long as these uses are nearly invisible how can we expect change i'm really afraid because i think the kinds of changes we can reasonably expect from individuals a real problem we've got a climate crisis so we went around the table to talk about what we should do are going to be clearly not enough the third lesson we learned is that policy matters it really matters in fact policy is paramount hand he stood up you know bob 's that berkeley techie type who started sybase  well bob said the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in sacramento california that we need a market based system of mandates that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in california it's necessary and just as important it's good for the california economy so  thank you i think it's the most important legislation of two thousand and six why the conversation came to my fifteen year old daughter mary she said i agree with everything that's been he told us that brazil 's government mandated that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol and they mandated that their new vehicles would be flex fuel compatible right they'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline and so here 's what's happened in brazil they now have twenty nine thousand ethanol pumps seven hundred in the u s and a paltry two in california and in three years their new car fleet has gone from four percent to eighty five percent flex fuel  compare that to the u s five percent are flex fuel and you know what i'm scared and i'm angry didn't ship to the middle east it's created a million jobs inside that country and it's saved thirty two million tons of co two it's really substantial that's ten percent of the co two emissions across their entire country but brazil 's only one point three percent of the world 's in fact i'm afraid all of the best policies we have are not going to be enough the fourth and final lesson we've learned  and then she turned to me and said dad your generation created this problem you'd better fix it is about the potential of radical innovation so i want to tell you about a tragic problem and a breakthrough technology every year a million and a half people die of a completely preventable disease that's malaria six thousand people a day all for want of two dollars worth of medications that we can buy at the corner drugstore well two dollars two dollars too much for africa so a team of berkeley researchers with fifteen million dollars from the gates foundation is engineering designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient called to make that drug ten times cheaper and in doing so they'll save a million lives at least a million lives a year a million lives their breakthrough technology is synthetic biology this leverages millions of years of evolution by redesigning bugs to make really useful products now what you do is you get inside the microbe you change its metabolic pathways and now formed a company called amyris and this technology that they're using can be used to make better biofuels let me skip over that better biofuels are a really big deal that means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain and optimize them along the way so if all goes well they're going to have designer bugs in warm vats that are all the conversation stopped and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels i guess that's better living through bugs alan kay is famous for saying the best way to predict the future is to invent it and of course at kleiner we kind of apologize and say the second best way is to finance it and that's why we're investing all the eyes turned to me two hundred million dollars in a wide range of really disruptive new technologies for innovation in green technologies and we're encouraging others to do it as well we're talking a lot about this i'm really afraid  we need much much more you didn't know that there's enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply america 's energy needs for the next thousand years that we are not investing more in energy research in this country and i am really afraid that it's absolutely not enough i didn't know what to so in a year 's worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises who would have thought that a mass retailer could make money by going green who would have thought that a database entrepreneur could transform california with legislation who would have thought that the and who would have thought that all that is not enough  not enough to stabilize the climate not enough to keep the ice in greenland from crashing into the ocean the scientists tell us and they're only guessing that we've got to reduce  and so somehow we're going to have to find the political will to do this all around the world the wild card in this deck is china to size the problem china 's co two emissions today are three point three gigatons the u s is five point  business as usual means we'll have twenty three gigatons from china by two thousand and fifty that's about as much co two as there is in the whole world and if it's business as usual we're going out of business when i was in davos china 's mayor of dalian was pressed about their co two strategy and he said the following you know then he asked why should china sacrifice our growth so that the west can continue to be profligate and stupid we've reached that time so that all people and all nations tell you what green technologies going green is bigger than the internet it could be the biggest economic opportunity of the twenty one st century moreover if we succeed it's going to be the most important transformation for life on the planet since as bill joy says we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere now here 's the hard question if the trajectory we cannot afford to underestimate this problem  of all the world 's companies and individuals and policies and innovation is not going to be enough what are we going to do  everyone here cares about changing the world and has made a difference in that one way or another so our call to action my call to you is for you to make going green you can personally get carbon neutral go to climatecrisis org or carboncalculator com and buy carbon credits you could join other leaders in  mandating lobbying for mandated cap and trade in u s greenhouse gas reductions there's six bills right now in congress let 's get one of we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences the most important thing you can do i think is to use your personal power and your rolodex to lead your business your institution going green do it like wal mart get it to go green for its customers and its suppliers and for itself really think outside the box can you imagine what it would be like if amazon or ebay or google or microsoft or apple really went green and you caused that to happen ,"I'm really scared. I don't think we're going to make it. probably by now most of you have seen allegories amazing talk shortly after I saw that we had some friends over for dinner with the family. the conversation turned to global warming and everybody agreed. there's a real problem we've got a climate crisis so we went around the table to talk about what we should do. the conversation came to my fifteen-year-old daughter Mary. she said and I agree with everything that's been said. I'm scared and I'm angry and then she turned to me and said dad your generation created this problem you better fix it. wow. all the conversation stopped all the eyes turned to me. I didn't know what to say. Kleiner second laws there is a time when Panic is the appropriate response and we've reached that time. we cannot afford to underestimate this problem. if we Face irreversible and catastrophic consequences we must act and we must act decisively I got to tell you for me everything changed that evening this is my partners and I we set off on this mission to learn more than to try to do much more so Wee mobile I forgot on airplane so we went to Brazil we went to China and India to Bentonville Arkansas to Washington DC in the Sacramento and so what I'd like to do now is tell you about what we've learned in those Journeys because the more we learned the more concerned we crew and I were compulsive networkers and so when we see a big problem or an opportunity like avian flu or personalized medicine we just get together the smartest people we know. for this climate crisis we assembled in network Realty of superstars from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs and Business Leaders fifty or so of them and so I want to tell you about what we've learned in doing that and four lessons I've learned in the last year the first lesson is that companies are really powerful and that matters a lot. this is a story about how Walmart went green and what that means two years ago the CEO at least got to leave the green is the next big thing going green a top priority they committed that they're going to take their existing stores and reduce their energy consumption by 20% and their new stores by 30% and do all that in seven years. the three biggest uses of energy in a store or heating and air conditioning been Lighting in the refrigeration so look at they did they painted the roots of all of their stores White. they put smart skylights through their stores so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands and third they put the refrigerated Goods behind closed doors with LED lighting I mean why would you refrigerate a whole store these are really simple smart Solutions based on existing technology why does Walmart matter well it's massive there's a largest private employer in America are the largest private user of electricity they have the second largest vehicle Fleet on the road they have one of the world's most amazing Supply chains 60,000 suppliers if Walmart were a country it would be the sixth largest trading partner with China and maybe most important they have a big effect on other companies when Walmart to Claire's it's going to go green and be profitable it has a powerful impact on other great institutions. can I tell you this when Walmart Chief 20% energy reduction sets going to be at very big deal. but I'm afraid it's not enough we need Walmart and every other company to do the same. the second thing that we learned is sick individuals matter and they matter in Norma sleep I've got other Walmart story for you okay Walmart has over 125 million u.s. customs of the US population. 65 million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year. and Walmart has committed they're going to sell another hundred million light bulbs in the coming year. but it's not easy consumers don't really like these light bulbs the lights kind of funny that won't dim takes awhile for them to start up with a payoff is really enormous 100 million compact fluorescent light bulbs means that will save six hundred million dollars in energy bills in 20 million tonnes of CO2 every year you're in and you're out. it does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing it is stupid that we use two tons of steel glass and plastic to haul our sorry selves for the shopping mall. it's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles in Fiji and ship it here. it's hard to change consumer Behavior because. consumers don't know how much this stuff cost do you know do you know how much CO2 you generated to drive here or fly here. I don't know and I should. those of us who care about all this would act better if if we knew what the real costs were kept it as long as we pretend that CO2 is free how come you can't change I'm really afraid because I think the kinds of changes we can reasonably expect from individuals are going to be clearly not enough. the third lesson we learned just hit policy matters did really matters in fact policy of Paramount. I got a behind-the-scenes story for you about that green check Network I described at the end of our first meeting we got together to talk about what the action items would be how we follow up and Bob Epstein brace to hand he stood up you know Bob set the Berkeley techie type who started sybase obob said the most important thing we can do right now is to make it clear in Sacramento California that we need a market-based system of mandates that's going to cap and reduced greenhouse gases in California. it's necessary and just as important it's good for the California economy so eight of us went to Sacramento in August and we met with the seven undecided legislators and we've lobbying for ab32 you know what six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill so it passed and it passed by a vote of 47 to 32.thank you I think it's the most important legislation of 2006 why because California was the first state in this country to mandate 25% reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 and the result of that is we're going to generate eighty-three thousand new jobs for billion dollars a year in annual income and reduce the CO2 emissions by 174 million tons. California. only 7% of us CO2 emissions it's only a percent and a half of the country CO2 emissions it's a great start but I got to tell you where I started I'm really afraid. in fact I'm certain California's not enough. here's a story about National policy that we could all learn from says if you don't go you don't know well we went to Brazil to meet dr. Jose Goldenberg he's the father of the ethanol Revolution he told us that Brazil's government mandated that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol and they mandated their new vehicles would be flex-fuel compatible right they'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline and so here's what's happened in Brazil they now have twenty-nine thousand effing all pumps that's vs700 in the US and a paltry 2 in California and in three years are new car plate has gone from 4% to 85% flex fuel. compare that to the US 5% or flex-fuel you know what most consumers who have them don't even know it. so what's happening Brazil if they replace 40% of the gasoline consumed by their Automotive Fleet without ethanol that's 59 billion dollars since 1975 but they didn't ship to the Middle East has created a million jobs inside that country and is safe 32 million tonnes of CO2 it's really substantial that's 10% of the CO2 emissions across their entire country. but Brazil's only 1.3% of the world CO2 emission. so Brazil's ethanol Miracle I'm really afraid it's not enough. in fact I'm afraid all of the best policies we have are not going to be enough. the fourth and final lesson we learn is about the potential of radical Innovation so I want to tell you about a tragic problem and a breakthrough technology every year a million and a half people die of a completely preventable diseases such as malaria at six thousand people a day. all for one of $2 worth of medication so we can buy at the Corner Drug store with two dollars $2 is too much for Africa so a team of Berkeley researchers with 15 million dollar man Gates Foundation is engineering designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient called artemisinin. they're going to make that drug ten times cheaper and in doing so they'll save a million lights at least a Million Lives a year A Million Lives. their breakthrough technology is synthetic biology this leverages millions of years of evolution by redesigning bugs to make really useful products what you do is get inside the microbe you changes metabolic pathways and you end up with a living chemical Factory and you may ask John but not formed a company called Amorous in this technology that they're using can be used to make better biofuels. don't let me skip over that better by a fuse or a really big deal that means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain and optimize them along the way so if all goes well they're going to have designer bugs in warm bats that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete that are biofuels I guess that's a Better Living Through bugs. gallon case famous for saying the best way to predict the future is to invent it and Corset Kleiner we kind of apologize and say the second best way is to finance it and that's two hundred million dollars in a wide range of really disruptive new technologies for innovation in green technologies and we're encouraging others to do it as well we're talking a lot about this in 2005 there was six hundred million dollars invested in new technologies of the sort you see here it doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars. but I'm really afraid we need much much more. for reference Fact one exxon's revenues in 2005 were a billion dollars a day you know they only invested 2% of revenues and R&D second fact the president's new budget for renewable energy is barely a billion dollars in total. less than one day of exxon's revenues. perfect I bet you didn't know that there's enough energy in Hot Rocks Under the country to supply America's energy needs for the next Thousand Years. in the federal budget calls for a measly 20 million dollars of our Indy in geothermal energy it is almost criminal that we are not investing more in Energy Research in this country and I'm really afraid that it's absolutely not enough. 20 years worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises who would have thought that a mass retailer could make money by going green who would have thought that a database entrepreneur could transform California with legislation who would have thought that the ethanol biofuel Miracle would come from a developing country in South America and who would have thought that scientist trying to cure malaria could come up with breakthroughs and biofuels. who would have thought that all that is not enough. not enough to stabilize the climate not enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean the scientist tell us and they're only guessing that we got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1/2 and do a fast as possible now we may have the political will to do this in the US but I got to tell you we've got only one atmosphere. so somehow we're going to have to find a political will to do this all around the world. the wild-card in this deck is China the size of the problem China CO2 emissions today are 3.3 gigatons us is 5.8. business as usual means we'll have 23 digit times from China by 2050 that's about as much CO2 as there is in the whole world and if it's business as usual we're going out of business when I was in da Lian was pressed about their CO2 strategy and he said the following you know Americans you seven times of CO2 per capita is Chinese then he asked why should China sacrifice our growth so that the West can continue to be profligate and stupid is anybody here have an answer for him I don't. we got to make this economic so that all people and All Nations. make the right outcome the probable outcome and therefore the likely outcome Energy's is 6 trillion-dollar business worldwide it is the mother of all markets remember that internet. I'll tell you what green technologies going green is bigger than the internet it could be the biggest Economic Opportunity of the 21st century moreover if we succeed it's not going to be the most important transformation for life on the planet since his bill Joyce says we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere. here's the hard question if the trajectory of all the world companies and individuals in policies and Innovation is not going to be enough what are we going to do. I don't know. everyone here cares about changing the world and it made a difference in that one way or another. so I called the action my call to you is for you to make going green your next big thing your gig. what can you do. you can personally get carbon neutral at go to the time at crisis.org Carbon calculator.com and buy carbon credits you could join other leaders in mandating lobby for mandated cap-and-trade and US greenhouse gas reductions there six bills right now in Congress let's get one of them passed. the most important thing you could do I think is to use your personal power and your Rolodex that leads your business or your institution in going green do it like Walmart get it to go green for its customers and its suppliers and for itself. really think outside the box can you imagine what it would be like if Amazon or Ebay or Google or Microsoft or apple really went green and you caused that to happen. it could be bigger than Walmart. I can't wait to see what we testers do about this crisis and I really really hope that we multiply all of our energy all of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem. because if we do I can look forward to a conversation I'm going to have with my daughter in 20 years. traffic is a global epidemic traffic is creating 45% of a while to air pollution in the UK time wasted in traffic cost twenty billion a year would you play for clean the round of the Falls to commute Stockholm put it to a vote for it. how to do something install come to improve the environment and to get the better of a flow in the traffic will put a price on taking your car into the center part of stock on a cold that congestion charges. if you stop a system that system doesn't work on the first day then you will be in big trouble if not the perfect from Davon. there are teaching them tickets to the city each is equipped with cameras on the rear and front license plates these pictures are sent to Central system that identifies the license plates and make sure that the right person pays for the right passages to read the license plate we went out IBM's Global organization and the R&D centres and find a very good software we could use a weight management Limited in two months time going to 9% of old pictures are correct identified. Northside this is how it should be all the time you can see the traffic of the truck is 6 p.m. before we have the congestion charge in the traffic was chewing up at this time of day it is I think it's a good idea because I think that we should it take care of the environment and the CD was about fourteen percent better that is huge International interest from different parts of the world from the United States from Latin America from China and its really pretty sure to tell people no proper planning to do what we're actually have done install come she is not thinking like me for. the future I'm thinking for the children and their grandchildren",0.75390625
RozSavage_2010Z,but that attitude that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb or take your reusable coffee mug that is what could change the world i really believe that we stand at a very important point in history we have a choice we've been blessed or cursed with free will we can choose a greener future and we can get there if we all pull together take it one well i don't know what you're thinking but i'm talking about the beards and no matter how long i spend on the ocean i haven't yet managed to muster a decent beard and i hope that it remains that way for a long time i didn't believe that i could have a big adventure the story that i told myself was that adventurers looked like this i didn't look the part i thought there were them and there were us and i was not one of them and i think i knew from day one that it wasn't the right job for me but that kind of conditioning just kept me there for so many years until i reached my mid thirties and i thought you know i'm not getting any younger i feel like i've got a purpose in this life and i don't know what it is but i'm pretty certain that management consultancy is not  fast forward a few years i'd gone through some changes to try and answer that question of what am i supposed to be doing with my life i sat down one day and wrote two versions of my my name is roz savage and i row across oceans four years ago i rowed solo across the atlantic and since then i've done two out of three stages across the pacific the one that i wanted a life of adventure and the one that i was actually heading for which was a nice normal pleasant life but it wasn't where i wanted to be by the end of my life i wanted to live a life that i could be proud of and i remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking  boy i'm on totally the wrong track here if i carry on living as i am now i'm just not going to end up where i want to be in five years or ten years or at the end of my life i made a few changes let loose a few trappings of my old life and through a bit of a leap of logic decided to row across the atlantic ocean the atlantic rowing race runs from the canaries to antigua it's about three thousand miles and it turned out to be the hardest thing i had ever done and my timing was not great either two thousand and five when i did the atlantic was the year of hurricane katrina there were more all four of my oars broke before i reached halfway across oars are not supposed to look like this but what can you do you're in the middle of the ocean oars are your only means of propulsion so i just had to look around the boat and figure out what i was going to use to fix up these oars so that i could carry on so i found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape and splintered the boat hook to the oars to reinforce it  then when that gave out i sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat and used those and when those gave out i cannibalized one of the broken oars just in how many ways i went beyond what i thought were my limits i suffered from tendinitis on my shoulders and saltwater sores on my i really struggled psychologically totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge realizing that if i carried on  at two miles an hour three thousand miles was going to take me a very very long time there were so many times when i thought i'd hit that limit but had not choice but to just carry on and try and figure out how i was going to get to the other side without driving myself crazy and eventually after one hundred and three days at sea i arrived in antigua i don't think i've ever felt so happy in my entire life like finishing a marathon and getting out of solitary confinement and winning an oscar all rolled into one i was euphoric and to see all the people coming out to greet me and standing along the clifftops and clapping and cheering like a movie star it was absolutely wonderful and i really learned then that the bigger the challenge the bigger the sense of achievement when you get to the end of it so this might by a good moment to take a quick time out to answer a few faqs about ocean rowing that might be going through your mind number one that i get asked what do you eat a few freeze dried meals but mostly i try and eat much more unprocessed foods  so i grow my own beansprouts i eat fruits and nut bars a lot of nuts and generally arrive about thirty lbs lighter at the other end on a good night i think my best ever was eleven miles in the right direction worst ever thirteen miles in the wrong direction that's a bad day at the office a baseball cap rowing gloves and a smile or a frown depending on whether i went backwards overnight and lots do i have a chase boat no i don 't i am totally self supporting out there i don't see anybody for the whole time that i'm at sea generally and so how do you top rowing across the atlantic well naturally you decide to row across the pacific well i'd thought the atlantic was big but the pacific is really really big i think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps i don't know for sure that the brits invented this particular view of the world but i suspect we might have done because there we are right in the middle this is how the pacific looks it pretty much covers half the planet you can just see a little bit of north america up here and a sliver of australia down there it is really big sixty five million square miles and to row in a straight line across it would be about eight thousand miles  the first attempt didn't go so well in two thousand and seven i did a rather involuntary capsize drill three times in twenty four hours a bit like being in a washing machine got a bit dinged up so did i i blogged about it unfortunately somebody with a bit of a hero complex decided this damsel was in distress and needed saving i knew about this was when the coast guard plane turned up over head i tried to tell them to go away we had a bt of a battle of wills i lost and got airlifted awful really awful it was one of the worst feelings of my life as i was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter and looked down at my trusty little boat rolling around in the twenty ft waves and wondering if i would ever see her again this has given me a very special relationship with the ocean we have a bit of a love hate thing going on so i had to launch a very expensive salvage operation and then wait another nine months before i could get back out onto the ocean again  but what do you do fall down nine times get up ten so the following year i set out and fortunately this time made it safely across to hawaii but it was not without misadventure my water maker broke only the most important piece of kit that i have on the boat  panels it sucks in saltwater and turns it into freshwater but it doesn't react very well to being immersed in ocean which is what happened to it  that area in the north pacific about twice the size of texas with an estimated three point five milion tons of trash in it circulating at the center of that north pacific so to make the point these guys had actually built their boat out of plastic trash fifteen thousand empty water bottles lashed together into two pontoons  they were going very slowly partly they'd had a bit of a delay they'd had to pull in at catalina island shortly after they left long beach because the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone and they were starting to sink so  it like i did about a very strict maths teacher that i once had at school i didn't always like her but i did respect her and she taught me a heck of a lot had to pull in and do all the lids up but as i was approaching the end of my water reserves and it took about a week for us to actually gradually converge i was doing a pathetically slow speed of about one point three knots and they were doing only marginally less pathetically speed of about one point four it was like two snails in a mating dance  and this is really bad news because plastic is not an inert substance it leaches out chemicals into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it so there are very real implications for human health and you'll notice something about tarawa it is very low lying it's that little green sliver on the horizon which makes them very nervous about rising oceans today i'd like to share with you some of my ocean adventures and tell you a little bit about what they've taught me and how i think we can maybe take some of those lessons and apply them to this environmental challenge that we face right now this is big trouble for these guys they've got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level and also as an increase in extreme weather events do to climate change they're expecting more waves to come in which will contaminate their fresh water supply i had a meeting with the president there who told me about his exit strategy for his country he expects that within the next fifty years the hundred thousand people that live there will have to relocate to new zealand or australia  and that made me think about how would i feel if britain was going to disappear under the waves if the places where i'd been born and gone to school very shortly i'll be setting out to try and get to australia and if i'm successful i'll be the first woman ever to row solo all the way across the pacific and i try and use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues to bring a human face to the ocean if the atlantic was about my inner journey discovering my own capabilities maybe the pacific has been about my outer journey and to take some of those things that i've learned out there and apply them to the situation that human kind now finds itself in i think there are probably three key points here the first one is about the stories we tell ourselves for so long i told myself that i couldn't have an adventure because i wasn't six foot tall and athletic and  and then that story changed i found out that people had rowed across oceans i even met one of them and she was just about my size so even though i didn't grow any taller i didn't sprout a beard something had changed my interior dialogue had changed the story that we collectively tell ourselves is that we need all this stuff that we need oil but about if we just change that story we do have alternatives and we have the power of free will to choose those alternatives those sustainable ones to create a greener future now some of you might be thinking hold on a minute she doesn't look very much like an ocean rower isn't she meant to be about this tall and the second point is about the accumulation of tiny actions we might think that anything that we do as an individual is just a drop in the ocean that it can't really make a difference but it does generally we haven't got ourselves into this mess through big disasters yes there have been the exxon valdezs and the chernobyls but mostly it's been an accumulation of bad decisions by billions of individuals day after day and year after year  by the same token we can turn that tide we can start making better wiser more sustainable decisions and when we do that we're not just one person anything that we do spreads ripples  other people will see if you're in the supermarket line and you pull out your reusable grocery bag maybe if we all start doing this we can make it socially unacceptable to say yes to plastic in the check out line that's just one example this is a world wide community i thought if i had the right house the right car or the right man in my life then i could be happy  but when i wrote that obituary exercise i actually grew up a little bit in that moment and realized that i needed to create my own future i couldn't just wait passively for happiness to come and find me  about this wide and maybe look a bit more like these guys you'll notice they've all got something that i don and it's very difficult to be happy on a planet that's wracked with famine and drought it's very difficult to be healthy on a planet where we've poisoned the and the sea and the air so shortly i'm going to be launching a new initiative called  and the idea here is that all our eco heroes will log at least one green deed every day it's meant to be a bit of a game  it we just want to try and create that awareness because sure changing a light bulb isn't going to change the world ,"hi my name is Ron Savage and I rode across oceans full years ago I rode solo across the Atlantic and since then I've done two out of three stages across the Pacific from San Francisco to Hawaii from Hawaii to Carrabelle and tomorrow I'll be leaving this boat to fly back to care of us to continue with a third and final stage of my rope across the Pacific cumulatively I would have rode over 8,000 Mi taking over three million old strokes and spent more than three hundred and twelve days alone on the ocean on a 23 ft rowboat. this is giving me a very special relationship with the ocean we have a bit of a love-hate thing going on about it like I did about a very strict about the teacher that I once had at school I think we'd like her but I did respect her and she took me a heck of a lot so you today I'd like to share with you some of my Ocean Adventures and tell you a little bit about what they've told me and how I think we can maybe take some of those license and apply them to this environmental challenge that we face right now. now some of you might be thinking hold on a minute she doesn't look very much like an ocean River isn't she meant to be about this talk about this while he's and maybe look a bit more like these guys the latest they will got something that I don't. well I said what you were thinking. I told you about the beds and no matter how long I spend on the ocean I haven't yet managed to muster a decent bid and I hope that it remains that way for a long time I didn't believe that I could have a big adventure the story that I told myself was that adventurous look like this I didn't look the part so I thought they were them and us and I was not one of them. play for 11 years I confirmed I did not pay for my kind of background was supposed to do I was working in an office in London as a Management Consultant and I think I knew from day one that the right job for me but that kind of conditioning just kept me to ask to see many years until I reach home it says he's and I thought you know I'm not getting any younger and I know what it is but I'm pretty certain that management consultancy business it so fast forward a few years I've gone through some changes to try not to that question of what am I supposed to be doing with my life I sat down one day and wrote two versions of my own a b tree. the one that I wanted a life of adventure on the one that I was actually heading. Was a nice normal Pleasant life but it wasn't where I wanted to be by the end of my life I wanted to live a life that I could be proud of and I remember looking at these two versions of a b tree and thinking I want to see the wrong track here if I carry on living as I am now I'm just end up where I want to be in 5 years or 10 years or at the end of my life. I made a few changes that come with some of these trappings with my old life and to a bit of a leap of logic decided to drive across the Atlantic Ocean County gets about 3000 Mi and it turned out to be the hardest thing I had ever done sure I wanted to get outside of my comfort zone but what I could have spinal stenosis getting out of your comfort zone is by definition extremely uncomfortable with the year was Hurricane Katrina that we're more tropical storms in the North Atlantic than ever before since records began and pretty early on that you stole started making their presence known. all four of my old Sprite before I reach halfway across but what can you do if you're in the middle of the ocean mean to propulsion so I just have to look around the boat and figure out what I was going to use to fix up these old say that I could carry on so I found a boat took on my trusty duct tape and splinted the boat-hook to the to the oils to reinforce it then when that guy you found out so I sold the wheel axles off my spare driving seat and use those I never knows Dave out I kind of Alliance One of the broken tools fixing stuff when I was letting my old life but it's amazing how resourceful you can become when you're in the middle of the ocean and there's only one way to get to the other side and he was kind of became a symbol of. just in how many ways I went beyond what I felt when my limit I suffered from 10th and Isis on my shoulders and soul to soul is on my Boston really struggled psychologically overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge realizing that if I carried on moving it to miles an hour 3000 Miles was going to take me a very very long time there was so many times when I thought I'd hit that limit but has no choice but to just carry on and trying to figure out how I was going to get to the other side without driving myself crazy. and eventually after a hundred and three days at Sea I arrived in Antigua I don't think I have ever felt so happy in my entire life and I didn't have to sell the tree confinement and winning an Oscar overalls into what I was used for it and to see all the people coming out to greet me and standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering and it was absolutely wonderful and I really love the pic of the challenge the bigger the sense of achievement when you get to the end of it. so this might be a good mood to take quick timeout sound surf USA cues about ocean rowing that might be going through your mind number one that I got asked what do you eat a few freeze dried meals but least I try and eat too much much more on princess tooth so i g i m beansprouts I ate fruit and nut Falls lot of nuts and about 30 pounds lighter the other end question number two how do you sleep with my eyes shut hahaha on my route so that I'm drifting with the winds and the currents while I'm sleeping on a good night I think my best asset was 11 miles in the right direction 13 miles in the wrong direction that's about that the office. what's my we're mostly a baseball cap running gloves and a smile or a frown depending on this site and lots of sun lotion do I have to chase boots I am totally self-sufficient sing out there I don't see anybody said that the whole time that I'm at Sea generally I'm finally on my crazy well I need something up to you to judge. how do you talk running across the Atlantic well actually you decide to row across the Pacific well I thought it was big but the Pacific is really really big. I think we tend to do to little bit of a disservice in our usual Maps I don't know for sure that the Brits love you as well and we can haul off and fling it to the Far Corners of the world where is he in Google Earth this is how the Pacific looks it pretty much covers off the planet if you little bit of North America and a sliver of Australia down there. it is rebake 65 million square miles and surviving a straight line across it would be about eight thousand miles unfortunately Ocean Road by the time I get to Australia if I get to Australia I would have rode probably nine or ten thousand miles an hour. because nobody in their right mind would throw straight passed away without dropping in I decided to cut is very big undertaking into three segments. the first attempt didn't go so well in 2007 I did a lot of involuntary capsize drill three times in 24 hours but like being in washing machine but it got a bit dinged up at least somebody with a bit of a hero complex decided that they needed Saving Face on you about this is on the Coast Guard Plane turned up overhead I try to tell him to go away we had a bit of a battle of wills I lost in thought I listed. opal radio for it was one of the worst feelings of my life is always looked it up on that winch line into the helicopter ever see her again very expensive operation and then wait another nine months before I could get back home since the ocean again but what do you do full time in a long time to get up 10 to the following you and fortunately this time I made it safely across to Hawaii but it was not without misadventure my will to make a broke only the most simple to keep the kids that I have on the boat, solar panels it sucks in saltwater intensity into freshwater but it doesn't react very well to being a list in Ocean which is what happened to it. fortunately help was at hand there was another unusual Banks out that at the same time thing is I was doing bringing awareness to the North Pacific Garbage Patch that area in the North Pacific about twice the size of Texas with an estimated 3.5 million tons of trash in it circulating at the Centre of that no specific child out of plastic trash 15,000 empty water bottles last together is two pontoons they were getting very slowly call Selina Island Long Beach because we're coming undone I thought he was approaching the end of my world series is luckily all courses for converging they were running out of food I was running out of water so we leave a spy satellite phone and arranged to meet up. and it took about a week for us to actually gradually converge I was doing a pathetically slow speed of about 1.3 North and everything then Emoji nails in a meeting. But eventually we did manage to meet up and talk to at least three months the one that he could not say was faster than this one they close few weeks earlier when they open this one up they found its stomach was full of plastic and this is really bad news because pasta is not in any substance it leaches out chemicals into the flesh is a pool Chrissy that I sit and then we come along and eat. Full chrisa and we got some of the talks and accumulating in all but he's as well so they're all very real patients the human health. I bet you she made it to Hawaii still alive and the following is set out on the second stage of the Pacific from Hawaii to Tarawa and you'll notice something about Tara is his very low lying it's a little green sliver on the horizon which makes them very nervous about rising oceans this is big trouble for these guys in about 6 feet above sea level and also assist increase in extreme weather events due to climate change they're expecting more ways to come in over the fringing reef which will contaminate that fresh water supply I had a meeting with the president that you told me about his exit strategy for his country he expects it within the next 50 years 100,000 people at least I will have to relocate to New Zealand or Australia. and that made me think about how would I feel if Britain was going to disappear under the ways it's a place is where I being born and going to school and got married it's all these places were just going to disappear forever how literally ungrounded that would make me feel. very shortly I'll be setting out to try and get to Australia and if I'm successful I'll be the first woman ever to roll solo all the way across the Pacific and I trying to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues to bring a human face to the ocean if you at lunch it was about my energy any discovering my own capabilities maybe the Pacific as being about my Alta Jenny figuring out how I can use my interesting career choice to be of service to the world and self in I think they were probably three key points here. the first one is about the stories that we tell ourselves. so you don't know I told myself that I couldn't have an adventure because I wasn't 6-foot tools and a plastic in business and then that story changed I found out that people had rowed across oceans I even met one of them and she was just about my size so even though I didn't grab any tools I didn't spouse to bid something could change my mind. I changed at the moment the story that we collect me tell ourselves is that we need all this stuff that we need oil but what about if we just change that story we do have and we have the power of free will to choose those Olson is so sustainable ones to create a Greener future. the second point is about the accumulation of tiny actions. we might think that anything that we do is an individual is just a drop in the ocean that it can't really make a difference but it does generally we haven't got ourselves into this mess through big disasters yes stopping it from Valdez has and the Chernobyl but mostly it's been an accumulation of fat Decisions by billions of individuals they have to say about the same token we can tend not tied we can start making better while he's almost as painful decisions I love you too that would not just one person anything that we do spreads with the other people will see if you're in the supermarket line and you pull out you'll reusable grocery bag maybe if we all start seeing if we can make it socially unacceptable to say yes to plastic in the checkout line. that's just one example this is a worldwide community. the other point it's about taking responsibility to see much of my life I want to do something else to make me happy I thought if I had the right house so the right car or the right man in my life then I could be happy but when I write. A b tree exercise I actually grew up a little bit in that moment and realized that I needed to create my own couch and I couldn't just wait possibly for happiness to come and find me. I plan on being around for a long time I when I'm 90 years old I want to be happy and healthy and it's very difficult to be happy on the planet that's wrapped with famine and drought it's very difficult to be healthy on a planet where we poisoned the on the C and D Ave. play shortly I'm going to be launching a new initiative called Eco Heroes and the idea here is that every day it's a bit of a game we can't make an iPhone off House of it we just want to try and create that awareness because she'll changing a lightbulb isn't going to change the world but that attitude that awareness that needs to change the lightbulb in a reusable coffee mug mug that is what could change the wells I really believe that we stand a very important point in history we have a choice we've been blessed or cursed with free will we can choose a green a future and we can get the if we all pull together take it one stroke the time",0.7604166269302368
MarvinMinsky_2003,the single best way is to get them to understand that what they're being told is a whole lot of nonsense and then of course you have to do something about how to moderate that so that anybody can  of listen to you pollution energy shortage environmental diversity poverty how do we make stable societies longevity okay there 're lots of problems to worry about anyway the question i think people should talk about and it's absolutely taboo is how many people should there be and i think it should be about one hundred million or maybe five hundred million and then notice that a great many of these problems disappear if you had one hundred million people properly spread out if you ask people about what part of psychology do they think is hard and you say well what about thinking and emotions most people will say then if there's some garbage you throw it away preferably where you can't see it and it will rot or you throw it into the ocean and some fish will benefit from it the problem is how many people should there be and it's a sort of choice we have to make most people are about sixty inches high or more and there's this cube loss so if you make them this big by using nanotechnology i suppose then you could have thousand times as many that would solve the problem but i don't see anybody doing any research on making people smaller now it's nice to reduce the population but a lot of people want to have children  lucky you've got twenty three from each parent you give them a scanner or whatever you need and they look at their chromosomes and each of them says which one he likes best or she that be enough and then the children would get plenty of support and nurturing and mentoring and the world population would decline very rapidly and everybody would be totally happy is a little further off in the future and there's this great novel that arthur clarke wrote twice called against the fall of night are terribly hard they're incredibly complex they can't i have no idea of how they work but thinking is really very straightforward it's just sort of some kind of logical reasoning or something and the city and the stars they're both wonderful and largely the same except that computers happened in between and arthur was looking at this old book and he said well that was wrong the future must have some computers so in the second version of it there are one hundred billion or one thousand billion people on earth but they're all stored on hard disks or floppies or whatever they have in the future and you let a few million of them out at a time a person comes out they live for a thousand years doing whatever they do and then when it's time to go back for a billion years or a million i forget the numbers don't matter but there really aren't very many people on earth at a time and you get to think about yourself and your memories and before you go back into suspension you edit your memories and you change your personality and so forth the plot of the book is that he says maybe this isn't the best way and wrecks the whole system i don't think the solutions that i proposed are good enough or smart enough i think the big problem is that we're not smart enough to understand which of the problems we're facing are good enough therefore we have to build super intelligent machines like hal as you remember at some point in the book for two thousand and one hal realizes that the universe is too big and grand and profound for those really stupid astronauts if you contrast hal 's behavior with the triviality of the people on the spaceship  can see what's written between the lines well what are we going to do about that we could get smarter i think that we're pretty smart as compared to chimpanzees  but we're not smart enough to deal with the colossal problems that we face either in abstract mathematics or in figuring out economies or balancing the world around  but that's not the hard part so here 's a list of problems that come up one nice problem is what do we do about health so one thing we can do is live longer and nobody knows how hard that is but we'll probably find out in a few years you see there's two forks in the road we know that people live twice as long as chimpanzees almost and nobody lives more than one hundred and twenty years for reasons that aren't very well understood but lots of people now live to ninety or one hundred unless they shake hands too much or something like that and so maybe if we lived two hundred years we could accumulate enough skills and knowledge to solve some problems so that's one way of going about it and as i said we don't know how hard that is it might be after all most other mammals live half as long as the chimpanzee so we're sort of three and a half or four times have four times the longevity of most mammals and in the case of the primates we have almost the same genes we only differ from chimpanzees in the present state of knowledge which is absolute hogwash the other day i was reading something and the person said probably the largest single cause of disease is handshaking in the west  maybe by just a few hundred genes what i think is that the gene counters don't know what they're doing yet and whatever you do don't read anything about genetics that's published within your lifetime the stuff has a very short half life same with brain science and so it might be that if we just fix four or five genes we can live two hundred years or it might be that it's just thirty or forty and i doubt that it's several hundred so this is something that people will be discussing and lots of ethicists you know an ethicist is somebody who sees something wrong with whatever you have in mind very hard to find an ethicist who considers any change worth making because he says what about the consequences and of course we're not responsible for the consequences of what we're doing now are we  like all this complaint about clones and yet two random people will mate and have this child and both of them have some  pretty rotten genes and the child is likely to come out to be average which by chimpanzee standards is very good indeed if we do have longevity then we'll have to face the population growth problem anyway because if people live two hundred or one thousand years then we can't let them have a child more than about once every two hundred or one thousand years and so there won 't be any workforce and one of the things laurie garrett pointed out and others have is that a society that doesn't have people of working age is in real trouble and things are going to get worse because there's nobody to educate the children or to and there was a little study about people who don't handshake and comparing them with ones who do handshake and i haven't the foggiest idea of where you find the ones that don't handshake because they must be hiding feed the old and when i'm talking about a long lifetime of course i don't want somebody who 's two hundred years old to be like our image of what a two hundred year old is which is dead actually you know there's about four hundred different parts of the brain which seem to have different functions knows how most of them work in detail but we do know that there 're lots of different things in there and they don't always work together i like freud 's theory that most of them are cancelling each other out and so if you think of yourself as a sort of a city with a hundred resources then when you're afraid for example you may discard your long range goals but you may think deeply and focus on exactly how to achieve that particular goal you throw everything else away you become a monomaniac all you care about is not stepping out on that platform and when you're hungry food becomes more attractive and so forth so i see emotions as highly evolved sub sets of your capability emotion is not something added to thought an emotional state is what you get when you remove i hope in the next few years to show that this will lead to smart machines and i guess i better skip all the rest of this which are some details on how we might make those smart machines and the main idea is in fact that the core of a really smart machine is one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you this is a problem of such and such a type and therefore there's a certain way or ways of thinking that are good for that problem so i think the future main problem of psychology is to classify types of predicaments types of situations types of obstacles and also to classify available and possible ways to think and pair them up so you see it's almost like a pavlovian  and the people who avoid that have thirty percent less infectious disease or something we lost the first hundred years of psychology by really trivial theories where you say how do people learn how to react to a situation what i'm saying is after we go through a lot of levels including designing a huge  messy system with thousands of parts we'll end up again with the central problem of psychology saying not what are the situations but what are the kinds of problems and what are the kinds of strategies how do you learn them how do you connect them up how does a really creative person invent a new way of thinking out of the available resources and so forth so i think in the next twenty years if we can get rid of all of the traditional it was thirty one and a quarter percent so if you really want to solve the problem of epidemics and so forth let 's start with that and since i got that idea i've had to shake hundreds of hands and i think the only way to avoid it is to have some horrible visible disease and then you don't have to explain education how do we improve education ,if you ask people about what what part of psychology do they think is hard and you said well what about thinking and emotions most people will take emotions are terribly hard they're incredibly complex there I have no idea of how they worked but thinking is really very straightforward it's just sort of some kind of logical reasoning or something but that's not the hard part so here's a list of problems that come up when nice problem is what do we do about health the other day I was reading something and the person said probably the largest single cause of disease is hand shaking in the West. and there was a little study about people who don't handshake and comparing them with ones who do handshake and I haven't the foggiest idea of where you find the ones that don't have Shake because they must be hiding and that's and the people who avoid that have 30% less infectious disease or something or maybe was 31 in a quarter percent so if you really want to solve the problem of epidemics and so forth let's start with that and since I got that ideas I've had to. Sheik's hundreds of hands and and. I think the only way to avoid it if that's a horrible visible disease and then you don't have to explain education how do we improve education. what's the single best way is to get them to understand that what they're being told is a whole lot of nonsense and then of course you have to do something about how to moderate that so that anybody can subdue listen to you pollution energy shortage environmental diversity poverty how do we make stable societies longevity okay there lots of problems to worry about anyway the question I think people should talk about and it's absolutely taboo is how many people should there be. and I think it should be about a hundred million or maybe five hundred million and then noticed that all of these that a great many of these problems disappear if you had 100 million people properly spread out. then. if there's some garbage you throw it away. preferably where you can't see it and it will rot or you throw it into the ocean and some fish will benefit from it the problem is how many people should there be and it's a choice we have to make most people are about 60 in high or more and there's this Cube law so he made them this big by using nanotechnology I suppose then you can have a thousand times as many that would solve the problem but I don't see anybody doing any research on making people smaller now it's nice to reduce the population but a lot of people want to have children. and is one solution that's probably only a few years off and you know you have 46 chromosomes and if you're lucky you got 23 from each parent can have you get an extra one or dropped one out but so you can skip the grandparents and great-grandparents stage and go right to the great great grandparents and you have 46 people and you give them a scanner or whatever you need and they look at their chromosomes and each of them says which one he likes best Hershey no reason to have just two Sexes anymore so each child has 46 parents and I suppose you could let each group of 46 parents have 15 children. not be enough and then the children we get plenty of support and nurturing and mentoring in the world population would decline very rapidly and everybody would be totally happy time sharing is a little further off in the future and there's this great novel that Arthur Clarke wrote twice Cold against the full of Night and the city and the Stars they're both wonderful and largely the same except the computers happened in between and Arthur was looking this old book and he said well that was wrong the future must have some computers so in the second version of it there are a hundred billion or a thousand billion people on earth. but they're all stored in on hard disks or floppies or whatever they have in the future and you let a few million of them out of time person comes out they live for a thousand years doing whatever they do and then when it's time to go back for a billion years or billion I forget numbers don't matter but there really aren't very many people on Earth at a time and you get to think about yourself and your memories and before you go back into suspension you edit your memories and you change your personality and so forth the plot of the book is that. there's not enough diversity so that the people who designed the city make sure that every now and then an entirely new person is created and in the novel a particular one named Alvin is created in. he says maybe this isn't the best way and wrecks the whole system but. I don't think the solutions that I proposed are good enough or smart enough I think the big problem is that we're not smart enough to understand which of the problems we're facing are good enough there for we have to build superintelligent machines like how nice you remember at some point in the book for 2001 he'll realize is that the universe is too big and Grand in profound for those really stupid astronauts if you contrast house Behavior with the triviality of of the people on the spaceship you can see what's written between the lines well what are we going to do about that we can get smarter. I think that we're pretty smart has compared to chimpanzees but we're not smart enough to deal with the Colossal problems that we Face either in abstract mathematics or in figuring out the economy's or balancing the world around so one thing we can do is live longer and nobody knows how hard that is but we'll probably find out in a few years so there's two forks in the road we know that people live twice as long as chimpanzees almost. and nobody lives more than a hundred and twenty years for reasons that aren't very well understood but lots of people now live to ninety or a hundred unless they shake hands to buy for something like that and so maybe if we live two hundred years we could accumulate enough skills and knowledge to to solve some problems so that's that's one way of going about it and as I said we don't know how hard that is it might be after all most other mammals live half as long as the chimpanzees so we're sort of 3 1/2 / 4 * 4 * 11 jevity of most mammals and in the case of the primates we have almost the same genes we only differ from chimpanzees in the present state of knowledge which is absolute hogwash Maybe by just a few hundred jeans what I think is that the gene counters don't know what they're doing yet in whatever. you don't read anything about genetics that's published with your lifetime or something. The staff has a very short half-life same with brain size panda. so it might be that if we just fix 45 jeans we can live 200 years or it might be that is just 30 or 40 and I doubt that it's several hundred so this is something that people will be discussing and lots of a physicist you know somebody who sees something wrong with whatever you have in mind and it's very hard to find an ethicist who considers any change worth making because this is what about the consequences and of course we're not responsible for the consequences of what we're doing now are we like all this complaint about clones and yet two random people will mate and have this child and both of them have some pretty rotten jeans most child is likely to come out to be average which by chimpanzee standards is very good indeed but. if we do have longevity then we'll have to face the population growth problem anyway cuz people live in two hundred or a thousand years then we can't let them have a child more than about once every two hundred or thousand years and so there won't be any work for us and want to think Lori Garrett pointed out and others have is that a society that has only the doesn't have people of working age is in real trouble and things are going to get worse because there's nobody to educate the children over to feed the old when I talk about a long lifetime of course I don't want. I don't want somebody who's 200 years old to be like our image of what is a 200 year old is his dad actually you know there's about four hundred different parts of the brain which seem to have different functions nobody knows how most of them work in detail but we do know that there are lots of different things in there and they don't always work together I like Freud's theory that most of them are canceling each other out and so if you think of yourself as as a sort of a city with a hundred resources then when you're afraid. for example you make discard your long-range goal but you may think deeply and focus on exactly how to achieve that particular go you throw everything else away you become a monomaniac all you care about is not stepping out on that platform and when you're hungry food becomes more attractive and so forth so I see emotions as a highly evolved subsets of your capability the motion is not something added to thought than emotional state is what you get when you remove a hundred or two hundred of your normally available resources South Peggy of emotions as the opposite of as something less than thinking is immensely productive and I hope in the next few years to show that this will lead to Smart machines and I guess I better skip all the rest of this which are some details on how we might make those smart machines. and. and the main idea is in fact that the core of a really smart machine is is one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you this is the problem of such and such a type and therefore there's a certain way or ways of thinking that are good for that cut problem so I think the future main problem of psychology is to classify types of predicament types of situations types of obstacles and also Declassified available and possible ways to think and pair them up so you see it's almost like a pavlovian we lost the first hundred years of Psychology by really trivial theories where you say how did people learn how to react to a situation what I'm saying is. after we go through a lot of levels including designing a huge like huge message system with thousands of parts will end up again with the central problem psychology take what are the what are these situations but what are the kinds of problems and what are the kinds of strategies how do you learn them how do you connect them up how does a really creative person invent a new way of thinking out of the available resources and and so forth so I think in the next 20 years if we can get rid of all of the traditional approaches to artificial intelligence like neural Nets in genetic algorithms and real BAE Systems and just turn our sights a little bit higher to say can we make a system that can use all those things for the right kind of problem some problems are good for neural Nets we know that others neural Nets are hopeless on them genetic algorithms are great for certain things I suspect I know what they're bad at and I won't tell you. thank you,0.8307291269302368

TimBernersLee_2010U,which houses are there which houses have been connected to the water and he got from other data sources information to show which was not impressed either the judge was not impressed to the tune of ten point nine million dollars that's the power of taking one piece of data another piece of data putting it together and showing the result let 's look at some data from the u k now this is u k government data a completely independent site where does my money go it allows anybody to go there and burrow down you can burrow down by a particular type of spending or you can go through all the different regions and compare them so that's happening in the u k with u k government data yes certainly you can do it over here too here 's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending in fact this is the graph of the number of data sets in the repositories of data gov and data gov uk and i'm delighted to see a great competition between the u k in blue and the u s here at ted i asked you to give me your data to put your data on the web on the basis that if people put data onto the web in red how can you use this stuff well for example if you have lots of data about places you can take from a postcode which is like a zip code plus four for a specific group of houses you can make paper the data which was released about the afghan elections it allows you to set your own criteria for what sort of things you want to look at the red circles are polling stations on this visualization put together by ito world shows an edit in two thousand and nine made to the open street map the world during the same year every flash is an edit somebody somewhere looking at the open street map and realizing it could be better you can see europe  some places perhaps not as much as they should be here focusing in on haiti the map of port au prince at the end of two thousand and nine was not all it could be not as good as the map of california fortunately just after the earthquake geoeye a commercial company released satellite imagery with a license which allowed the open source community to use it this is january in time lapse of people editing that's the earthquake after the earthquake immediately people all over the world mappers who wanted to help and could looked at that imagery edited the map quickly building it up we're focusing now on port au prince the light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the so now we have immediately a real time map showing where there are the map showing on the left hand side that hospital actually that's a hospital ship this is a real time map that shows blocked roads damaged buildings and refugee camps it shows things that are needed so  have imagined so today i'm back just to show you a few things to show you in fact that there is an open data two days it took the times online to make a map a mashed up map we call these things mash ups a mashed up user interface that allows you to go in there and have a look and find out whether your bicycle route to work was affected here 's more data traffic survey data again put out by the u k government this data effect things well actually let 's get back to two thousand and eight look at zanesville ohio here is a map a lawyer made he put on it the water ,last year he said I asked you to give me at 8 to put the beta on the web on the basis that if people put data onto the web that they do scientific data communicate whatever it is it will be used by other people to do wonderful things in ways that they never have imagined so today I'm back just to show you a few things to show you was in fact there is an open data. movement afoot now around the world The Cry of Royal dates now which I made people make in the auditorium was heard around the world so it's traffic Story the first one we saw lots of people picked up with when in March smartpants infection off to Ted in the UK about bicycle accident. two days it took the Times online to make a map imaginable not because they think mashup mashup user interfaces as he should go in there and have a look and find out whether you'll bicycle route was affected his moderate the traffic to this day perfect thing for Access kid back to 2008 Zanesville Ohio water and he got some other day two sources of information which. houses occupied by white people well it was too much of a correlation that you felt between which houses are prized by white people how much has had water in the judge was not impressed by the tune of 10.9 million dollars that's the power of taking one piece of data now that we should date of putting it together and showing the result that's completely independent of site where does Mike money allows said you would go there and borrow down you can borrow down by a particular type of spending or you can go through all the different regions and compare them so that's happening in the UK would you pick up Monday to yes it certainly you can do it over here is a site which allows you to look at the recovery spending in California taking off her treats off of Long Beach California you can go have a look at what recovery money they've been spending on different things such as energy in fact of datasets in the repository that they don't come up and date. and I'd like to see a great competition between the UK and blue in the US and talking to use this stuff if you have lots of data about places you can take it from a store which is like a zip plus 4 for specific group of houses you can make paper print off a paper which is very very specific things about the bus stop the things are you a mash-up of the date which was released about the Afghan elections it allows you to take the Run criteria for what for the things you want to look at the red circles are polling stations selected by your criteria can you connect also other things on the map to see what other fact is like the Threat Level so that was Thursday to I actually put on the map cuz it wasn't the map report said last year I was not the only person each flash on this visualization put the World shows. edit in 2009 made to the openstreetmap that's not a spin the world during the same year every flashes and somebody somewhere looking at the openstreetmap and realizing it could be better you're going to see if you're a piece of Blaze with updates from places that's not as much as they should be here focusing in on Haiti the map of the end of 2009 was not all it could be not as good as a map of California. To the earthquake GOI complete released satellite imagery this is January time lapse people editing fake people all over the world Masters who wanted to help and cook built quickly building up with focusing now put to press the blue is refugee camps Devon has a spotted from the air so now we have immediately in real-time map showing where there are refugee camps. best map to use if you'll do relief work in Port-au-Prince witness the fact is here on the Storm engine is being used by rest of your team that the hospital at the hospital ship this is a real-time map that shows blocked Road damaged buildings refugee camps and things and they needed so if you've been involved in that at all I just wanted to say if whether it whatever you've been doing whether you just in chatting rotate and now he's being put in governmental scientific data online I just want to tell you something did you say thank you very much and we have only just started.

LorettaNapoleoni_2009G,the time of the phone call i just had a baby i successfully completed a management buyout to the company i was working with and the last thing i wanted to do was to go back home and touring the high security is exactly what i did because i wanted to know what had turned my best friend into a terrorist and why she'd never tried to recruit me so this is exactly what i did now i the answer very quickly i actually had failed the psychological profiling of a terrorist the center committee of the red brigades had judged me too single minded and too opinionated to become a good terrorist my friend on the other hand she was a good terrorist because she was very good at following orders she also embraced violence because she believed that the only way to unblock what at the time was show you how terrorism actually interacts with our daily life fifteen years ago i received a phone call from a friend known as a blocked democracy italy a country run by the same party for thirty five years was i was interviewing the red brigades i also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics or ideology but actually was ruled by economics they were constantly short of they were constantly searching for cash now contrary to what many people believe terrorism is actually a very expensive business i'll give you an idea in the nineteen seventies the turnover of the red brigades on a yearly basis was seven million dollars  this is roughly between one hundred and one hundred and fifty million today now you know if you live underground it's really hard to produce this amount of money this also explains why when i was interviewing the red brigades and then later on other arms organizations including members of al zarqawi group in the middle east  the political vision of a terrorist organization is decided by the leadership which generally is never more than five to seven people all the others do day in and day out is search for money  at the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners in italian jails he asked me if i wanted to interview the red brigades  for example i was interviewing this part timer from the red brigades it was he loved sailing he was a really keen sailor and he had this beautiful boat and he told me that the best time of his life was when he was a member of the red brigades sailing every summer back and forth from lebanon where he would pick up soviet weapons from the plo and then carry them all the way to sardinia where the other arms organization from europe would go and take their share of the arms for that service the red brigades were actually paid a fee which went to fund their organization so because i am a trained economist and i think in economic terms all of the sudden i maybe there is something here maybe there is a link a commercial link between one organization and another one but it was only when  i interviewed mario moretti the head of the red brigades the man who kidnapped and killed aldo moro  italian former prime minister that i finally realized that terrorism is actually business  was back in the city of london having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist this guy thought in the same way i did now as many of you may remember the red brigades was a terrorist marxist organization which was very active in italy from the nineteen sixties until the mid nineteen eighties so i decided that i wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism naturally nobody wanted to fund my research in fact i think many people thought that i was a bit crazy you know that woman that goes around to foundations asking for money thinking about the economics of terrorism which has been created by arms organizations since the end of world war ii and what is even more shocking is that this system  the evolution of our own system of our western capitalism and there are three main stages the first one is the state sponsor of of course is the globalization of terrorism so  fully funding arms organizations a mix of legal and illegal activities is used so the link between crime and terror is established very early on for example the iran contra affair then comes the late nineteen seventies early eighties and  groups successfully carry out the privatization of terrorism so they the sponsor and start funding themselves now again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities so as part of their strategy the red brigades never spoke with anybody not even with their lawyers they sat in silence through their trails waving occasionally at family and friends and the ira which control the private transportation system in northern ireland did exactly the same thing so every single time that somebody got into a taxi in belfast without knowing actually was funding the ira but the great change came of course with globalization and deregulation this is when to link up also financially with each other but above all they started to do serious business with the world of crime and together they money laundered their dirty business through the same channel this is when we see the birth of the transnational arms this is an organization that can raise money across border but also that is able to carry out attacks in more than one country comes back at times of great transformation globalization being one of those transformations it is at this times in which now i calculated how big was this international economic system composed by crime terror and illegal economy before nine eleven and it is a staggering one point five trillion dollars it is trillions it's not billions this is about twice the gdp of the united kingdom soon will be more considering where this country is going  now all this money flew into the u s economy because the bulk of the money was denominated in u s dollars and the money laundering was taking place inside the united states the entry point of course of most of this money  facilities so this was a vital injection of cash into the u s economy now when i went to look at the figures of the u s money supply the u s money supply is the amount of dollars that  the federal reserves prints every year in order to satisfy the increase in the demand for dollars which of course reflects the growth of the economy  these were money taken out in suitcases or in containers in cash of course these were money taken out by criminals and money launderers these were money taken out to fund the growth of the terror illegal and criminal economy so you see what is the relationship the united states actually a country that is the reserve currency of the world what does it mean that means that it has a privilege that other countries do not can borrow against the total amount of dollars in circulation in the world this privilege is called seigniorage no  country can do that all the other countries for example the united kingdom can borrow only  inside its own borders so here is the implication of the relationship between the worlds of crime terror and illegal economy and our economy the  when i asked my friend why the red brigades want to talk to me he said that the female members of in the nineteen nineties was borrowing against the growth of the terror illegal and criminal economy this is how close we are with this world now this situation changed of course after nine eleven because george bush launched the war on terror part of the war on terror was the introduction of the patriot act  many of you know that the patriot act is a legislation that greatly reduces the liberties of americans in order to protect them against is a section of the patriot act which refers specifically to finance and it is in fact an anti money laundering legislation from doing any businesses with off shore facilities it closed that door between the money laundering in dollars and the u s economy  also gave the u s monetary authorities the right to monitor any dollar transaction taking place anywhere in the world now you can imagine what was the reaction of the international finance and banking all the bankers said to their clients get out of the dollars actually supported my name in particular one person had put it forward she was my childhood friend and go and invest somewhere else now the euro was a newly born currency of great opportunity for business and of course for investment and this is what people and terror people simply moved their money laundering  activities away from the united states into europe why did this happen this happened because  was a unilateral legislation it was introduced only in the united states and it was introduced only for the u s dollars in europe a similar legislation was not so within six months europe became the epicenter of the money laundering activities of the world  so this is how incredible are the relationship between the world of crime and the world of terror and our own life so why did i tell you this story i told you this story because you must understand that there is a world that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers this is the only way for you to step into the dark side and have a look at it and believe me it's going to be scary it's going to be frightful but it's going to enlighten you and above all it's not going to be boring ,"I'm not sure you out terrorism actually interact with our daily life of 15 years ago I received a phone call from a friend at the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoner in Italian jails in the red brigades. many of you may remember the red brigades were a terrorist a Marxist organization which was very active in Italy for the 1960s until the mid-1980s sponsor their snot is never spoke with anybody know even with the lawyer they sat in silence through the trials that wedding occasionally a family and friends. United 93 they declare the end of the Armed struggle and they drew list of people with whom they would talk and tell their story and I was one of those people. when I asked my friend well why the hebra gates want to talk to me he said that the female members of the organization and actually supported my name in particular one person at Put It Forward. She was my childhood friend. should I join the red brigades and became a leader of the organization not really I didn't know that until today she was arrested in fact I read in the newspaper. and the time on the phone called I just asked a baby I successfully completed the management buyout of the company was working with and that the last thing I wanted to do was to go back home and touring the Ice Cube recent but this is exactly what I did because I want you to know what at turn my best friend into a terrorist and why should never try to recruit me. so this is exactly what I did.. No iPhone the answer quickly too single-minded and too opinionated to become a good terrorists them my friend she was because she was very good at following orders she also Embrace violence because she believed that the only way to unblock what the time was known as a block of democracy Italy a country run by the same party for 35 years. at the same time what I was interviewing there every day so I also discovered that their life was not ruled by Paul it is or ideology but actually was ruled by economics it would cost them too short of cash they were constantly searching for cash expensive business so I'll give you an idea in the 1970s that turnover of the red brigades on a yearly basis was at 7 million dollars this is roughly between 100 and 150 Millions today on the ground is really hard to produce this amount of money. also explain why where was Interview with the red brigades and then later on I got arms organization including members of all the Care Group in the Middle East that everybody was extremely reluctant to talk about ideology or politics because they had no idea the political division by the leadership which channel is never more than there are five to seven people all the others to do day in and day out a search for money. once for sample I was interviewing this part-time and from the red Brigade it was a psychiatrist in love selling it was a really Keen sailor and they said the best time of his life was when he was a member of the red brigades and he was selling everything back and forth he would pick up Soviet weapons from the PLO and then carry them all the way to tsedenia where are the organization from you I would go and take their share of the arm for that service the red brigades were actually paid states which one to find the organization so because I am a trained Economist and I think maybe there's something here maybe there is a link a commercial link between one organization and another one. but it was only when I interviewed Maria Moretti the edge of the red brigades. a man who kidnapped and killed tomorrow Italian former prime minister that I finally realize that terrorism is actually a business lunch with him in the eye security prison in Easley answer as we would eat think I had the distinct feeling I was back in the city of London having lunch with the fellow Banker or an economy these guy. In the same way I did. so I have decided that I wanted to investigate the economics of terrorists must naturally be crazy you know that woman that goes around to Foundation asking for money thank you about the economics of terrorism so in the end I took a decision that thing Reggie spect they changed my life I sold my company and funded the research myself. and what are discover is this parallel reality another International economic system which runs parallel to our own which has been created by our organization since the end of World War Two and what is even more shocking these system as follow step-by-step the evolution of our own system a western capitalist and the three main stages the first one is the state sponsor of terrorism the second one is the privatization of terrorist and the third of course is the globalization on Saturday. so State sponsor of terrorism feature of the Cold War this is when the two superpowers were fighting a war by proxy along the periphery of the sphere of influence fully funding organization and mix of legal and illegal activities is used so the link between crime and terror is established very early on is the best example the contras in Nicaragua created by the CIA legally funded by the US Congress illegally found it by the Reagan Administration of operation for example data and Contra affair. Beckham's the late 1970s early 80s and some groups to successfully carry out the privatization of independence from the start funding them self. know a game we see a mix of legal and illegal activities are so out of that used to get the percentage of the smuggling of Ashish from the back of a leg which is the mileage between Lebanon and Syria and the IRA which control the private transportation system in Northern Ireland the same thing so every single time somebody got into a taxi in Belfast without knowing actually responding the IRS. but the great change came of course with globalization and their relation this is when we're able to link up also financially with each other but above all they start to do serious business with the word of crime and together they money launder the dirty business through the same channel this is when we see the birth of the transnational arms organization this is an organization that can raise money cross-border but also that is able to carry out attacks in more than one country. now did it relation also brought back roganomics. so what does roganomics which is constantly lurking in the background of History he comes back at times the great transformation globalization been one of those transformation it is at this time in which politics actually loses control of the economy and economy becomes a rogue Fort working against us he has happened before in history has happened with the full load of that Roman Empire happen with Industrial Revolution and he actually happen again with the fall of the Berlin Wall. now I calculated how big was this International economic system composed by crime Terror and illegal economy before 9/11. and it's a staggering 1.5 trillion dollars it is trillion is not billions of this is about twice the GDP of the United Kingdom soon will be more considering where this country is going. now I'm 2911 the bulk of all this money flew into the US economy because the bulk of the money was denominated in US Dollars and the money laundering was taking place inside the United States the entry point of course of most of this money where the offshore facilities of cash into the US economy. no one no one to look at the figures of the US money supply the US money supply is the amount of dollars that the federal reserve's Prince every year in order to satisfy the increase in the demand for dollars which of course reflects the growth of the economy to fix a growing number of this dollars with Ashley leaving the United States never to come back this where money taken out in suitcase or in containers in cash or money taken out by criminals and money launderer said these were money taken out to fund the growth of the terror illegal and criminal economy. so you see what is the relationship of the United States actually is the country that has the reserve currency of the word what does it mean that means that you had the privilege the other countries do not have he can borrow against the total amount of dollars in circulation in the world this privilege is called senior age only against the amount of money in circulation inside its own borders so here's the implication of the relationship between the words of a crime Terror and the legal economy and our economy the US in the 1990s was borrowing against the growth of the terror illegal and criminal economy. this is how close we are with this word. now this is where I should change clothes after 9:11 because George Bush launch the war on terror parts of the war on terror was the introduction of the Patriot Act I had to talk to the legislation that greatly reduces the Liberties of America in order to protect them against terrorists and it is in fact an auntie money laundering legislation what the Patriot Act did was to prohibit u.s. bank and you must register foreign Banks from doing any business with offshore facility he closed the door between your money laundering in dollars and the US economy. he also gave the US monetary Authority has the right to monitor any dollar transaction taking place anywhere in the world. now you can imagine what was the reaction of the international finance and banking all the blankets head to their client get out of the dollar and go anywhere somewhere else. The Euro was a newly-born currency of a great opportunity for businesses and of course for investment and this is what people did nobody wants the relationship to monitor their relationship with their clientele. the safety course in the world of crime and Terror people simply in a move that money laundering. activities away from the United States into Europe. why did this happen this happened because the Patriot Act with a unilateral legislation was introduced only in the United States and it was introduced only for the u.s. dollars in Europe is similar legislation was not introduced So within six months Europe became the a b Centre of the money laundering activities of the word. so this is all Incredibles are the relationship between the words of crime and the World of terror and our own life. so why does Hello this story I told you this story because you must understand that there is a word that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers including the personal relationship that you have with friends and family you got to question everything that is told you you including what I just told you today this is the only way for you to step into the dark side and have a look at it and believe me it's going to be scary is going to be frightful but is going to Enlighten you and above all is not going to be boring. traffic is a global epidemic traffic is creating 45% of the world's air pollution in the UK time wasted in traffic cost twenty billion a year would you pay for clean the brim of the Falls to commute Stockholm put it to a vote. how to do something install come to improve the environment and to get the better of a flow in the traffic will put a price on taking your car into the central post off, and we called that congestion charges. if you stop a system like this and it doesn't work on the first day then you will be in big trouble it must be perfect from Davon. there are teaching them tickets to the city each is equipped with cameras on the rear and front license plates these pictures are sent to Central system that identifies the license plates and make sure that the right person pays for the right passages to read the license plate we went out IBM's Global organization and the R&D centres and find a very good software we could use a way to manage p.m. to mount it in two months time going to 9% of old pictures are correct identified. nice guys this is how it should be all the time you can see the traffic of the truck is 6 p.m. before we have the congestion charge in the traffic was chewing up at this time of day it is I think it's a good idea because I think that we should take care of the environments in the CD was about fourteen percent better that is huge International interest from different parts of the world from the United States from Latin America from China and its really pretty sure to tell people no pork we're planning to do what we're actually have done install come she is not thinking like me for. the future I'm thinking for the children and their grandchildren.",0.64453125
ThomasGoetz_2010P, educate them or inform them but actually leads them to make better decisions better choices in their lives one part of medicine though has faced  the problem of behavior change pretty well and that's dentistry dentistry might seem and i think it is many dentists would have to acknowledge it's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine not a lot of cool sexy stuff happening in dentistry but they have really taken this problem of behavior change and solved it it's the one great preventive health success we have in our health care system  people brush and floss their teeth they don't do it as much as they should but they do it so i'm going to talk about one experiment that  in connecticut cooked up about thirty years ago so this is an old experiment but it's a really good one because it was very simple so it's an easy story to tell so these connecticut dentists decided that they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often and they were going to use one variable they wanted to scare them  talking to you about how we can tap a really underutilized resource in health care which is the patient they wanted to tell them how bad it would be if they didn't brush and floss their teeth they had a big patient population they divided them up into two groups they had a low fear population where they basically gave them a thirteen minute presentation all based in science but told them that if you didn't brush and floss your teeth you could get gum disease if you get gum disease you will lose your teeth but you'll get dentures and it won 't be that  that was the low fear group the high fear group they laid it on really thick they showed bloody gums they showed puss oozing out from between their teeth they told them that their teeth were going to fall out they said that they could have infections that would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies and ultimately yes they would lose their teeth they would get dentures or as i like to use the scientific term people because we are all patients we are all people was this the upshot of this experiment was that fear was not really a primary driver of the behavior at all the people who brushed and flossed their teeth not necessarily the people who were really scared about what would happen it's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity to change their behavior  so fear showed up as not really the driver it was the sense of efficacy it was a notion that really came out of albert bandura 's work who studied whether people  get a sense of empowerment the notion of efficacy basically boils down to one that if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior better health and that's a very important notion it's an amazing notion even doctors are patients at some point so i want to talk about that as an opportunity that we really have failed to engage with very well in this country we don't really know how to manipulate it though that well except maybe we do  so fear doesn't work right fear doesn't work and this is a great example of how we haven't learned that lesson at all this is a campaign from the american diabetes association this is still the way we're communicating messages about health i mean i showed my three year old this slide last night and he 's like papa why is an ambulance in these people 's homes and i had to explain they 're trying to scare people and i don't know if it works here 's what does work personalized information works again bandura recognized this years ago decades ago when you give people specific information about their health where they stand and where they want to get to where they might get to that path that notion of a path that tends to work for behavior change so let me just spool it out with personalized data personalized information that comes from an individual and then you need to connect it to their lives you need to connect it to their lives hopefully not in a fear based way but one that they understand okay i know where i sit i know where i'm situated and in fact worldwide if you want to get at the big part i mean from a public health level where my training is you're looking at we need to connect the information always with the action and then that action feeds back into different information and it creates of course a feedback loop now this is a very well observed and well established notion for the problem is that things in the upper right corner there personalized data it's been pretty hard to come by it's a difficult and expensive commodity and here 's how they work in the feedback loop so you start with the personalized data where the speed limit on the road where you are at that point is twenty five and of course you're going faster than that we always are we're always going above the speed limit the choice in this case is pretty simple we either keep going fast or we slow down we should probably slow down and that point of action is probably now we should take our foot off the peddle right now and generally we do these things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down they reduce speeds by about five to ten percent they last for about five miles  which case we put our foot back on the peddle but it works and it even has some health repercussions you blood pressure might drop a little bit maybe there's fewer accidents so there's public health benefits but by and large  this is a feedback loop that's so nifty and too rare because in health care most health care the data is very removed from the action it's very difficult to line things up so neatly  but we have an opportunity so i want to talk about i want to shift now to think about how we deliver health information in this country how we actually get information  this is a pharmaceutical ad actually it's a spoof it's not a real pharmaceutical ad nobody 's had the brilliant idea of calling their drug havidol quite yet but it looks completely right so it's exactly the way we get health information and pharmaceutical information and it just sounds perfect and then we turn the page of the magazine and we see this right we see this now this is the page the fda requires pharmaceutical companies to put into their ads or to follow their ads and to me this is one of the cynical exercises in medicine  because we know who among us would actually say that people read this and who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this  actually get anything out of it this is a bankrupt effort at communicating health information there is no good faith in so this is a different approach this is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at dartmouth medical school lisa schwartz and steven and saw that what works for cereal works for our food actually helps people understand what's in their food god forbid that we should use that same standard that we make cap 'n crunch live by and bring it to drug companies  so let me just walk through this quickly it says very clearly what the drug is for specifically who is it good for so you can start to personalize your understanding of whether the information is relevant to you or whether the drug is relevant to you you can understand exactly what the benefits are it isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what but you get the statistics for how effective it is and finally you understand what those choices are you can start to unpack the choices involved because of the side effects every time you take a drug you're walking into a possible side effect so it spells those out in very clean terms and that works  so i love this i love that drug facts box and so i was thinking about what's an opportunity that i could have to help people understand  those are all behaviors where people know what they're supposed to do they know what they're supposed to be doing but they're not doing it now behavior change is something that is a long standing problem in medicine it goes all the way back to aristotle  they're just not for us they're not for people they're not for patients they go right to doctors and god forbid i think many doctors if you really asked them they don't really understand all this stuff  this is the worst presented information you ask tufte and he would say yes this is the worst presentation of information possible what we did at wired was we went and i got our graphic design department to re imagine these lab reports so that's what i want to walk you through so this is the general blood work before and this is the after this is what we came up with the after takes what was four pages that previous slide was actually the first of four pages of data that's just the general blood work it goes on and on and on all these values all these numbers you don't know we use the notion of color it's an amazing notion that color could be used so on the top level you have your overall results the things that might jump out at you from the fine print then you can drill down and understand how actually we put your level in context and we use color to illustrate exactly where your value falls in this case this patient is slightly at risk of diabetes because color and personalized proximity to that information all those other values all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing we summarize we tell you that you're okay you're normal but you don't have to wade through it you don't have to go through the  and doctors hate it right i mean they complain about it all the time we talk about it in terms of engagement or non compliance when people don't take their pills when people don't follow doctors orders these are behavior problems  then we went to crp test in this case it's a sin of omission they have this huge amount of space and they don't use it for anything so we do now the crp test is often done following a cholesterol test or in conjunction with a cholesterol test so we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it so we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well it's a protein that shows up when your blood vessels might be inflamed which might be a risk for heart disease what you're actually measuring is spelled out in clean language then we use the information that's already in the lab report we use the person 's age and their gender to start to fill in the personalized risks so we start to use the data we have to run a very simple calculation that's on all sorts of online calculators to get a sense of what the actual risk is the last one i'll show you is a psa test here 's the before and here 's the after now a lot of our effort on this one as many of you probably know a psa test is a very controversial test it's used to test for prostate cancer but there are all sorts of reasons why your prostate might be enlarged  based on that and then again the follow up actions so our cost for this was less than dollar ten thousand all right that's what wired magazine spent on this why is wired magazine doing  last year they made profits of over seven hundred million dollars and over five hundred million dollars respectively  now this is not a problem of resources this is a problem of incentives we need to recognize that the target of this information should not be the doctor should not be the insurance company it should be the patient  it's the person who actually in the end is going to be having to change their lives and then start adopting new behaviors this is information that is incredibly powerful it's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change but we're not using it it's just sitting there  but for as much as clinical medicine agonizes over behavior change there's not a lot of work done in terms of trying to fix that problem so i want to just offer four questions that every patient should ask because i don't actually expect people to start developing these lab test reports but you can create your own feedback loop anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions can i have my results and the only acceptable answer is  what does this mean help me understand what the data is what are my options what choices are now on the table and then what's next  how do i integrate this information into the longer course of my life i've been talking today about latent information all this information that exists in the system that we're not putting to use but there are all sorts of other bodies of information that are coming online and we need to recognize the capacity of this information to engage people to help people and to change the course of so the crux of it comes down to this notion of decision making giving information to people in a form that doesn't just ,"I'm going to talking to you about how we can tap a really underutilized resourcing health care which is the patient or as I like to use the the scientific term because we are all patients we are all people leaving doctors are patients at some point so I want to talk about that as an opportunity that we really have have failed to engage with very well in the country you're looking at behavioral issues you looking at things where people are actually given information and they're not following through with it it's it's a problem that could manifest itself in diabetes obesity many forms of heart disease and behaviors for people who know what they're supposed to do right they know what they're supposed to be doing but they're not doing it that is a long-standing problem in in medicine it goes all the way back to Aristotle. and doctors hate to complain but it'll time we talked about it in terms of Engagement or non-compliance when people don't take their pills when people don't follow doctor's orders he's our behavior problems but forasmuch as clinical medicine kind of agonizes over Behavior change it there's not a lot of work done in terms of trying to fix that problem so the thumbs down to this notion of decision-making giving information to people in a form that something just kind of educate them or or inform them but actually leads them to make better decisions better choices in their life one part of medicine that has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well and I think it is somewhat of a mundane Backwater of medicine not a lot of cool sexy stuff happening in dentistry they have really taken care of this problem Behavior change and so it's the one great preventive health. except we having her healthcare people brush and floss their teeth they don't do it as much as I should but they do it so I'm going to the dentist in Connecticut about 3 years ago so this is an old expression but it's a really good one because it was very simple so it's an easy story to tell so these Connecticut dentist decided that they wanted to try to get people to brush their teeth and floss your teeth more often and they were going to use one variable they wanted to scare them they wanted to tell them how bad it would be if they didn't brush and floss their teeth Pizza population divided into two groups they had a low fear population where they basically gave him a 13-minute presentation all based on signs but I told them that if you didn't brush and floss your teeth you can get gum disease if you lose your teeth will get dentures in a monkey that then that was a low fear group group they laid it on really thick all right. Toscana moving out from between the teeth I told them that their teeth were going to fall out they said that they could have infections that would spread from there they would lose their teeth centers and if you weren't going to be able to eat corn on the cob steak for the rest of your life so go brush and floss your teeth right that was a message with experiment measured one other variable they wanted to capture one other variable which was the patient sense of efficacy this was the notion of whether the patient felt that they actually would go ahead and brush then floss their teeth so they ask them at the beginning you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program and people who said yeah yeah I'm pretty good about that you know I never get around to brushing and flossing as much as I should be characterized as a low efficacy so the upshot. was this gets out of this experiment was that fear was not really the primary driver of the behavior at all the people who brushed and flossed their teeth were not necessarily the people who were really scared about what would happen if the people who simply felt that they had the capacity to change their behavior so I want to isolate that because it was a great observation 30 years ago thirty years ago and and it's 100 in in research it was a notion that really came out of Albert bandura's work to who studied whether people can get a sense of empowerment to change the behavior and Health Care terms and characterize this as whether or not somebody feels that they see a path towards Better Health right that they can actually see their way towards getting better help noting a very important. amazing knows we don't really know how to manipulate it though that well except maybe we did. Sophia doesn't work right here doesn't work and this is a great example of how we haven't learned that lesson at all this is a campaign from the American Diabetes Association this is still the messages I said my three-year-old this slide last night he's like why is an ambulance in this these people's homes and I had to explain it sits there trying to scare people and I don't know if it works personalized information again been 2 years ago decades ago when you give people specific information about their health where they stand and where they want to get to where they might get to that path that notion of a path that has to work for Behavior change let me just pull it out a little bit. please start with personalized information that comes from an individual. and then you need to connect it to their lives you need to connect it to their live hopefully not in the fear-based play the one that they understand okay I know where I said I know where I'm situated and that doesn't just work for me numbers it's kind of kind of overload of health information that we're coming in days with but it actually hits home because it's better for Mason then needs to be connected to a choice I need to be connected to a range of options directions that we might go to trade off benefits finally we need to be presented with a clear point of a way to connect an information always with the action and then that action feeds back into different information and it creates of course there have been well-established Nelson. until now, give me an example of simple very simple example of how this works and we've all seen the speed limit signs all around especially these days as Radars are cheaper and they work in DC but please start with the personalized data where the road that the speed limit on the road that you are at that point is 25 and of course you're going faster than that right we always are we're always going above the choice in this case is pretty simple we keep going fast and we slow down we should probably slow down and the point of action is probably now we can take our foot off the pedal right now and generally we do these things are going to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down they they reduce speed by about 5 to 10 per cent They last about five miles from help your blood pressure might drop a little bit maybe there's fewer accidents or the public health benefits of buying large this is a feedback loop that so Nifty and then into rare. because in healthcare most Healthcare data is very removed from the act right it's very difficult kind of line things up some meat but we have an opportunity to talk about how we deliver health information in the country how we actually get information. this is a pharmaceutical add it's not a real Pharmacy glad nobody's had the brilliant idea of calling and their drugs have it all quite yet but it looks completely right right select so it's it's it's exactly the way we get health information and pharmaceutical information and it just sounds perfect and then we turn the page of the magazine and we see this right we see. This is the page that the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies to put into their ads for the five follow their ass and to me this is one of the most cynical exercises in medicine because we know who Among Us actually would honestly say that people read this and who Among Us would actually say that people who do try to read this this is it this is a bankrupt at communicating health information. there is no good faith in this. so it's a different approach this is approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at Dartmouth Medical School Lisa Schwartz and Steven Wilson and they created this thing called a drug facts they took inspiration from of all things Captain Crunch they went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal Roxboro food actually helps people understand what's in their food God forbid we should use that same standard that we make Captain Crunch live by and bring it to the drug companies right. so let me just walk through this quickly it says very clearly what the drug is for specifically who is it good for so you can start to personalize your understanding what the information is relevant you can understand exactly what the benefits are you know it isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what but it actually you get the statistics for how effective it is and finally you understand what those choices are you could unpack the choices involved because the side effects right every every time you take a druggie we were walking into a possible side effects so it's spelled those out and very clean term and that works so I if I'm a bit drunk that wasn't why I was thinking about what's an opportunity that that I could have to help people understand information what's another kind of latent body of information that's out there that people are really not putting tips. if I come up with this lab test results blood test results great source of information. Forbid I think many doctors could really get asked them if they don't really understand all this stuff either. this is this is the worst presented information and he would say yes this is this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible we went and got our graphic design Department to we imagine these wet lab reports so that's what I want to walk you through so this is a gentle blood work before this is what we came up with was four pages that previous slide with it was actually the first of four pages of data that so kind of the general blood work is all these numbers you don't know it this is a one-page summary. school's out everything is very we use the notion of color it's a it's an amazing notion that color could be used so on the top level you have your overall results the things that might jump out at you from the fine print then you can't roll down and get understand how I actually put your level in context and we use color to illustrate exactly where your value Falls in this case the station to slightly at risk of diabetes because they look up level E mango bear lipids and again understand where your overall cholesterol level is and then break down to the HDL and LDL if you so choose but again always using color and and personalize the proximity to that that information we are okay your normal but you don't have to Wade through you don't have to go through the junk. let me do to other parent portal things that kind of help fill in this feedback loop we help people understand in a little more detail what these values are and what they might indicate and then we go further that we tell them what they can do we give them some insight into what choices they can take what actions they can take. Sutter General blood work test. then we went to a CRP test in this case it's a it's a sin of omission have this huge amount of space and I don't use it for anything so we do now that CRP test is often done it following a cholesterol test or in conjunction with a class all day so we take the Bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page which is the way the doctor is going to be evaluated so we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well as a protein that shows up when your your blood vessels might be inflamed which might be a risk for heart disease what you're actually measuring is spelled out in clean language then we use the information is already in the lab reports we use the the person's age and their gender to start to fill in the personalized Ritz can we start to use the seeds in God we have to run a very simple calculation a calculator to get the sense of what the actual risk is. I'm the last one that also is a PSA test is the before and here's the after a lot of our effort on this one as many of you probably know PSA test is very controversial test it's used to test for prostate cancer but they're all sorts of reasons why your prostate might be enlarged and so we we spend a good deal of our time indicating that we again personalize the risks of this patient is in their 50s so we can actually give him a very precise estimate of what their risk for prostate cancer is in this case it's about 25% based on that and then again to follow back. so our cost me this was less than $10,000 spent on it. Diagnostics in lab for the two largest lab testing companies last year they made over $700 and over $500 respectively this is not a problem resources this is a problem of incentive right we need to recognize this information could not be the duct doctor in the end is going to be happy and having to change their lives and it starts about the new behaviors this is information that is incredibly powerful weapon lost. so I wanted to offer for questions every patient should ask because we don't actually expect people to start developing these lab test reports found but you can create your own free back with anybody can I have my results and the only acceptable answer is. yes what does this mean help me understand what the data is what are my options which choices are now on the table and then what's next how do I integrate this information into the longer course of my life. don't want to end up like a showing that people have the capacity to understand this information this is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people do not have to have the education level of people in this room Ordinary People are capable of understanding this information if we only go to the effort of presenting it to them in a form that they can engage and engagement is essential here because it's not just giving them information it's giving them an opportunity to act as it's different than compliance and we're totally different than the way we talk about behavior in medicine today and this information is out there I've been talking today about all this information about that existing system that were not put into use but they're all sorts of other bodies of information that are coming online you need to recognize the capacity of this information to engage people to help people and to change the course. thank you very much",0.78125
JosephNye_2010G,the industrial revolution in which while protecting ourselves with hard power we can organize with others in netorks to produce not only public goods but ways that will enhance our soft power so which meant that all of a sudden europe and america became the dominant center of the world  if one looks at the statements that have been made about this i am impressed that when hillary clinton described  the foreign policy of the obama administration she said that the foreign policy of the obama administration was going to be smart power as she put it using all the tools in our foreign policy tool box and if we're going to deal with these two great power shifts that i've the power shift represented by transition among states the power shift represented by diffusion of power away from all states  asia gradually returning to being more than half of the world 's population and more than half of the world 's product that's important and it's an important shift but let me tell you a little bit about the other shift that i'm talking about which is power diffusion now that's a big abstract number but to make it more real if the price of  had fallen as rapidly as the price of computing power you could buy a car today for five dollars now when the price of any technology declines that dramatically talk to you about power in this twenty one st century and basically what i'd like to tell you the barriers to entry go down anybody can play in the game the technology was there  but to be able to do it you had to be very rich a government a multinational corporation maybe the catholic church but you had to be pretty wealthy now anybody has that capacity which previously was restricted by price just to a few actors last time i looked it was something like a pound an hour and what that means is not that the age of the state is over the state still matters but the is that power is changing the state 's not alone there are many many actors some of that's good oxfam a great non governmental actor some of it's bad al qaeda another non governmental actor but think of what it does to how we think in traditional terms and concepts we think in terms of war and interstate war and there are two types of changes i want to discuss one is power transition it's worth noticing that a non state actor attacking the united states in two thousand and one so we're seeing a great change in terms of diffusion of power  now the problem is that we're not thinking about it in very innovative ways so let me step back and ask what's power power is simple the ability to affect others to get the outcomes you want or payment is what i call soft power and that soft power has been much neglected and much misunderstood and yet it's tremendously important which is change of power amongst states and they are the simple version of the message is it's moving from west indeed if you can learn to use more soft power you can save a lot on carrots and sticks for example the great oxford historian who taught here at this university a j p taylor defined a great power as a country able to prevail in war but we need a new narrative if we're to understand power in the twenty one st century it's not just prevailing at war though war still persists it's not whose army wins it's also whose story wins and we have to think much more in terms of narratives and whose narrative is going to be effective  now let me go back to the question of power that we use now tend to be the rise and fall of the great powers and the current narrative is all about the rise of china and the decline of the united states indeed with the two thousand and eight financial crisis many people said this was the beginning of the end of american power the tectonic plates of world politics were shifting  and president medvedev of russia for example pronounced in two thousand and eight this was the beginning of the end of united states power the other is power diffusion but in fact this metaphor of decline is often very misleading if you look at history in recent history  the way power is moving from all states west or east to non state actors those two things are the huge shifts of power in our century the rust belt economy of the midwest to the silicon valley economy of california that was the end of america but in fact what we've seen is none of those were true indeed people were over enthusiastic in the early twenty hundreds thinking america could do anything which led us into some disastrous foreign policy adventures and now we're back to decline again the moral of this story is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline tell us a lot more they do about reality if we try to focus on the reality then what we need to focus on is what's really happening in terms of china and the united states  so we've got what seventeen more years to go or so before china 's bigger now someday  with a billion point three people getting richer they are going to be bigger than the united states but be very careful of these projections  such as the goldman sachs projection as though that gives you an accurate picture of power transition in this century tell you about the composition of the economy china still has large areas and i want to tell you about them each separately and then how they interact and why in the end there may be some good news and per capita income is a better measure of the sophistication of the economy and that the chinese won 't catch up or pass the americans until somewhere in the latter part if you're sitting in japan or in new delhi or in hanoi your view of the rise of china is a little different than if you're sitting in beijing indeed one of the advantages that the americans will have in terms of power in asia is all those countries want an american insurance policy against the rise of china it's as though mexico and canada were hostile neighbors to the united states which they're not so these simple projections of the goldman sachs type are not telling us what we need to know about power transition but you might ask well so what in any case why does it matter who cares is this just a game that diplomats and academics play the answer is it matters quite a lot because if you believe in decline and you get the answers wrong on this the facts not the myths you may have policies which are very dangerous  when we talk about power transition two and a half millennia ago what caused it thucydides the great historian of the the peloponnesian war said it was the rise in the power of athens and the fear it created in sparta we often talk about the rise of asia world war one the great conflagration in which the european state system tore itself apart and destroyed its centrality in the world that that was caused by the rise in the power of germany and the fear that it created in britain so there are people who are telling us this is going to be reproduced today that what we're going to see is the same thing now in this century no it really should be called the recovery or return of asia but also if you have this belief and it creates a sense of fear it leads to overreaction and the greatest danger we have of managing this power transition of the shift toward the east is fear to paraphrase franklin roosevelt from a different context  the greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself we don't have to fear the rise of china or the return of asia if we looked at the world and if we have policies in which we take it in that larger historical perspective we're going to be able to manage this process  let me say a word now about the distribution of power and how it relates to power diffusion and then pull these two types together if you ask how is power distributed in the world today it's distributed much like a three dimensional chess game  top board you'd find that more than half of the world 's people lived in asia and they made more than half the world 's product  economic power among states power is multi polar there are balancers the u s europe china japan can balance each other the bottom board of this three dimensional the board of transnational relations things that cross borders outside the control of governments things like climate change drug trade financial flows pandemics all these things that cross borders outside the control of governments there nobody 's in charge it makes no sense to call this unipolar or multi polar power is chaotically distributed and the only way you can solve these problems and this is where many greatest challenges are coming in this century is through cooperation through working together which means that soft power becomes more important that ability to organize networks to deal with these kinds of problems and to be able to get cooperation my gain is your loss and vice versa power can also be positive sum where your gain can be my gain if china develops greater energy security and greater capacity to deal with its problems of carbon emissions  that's good for us as well as good for china as well as good for everybody else so empowering china to deal with its own problems of carbon is good for everybody not a zero sum i win you lose it's one in which we can all gain so as we think about power in this century we want to get away from this view that it's all i win you lose now i don't mean to be pollyannaish about this wars persist power persists military power is important keeping balances is important all this is still persists hard power is there and it will remain but unless you learn how to mix hard power with soft power into strategies that i call smart power you're not going to deal with the new kinds of problems that so the key question that we need to think about as we look at this is how do we work together to produce global public goods things from which all of us can benefit how do we define our national interests so that it's not just zero sum but positive in that sense if we define our interests for example for the united states the way britain defined its interests in the nineteenth century keeping an open trading system keeping a monetary stability keeping freedom of the seas those were good for britain they were good for others as well ,I better talk to you about the power in this twenty-first century and basically what I'd like to tell you is that power is changing and there are two types of changes I want to discuss one is power transition which is change of power among states and they are the simple version of the message is it's moving from west to east the other is power diffusion the way power is moving from all states west or east to non-state actors those two things are the huge shifts of power in our century and I want to tell you about them each separately and then how they interact and why in the end there may be some good news. when we talk about power transition. we often talk about the rise of Asia. it really should be called the recovery or return of Asia if we looked at the world in 1880 find it more than half of the world's people lived in Asia and they made more than half of the world's product now fast-forward to 1900. half the world's people more than half still live in Asia but they're now making only a fifth of the world's product what happened the Industrial Revolution which meant that all of a sudden Europe and America became the dominant center of the world what we're going to see in the 21st century is Asia gradually returning to being more than half of the world's population and more than half of the world's product that's important and it's an important shift but let me tell you a little bit about the other ship that I'm talking about which is powered by Fusion. don't understand power diffusion. put this in your mind Computing and Communications costs have fallen a thousand fold between 1970 and the beginning of this Century that's a big abstract number but to make it more real if a price of an automobile had fallen as rapidly as the price of computing power you could buy a car today for $5. that when the price of any technology declines that dramatically. the barriers to entry go doubt anybody can play in the game. so in 1970 if you wanted to communicate from Oxford to Johannesburg to New Delhi to Brasilia and anywhere simultaneously you could do it the technology was there but to be able to do it you had to be very rich a government a multinational corporation maybe the Catholic church but you had to be pretty wealthy anybody has that capacity which previously was restricted by Price just to a few actors if they have the price of entry into an internet cafe the last time I looked it was something like a pound an hour and if you have Skype it's free. so capabilities than once restricted are now available to everyone and what that means is not that the age of the state is over the state still matters but the stage is crowded the states not alone there many many actors some of that good Oxfam a great non-governmental actor some of its bad Al-Qaeda another non-governmental actor. but think of what it does to how we think in traditional terms and Concepts we think in terms of war and Interstate war and you can think back to 1941 when the government of Japan attack the United States at Pearl Harbor. it's worth noticing that a non-state actor attacking the United States in 2001 killed more Americans than the government of Japan did in 1941 you might think of that as the privatization of War. so we're seeing a great change in terms of diffusion of power. now the problem is that we're not thinking about it and very innovative ways so let me step back and ask what's power. power is simply the ability to affect others to get the outcomes you want and you do it in three ways you can do it with threats of Correction sticks you can do it with payments carrots or you can do it by getting others to want what you want and that ability to get others to want what you want to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment is what I call soft power. and that soft power has been much neglected and much misunderstood and yet it's tremendously important indeed if you can learn to use more soft power you can save a lot on carrots and sticks. traditionally the way people thought about power was primarily in terms of military power for example the great Oxford historian who taught here at this University ajp Taylor Define the great power as a country able to Prevail in war. we need a new narrative it weird understand power in the 21st century it's not just for availing of war the war still persists it's not whose army with it's also Pooh story wins and we have to think much more in terms of narratives and whose narrative is going to be effective. now let me go back to the question of power. transition between states and what's happening there the narratives that we use now tend to be the rise and fall of the great powers and the current narrative is all about the rise of China and the decline of the United States deed with the 2008 financial crisis many people said this was the beginning of the end of American power at the tectonic plates of world politics were shifting and president for example pronounced in 2008 this was the beginning of the end of the United States power. but in fact this metaphor of decline is often very misleading if you looked at history in recent history you'll see that the cycles of belief in American decline come and go every 10 or 15 years or so in 1958 after the Soviets put up Sputnik it was that the end of America in 1973 with the oil embargo in the closing of the gold window that was the end of America in the 1980s is America went through a transition in the Reagan. Between. the Rust Belt economy of the Midwest to the Silicon Valley economy of California that was the end of America but in fact what we've seen is none of those were true indeed people over enthusiastic in the early 2000 thinking America could do anything which let us into some disastrous foreign policy adventures and now we're back to decline again the moral of the story is All these narratives about rise and fall into Klein tell us a lot more about psychology than they do about reality. we try to focus on the reality then what we need to focus on is what's really happening in terms of China and the United States Goldman Sachs has projected that China the Chinese economy will surpass that of the US by 2027 so we've got more years to go or so before trying to figure out some day with a billion point three people getting richer they are going to be bigger than United States but be very careful about these projections such as the Goldman Sachs projection is though that gives you an accurate picture of power transition in this Century first of all it's a linear projection you know everything says here's the growth rate of China here's the growth rate of u.s. area codes strafe on it. history is not linear they're often bumps in the road accidents along the way the second thing is that the Chinese economy passes US economy in let's say 20-30 bay that will be a measure of totally Comics eyes but not a per capita. I will tell you about the composition of Utah China still has large areas of under development and for capita income is a better measure of the sophistication of the economy and that's the Chinese won't catch up for past the Americans until somewhere in the latter part after 2050 of this century. the other point that's worth noticing is how one dimensional this projection is it looks that he cannot make Power measured by GDP doesn't tell you much about military power doesn't tell you much about soft power it's all one dimensional and also when we think about the rise of Asia or return of Asia's I called it a little bit earlier remembering Asia's not one thing if you're sitting in Japan or in New Delhi or it had died. your view of the rise of China is little different than if you're sitting in Beijing indeed one of the advantages the Americans will have in terms of power and Asia is all those countries want an American insurance policy against the rise of China it's as though Mexico and Canada were hostile neighbors to the United States which they're not really simple projections of the Goldman Sachs type are not telling us what we need to know about power transition. but you might ask what was so what in any case why is it matter who cares is this just a game that diplomats and academics play the answer is it matters quite a lot because if you believe in Decline and you get the answers wrong on this the facts not the miss you may have policies which are very dangerous let me give you an example from history. the Peloponnesian War was the great conflict in which the Greek city-states system tore itself apart. two and a half but Lenny ago. what caused it to cities the great historian of the Peloponnesian War said it was the rise in the power of Athens and the fear it created in Sparta notice both halves that explanation many people argue that the 21st century is going to repeat the 20th century in which World War great conflagration in which the European State system tore itself apart and destroyed its centrality in the world that that was caused by the rise in the power of Germany and the fear it created in Britain so their people are telling us this is going to be reproduced today but we're going to see is the same thing now in this century. no I think that's wrong it's bad history for one thing Germany it surpassed Britain in industrial strength by 1900s I said earlier but also if you have this belief and it creates a sense of fear at least over reaction and the greatest danger we have a managing this power transition of the shift toward the East is fear to paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt from a different context the greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself we don't have to fear the rise of China or the return of Asia and if we have policies in which we take it when that larger historical perspective we're going to be able to manage this process. let me say a word now about the distribution of power and how it relates to power diffusion and then pull these two types together if you ask how is power distributed in the world today it's distributed much like a three-dimensional chess game. top board. military power among states do United States is the only superpower that's likely to remain that way for two or three decades trying to replace the us on this military for Middle Board of this three-dimensional chess game economic power among states power is multipolar they are balancers the US Europe China Japan can balance each other the bottom Board of this three-dimensional chess game the board of transnational license things across borders outside the control of government things like climate change drug trade Financial flows pandemics all these things across borders outside the control of governments. they're nobody's in charge that makes no sense to call this is unipolar and multipolar power is chaotically distributed and the only way you can solve these problems and this is where many of our greatest challenges are coming in this century is through cooperation through working together which means its soft power becomes more important that ability to organize networks to deal with these kinds of problems and be able to get cooperation another way of putting it is that as we think the power in the 21st century we want to get away from the idea that power is always zero Sun my gain is your loss and vice-versa power can also be positive some where your game can be my game. skip trying to develop greater energy security and greater capacity to deal with its problems of carbon emissions that's good for us as well as good for China as well as good for everybody else so empowering China to deal with its own problems of carpet is good for everybody and it's not a zero-sum I win you lose this is one in which we had all day so it's we think about power in this Century we want to get away from this view that it's all I win you lose. I don't mean to be Pollyanna sure about this Wars persist power possessed military power is important keeping balances is important all this still persist hard power is there and it will remain. but unless you learn how to mix hard power with soft power in two strategies that I call Smart power you're not going to deal with a new kinds of problems that were facing so the key question that we need to think about this we look at this is how do we work together to produce Global public goods things from which all of us can benefit how we Define our national interests so that it's not just a zero-sum but positive so in that sense if we Define our interests for example for the United States the way Britain to find its interest in the 19th century keeping an open trading system keeping monetary stability keeping Freedom of the Seas those were good for Britain they were good for others as well and in the 21st century you have to do an analog to that how do we produce Global public goods which are good for us but good for everyone at the same time and that's going to be easy good news to mention of what we need to. think about as we think of power in the twenty-first century there ways to Define our interests in which while protecting our self with hard power we can organize with others in network to produce not only public goods ways that will enhance our soft power so if one looks at the statements that have been made about this depressed that would Hillary Clinton described the foreign policy of the Obama Administration she said the foreign policy of the Obama Administration who is going to be smart power as she put it using all the tools in our foreign policy tool box. and if we're going to deal with these two great power ships that I've strived the powershift represented by transition among states the power shift represented by diffusion of power away from all states we're going to have to develop a new Narrative of power in which we combine hard at soft power into strategies of smart power and that's the good news I have we can do that thank you very much. the position of a watch is a function of its movement for Rolex and for Hans wilsdorf to guarantee the Precision of a timepiece the pressing question was how to protect the movement itself the elements with the creation of the perfect match. a Rolex Oyster was born over the years I feel changes in the design continue to improve the oyster adding more Comfort while keeping the style contemporary along with more functions with the fastest show the dates for small aperture on the face it was also the first wristwatch to spend the day of the week info. in the early 1950s Rolex developed a professional watches whose functions went far beyond telling the time launched in 1953 the Submariner with the first Rolex watch to prove to a depth of 330 feet. already on an incredible journey of innovation and design decided to push the boundaries even further made history the submersible 6800 a Rolex deepsea special with strap to the exploration let alone seen in 1967. the Submariner is redesigning and the case features of you you need directional rotatable bezel what is Sarah Chrome disc. it is with the painted Rolex ring up system the Rolex deepsea safely descend to 12800 feet.

LauraTrice_2008,so the question is why was i blocking it why were other people blocking it why can i say i 'll take my steak medium rare i need size six shoes but i won 't say would you praise me this and it's because i'm giving you critical data about me i'm telling you where i'm insecure i'm telling you where i need your help and i'm treating you my inner circle like you're the enemy because what can you do with that data you could neglect me you could abuse it or you could actually meet my need and i took my bike into the bike store i love this same bike and they'd do something called truing the wheels the guy said you know when you true the wheels it's going to make the bike so much better i get the same bike back  and they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels i've had for two and a half years and my bike is like new so i'm going to challenge all of you i want you to true your wheels be honest about the praise that you need to hear what do you need to hear go home to your wife go ask her what does she need go home to your husband what does he  go home and ask those questions and then help the people around you and it's simple and why should we care about this we talk about world peace how can we have world peace with different cultures different languages about the importance of i think it starts household by household under the same roof so let 's make it right in our own backyard and i want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands great mothers friends daughters sons and maybe somebody 's never said that to you but you've done a really really good job and thank you for being here  praise admiration and thank you and having it be specific and genuine and the way i got interested in this was i noticed in myself when i was growing up and until about a few years ago that i would want to say thank you to someone i would want to praise them i would want to take in their praise of me and i'd just stop it and i asked myself why i felt shy i felt embarrassed  and then my question became am i the only one who does this so i decided to investigate their core wound is their father died without ever saying he 's  but then they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him but he never told the son it's because he didn't know needed to hear it so my question is why don't we ask for the things that we need i know a gentleman married for twenty five years who 's longing to hear his wife say thank you for being the bread winner so i can stay home with the kids for that and a friend of mine april who i've had since kindergarten she thanks her children for doing their chores and she said why wouldn't i thank it even though they're supposed to do it ,hi I'm here to talk to you about the importance of Praise admiration and thank you and have you be specific in genuine and we got interested in this was I noticed in myself when I was growing up until about a few years ago that I would want to say thank you to someone I would want to praise him I wanted to take in their Praise of me I had to stop it and I asked myself why I'm a felt so I felt embarrassed and then my question became am I the only one who does a side to side to investigate. I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction and sometimes it comes down to something as simple as their core wound is their father died with her without ever saying he's proud of them but then they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him but he never told his son because he didn't know that is so I needed to hear it so my question is why don't we ask for the things that we need I know a gentleman married for twenty-five years who's lying to his wife say thank you for being the breadwinner so I could stay home with the kids but won't ask I know a woman who is good at this she once a week me to their husband says I would like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids and he goes as he does this is great this is great and praise really does have to be genuine but she takes responsibility for that and a friend of mine April though I've had since kindergarten she thinks her children for doing their chores and she said why wouldn't I think it even though they're supposed to do it so the question is. why was I blocking at why were other people blocking at why can I say I'll take my steak medium rare I need size 6 shoes but I won't say would you praise me this way and it's because I'm giving you critical data about me I'm telling you where I'm insecure I'm telling you where I need your help and I'm treating you my inner circle like you're the enemy because what can you do with that data you could neglect me you could have use it or you can actually meet my neat and I took my bike to the bike store I love this same bike and they do something called truing the wheels the guy said you know when you to the wheel that's going to make the bike so much better I get the same bike back and they taken all the little dwarfs out of those same wheels and had for two and a half years of my bike is like new so I'm going to challenge all of you I want you to True your wheels be honest about the praise that you need to hear what do you need to hear go home to your wife don't ask her what does she need to go home to your husband what does he need. go home and ask those questions then help the people around you and it's simple why and why should we care about this we talked about world peace how can we have world peace with different cultures different languages I think it starts household by household under the same roof so let's make it right in our own backyard no one to thank all of you in the audience for being great husband's great Mother's friend's daughter's son's and maybe somebody's never said that to you but you've done a really really good job and thank you for being here and just showing up and changing the world with your ideas thank you,0.8268228769302368
SasaVucinic_2005G,you do it you start it in the states because it 's you know concepts are very very close to american minds but you can actually bring it to europe too you can bring it to asia you can once you have all of those different points you can make it easy for investors put all of those bonds at one place and they sit down and click  now take it to the last step once you have all of that put together there's not one reason why you couldn't actually have a market place for all of that you can dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way and in that way you organize the financing so there are no dark rooms no blind people running around to find each other thank  countries can lose stars from their flags but they can also lose press freedom as i guess americans among us can tell us more about but that's totally another and separate topic so i can go back to my story an event seen from one point of view gives one impression b ninety two the only independent for that matter the only electronic media in the country and i guess we were sharing we had that but what they really do which is very powerful and that is what governments in the late nineties started doing if they don't like independent media companies you know they threaten your advertisers  they threaten your advertisers market forces are actually you know destroyed and the advertisers do not want to come no matter how much does it makes sense for them do not want to come and advertise and you have a problem making ends meet at that time at beginning of seen from another point of view it gives quite a different impression we had that problem which was you know survival below one side but what was really painful for me was remember beginning of the nineties yugoslavia is falling apart we were sitting over there with a country in a downfall in a slow motion downfall and we all had all of that on tapes we had the ability to understand what was going on we were actually recording history the problem was that we had to retape that history a week later because if we did not we could not afford enough tapes to keep archives of that history so if i gave you that picture i don't want to go too long on that in that context i know at that time about media systems i would think media systems were organizations which means they should help so i prepared two plans for that meeting two strategic plans the small one and the big one the small one was i just wanted him to help us get those damn tapes so we can keep that archive for next fifty years the big plan was to ask him for a one million dollar loan because i thought still maintain that serious and independent media companies are great business and i thought that b ninety two will survive be a great company once milosevic is gone which turned out to be true it's now probably either the biggest or the second biggest media company in the country and i thought that the only thing that we needed at that time was one million dollar loan to take us through those hard times to make a long story short the gentleman comes into the office great suit and  i gave him what i thought was a brilliant explanation of the political situation and  how hard and difficult the war will be actually i underestimated the atrocities i have to admit anyway after that whole big long explanation  it's a great clip isn't it and i found that in twenty nine seconds it tells more about the power the only question he had for me and this is not a joke is are we paying royalties after we broadcast music of michael jackson that was really the only question he had he left and i remember being  in your face and somebody must have thought of it somebody must have started something like that and i thought i'm just dumb and i cannot find it you know in my defense there was no google at that time you could not just google in ninety one have a meeting with george soros trying for the third time to convince him that he should his foundation should invest in something that should operate like a media bank and basically what i was saying is very simple you know forget about charity it doesn't work forget about handouts twenty thousand dollars do not help anybody what you should do is you should treat media companies as a business it's business anywhere media business or any other business it needs to be capitalized and what these guys need actually is access to capital and importance of independent media than i could say in an hour so i thought that it will be good to start with  so third meeting arguments are pretty well exercised at the end of the meeting he says look it is not going to work you will never see your money back but my foundations will put five hundred thousand dollars so you can test the idea see and see that it will not work he said i'll give you a rope to hang yourself i knew two things after that meeting first under no circumstances i want to hang myself and second that i have no idea how to make it work you see at the level of a concept it was a great concept but it's one thing to have a concept it's a totally separate thing to actually make it work so i had absolutely no idea how that could actually work had the wrong idea i thought that we can be a bank you see banks i don't know if there are any bankers over here i apologize in advance the best job in the world you know you find somebody who is respectable and has a lot of money you give them more money  repay you that over a time you collect interest and do nothing in between so i thought why don't we get into that business and also start with a little bit of statistics according to relevant researchers eighty three percent of the population of this planet lives in the societies without independent press so here we are having our first client brilliant first independent newspaper in slovakia  it's a daily newspaper with a deadline of four p m that means that they have no sports they have no latest news circulation goes it's a kind of very nice sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper they come to us with a request for a loan they want to the only way for them to survive is to get a printing press and we said there's that's fine let 's meet you'll bring us your business plan which eventually they did we start the meeting i get these two pieces of paper not like this a four format so it's much bigger a lot of numbers there a lot of numbers but however you put it you know the numbers do not make any sense and that's the best they could do we were the best that they could do so that is how we understood what our method is it's not a bank we had to actually go into these companies and earn our return by fixing by establishing management systems by providing all that knowledge how do you run a business on one side while they all know how to run how to create content just quickly on the results over these ten years we do it in seventeen countries of the developing world and here is the most stunning number return rate the one that soros was so worried about ninety seven percent from printing presses to transmitters what is most important is  think about that number eighty three percent of the population on the whole planet does not really know what is going on in their countries we do it either in form of loans equities lease whatever is appropriate for you know supporting anybody but what is most important here is who do we finance we believe that in the last ten years companies that we've financed are actually the best media companies in the developing world that is a who is who list and i could spend hours talking about them  working in eastern and central europe and moved to russia our first loan in russia was in chelyabinsk i'll bet half of you have never heard for that place in the south of russia there's a guy called boris nikolayevich kirshin who is running an independent newspaper there city was closed until early nineties because of all things they were producing glass for tupolev planes  anyway he 's running independent newspaper there after two years working with us he becomes the most respected newspaper in that small place  governor comes to him one day actually invites him to come to his office he goes and sees the governor the governor says boris nikolayevich can you please give me your newspaper for next nine months because i have elections there are elections coming up in nine months i will not run but it's very important for me who is going to succeed me so give me the paper for nine months i'll give it back to you i have no interest in being in media business how much would that cost not for sale the governor says we will close you boris nikolayevich says no you cannot do it six months later the newspaper was closed  luckily we had enough time to help boris nikolayevich take all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one to get all the subscription lists  rehire staff so what the governor got was an empty shell but that and if you are a banker for independent media so sounds like a great story somewhere down the road we opened a media management center we started our media lab sounds like a real great story but there is a second angle to that the second angle like in this clip if you take the camera above not too much is it it's actually just a drop in the sea because when you think about the importance some of the issues that we were talking about last night this last session we had about africa and  government accountability corruption how do you fight corruption giving voice to unheard to poor  it's why independent media is in business and it's why it was invented so from that perspective what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can  identify now ours is just one story i'm sure that in this room there are like fifteen other wonderful stories that is just to understand how big and important this problem is now as well as i can what the problem is and it's called fundraising imagine that this third of this room filled with people who represent different foundations imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations  doing very important work now imagine that every second person over here is deaf does not hear and switch the lights off  now that is how difficult it is to match people from this side of the room with people of that side of the room  so we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform to totally rethink invented and we came up with this idea of issuing bonds press freedom bonds if there are investors willing to  finance us government budget deficit why wouldn't we find investors willing to finance press freedom deficit  decided to do it this fall we will issue them probably in denominations of one thousand dollars i don't want to advertise them too much that's not the point but the point is if we ever survive to actually issue them find enough investors that this can be of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies that represent seventeen percent i think should  success there's nothing stopping the next organization to start to issue bonds next spring and those can be environmental bonds  and then two weeks later iqbal quadir can issue his electricity in bangladesh bonds and before you know it any social cause can be actually financed in this way now we do daydreaming in eleven thirty with fifty five seconds left but let 's take the idea further ,"an event scene for one point of view gives one impression. theme from another point of view it gives quite a different impression. but it's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand what's going on. it's a great flip isn't that and I thought that in 29 seconds and tells more about the power of any importance of Independent Media that I could say in. an hour so I thought that it would be good to start with it and also start with a little bit of Statistics according to relevant research has 83% of the population of this planet lives in the societies without independent press. think about that number eighty-three percent of the population of the whole planet does not really know what is going on in their countries information today get gets filtered for somebody who get a Twist that information or colors that information that's something with it so they're deprived of understanding their reality. Just understand how big the important and important this problem is now those. all of you who are lucky enough to to live in those societies that represent 17% I think she would enjoy it until last in a Sunday morning give flip the paper schedule cappuccino enjoy life while it lasts cuz it is required yesterday countries can lose stars from their their Flags but they can also lose. press Freedom as I guess Americans Among Us can tell us more about but that's totally another and separate topic so I can go back to my story. my story starts story I want to share starts in 1991 and that time I was running benighted to the only independent for that matter the only Electronic media in the country and I guess we were sharing we had that regular life of the only dependent media in in in the country operating in a hostile environment where government really wants to make your life miserable and a different ways controlled you always have somebody who never leaves your office but what they really do which is very powerful and that is where governments in late late night to start doing if they don't like Independent Media companies by market forces are actually in a destroyed. and then advertisers do not want to come no matter how much does it make sense for them to not want to come in at the ties and you have a problem making ends meet at that time in beginning of a night this week. we have that problem which was so I have a blue one side lock what was really painful for me was remember beginning of night is Yugoslavia is falling apart we were sitting over there with country in the downfall in a slow-motion down for and we all had all of that and tapes we had the ability to understand what was going on we've actually recording history the problem was that we had to retype that history week later cuz we did not we could not afford enough Dave's to keep Archives of nethys History if I give you that picture I don't want to go too long on that in that context a gentleman came to my office at that time it was still 1991 she was running one media systems organization which is still in business management is to visit in business and a media systems for organizations means. to help you. should I prepare to plans for that meeting to strategic plans the small one and a big one small one was I just wanted him to help us get those damned thieves so we can keep that archive next 50 years the big plan was asking for a $1000000 loan company is a great business and I thought it'd be 92 Will Survive and be a great company once music is gone which turned out to be true is now probably either the biggest or the second-biggest media company in the country. and I saw that the only thing that we needed at that time is $1000000 loan to take us through those hard times to make a long story short judgment comes into the office great suit and tie I gave him what I thought was a brilliant explanation of. the political situation and explain how hard the difficulty war will be actual I underestimated the atrocities I have to admit the only question you had for me and this is not the joke is are we paying grilled is not to be broadcasting music of Michael Jackson. that was really the only question he had she left and I remember being gone. being. actually very angry with myself because I thought there must be an institution in the world that is providing loans to Media companies it's so obvious straight in your face and somebody must have thought of it somebody must have started something like that than I thought I'm just dumb and I cannot find it. you know you might have sensed there was no Google at that time you couldn't just move late night to one that's actually my problem we go from here to five I have I left the country I have a meeting with George Soros strength for the third time to convince him that. she said she's Foundation should invest in something that should operate like a media bank and basically what I was saying is very simple not forget about United doesn't work forget about candidates $20,000 do not help anybody what you should do is you should treat media companies as a business is business anywhere media business or any other business United needs to be capitalized and what these guys need actually is access to Capital. third meeting arguments are pretty well exercised at the end of the meeting he says luck it is not going to work you will never see your money back but my foundations will put $500,000 so you can test the idea see and see that it will not work he said they'll give you a rope to hang yourself. I knew two things after that meeting first and then no circumstances I want to hang myself and a second that I have no idea how make how to make a quick see at the level of a concept it was a great concept but it's one thing to have a concept is totally separate thing to actually make it work so I have absolutely no idea how that could actually work had the wrong idea we can be a back seat Banks apologize if it's the best job in the world and now you find somebody who is respectable guy has a lot of money you give them more money. they repay you that over the time you collect interest do nothing in between us I thought why don't we get into that business. so here we are having our first client brilliant first in the bad newspaper in Slovakia government cutting them off from all the printing facilities in Bratislava Jose The Daily newspaper that has to be printed 400 km away from the capitol to Daily Newspaper with deadline of 4 p.m. that means they have no Sports they have no latest news circulation goes down it's a kind of very nice sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper they come to us with the request for loan they want to the only way for them to survive is to get the printing press and the recent days that's fine let's meet you will bring us your business plan which eventually they did we start the meeting. I get these two pieces of paper not like this A4 format so it's much bigger. a lot of numbers there a lot of numbers but however you put it in a would not make any sense and that's the best they could do really the best they could do so that is how we start the bank we have to we have to actually go into these companies and earn our return by fixing them establishing Management Systems by providing all that knowledge how do you run the business on one side while they all know how to run how to create content.just quickly on the results. over these ten years 40 million dollars in a fordable financing average interest rate 5 to 6% lately we are going wild charging 7% from time to time we do 18 17 countries of the developing world and here is the most stunning a number return rate the one that service was so worried about 97%. 97% of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time company would need from printing presses to transmitters what is most important is. we do it either in form of loans equities lease whatever is appropriate for for supporting anybody but what is most important is who do we Finance we believe that in the last 10 years companies at 3 financed actually the best media companies in the developing world that is the who is who list and I could spend hours talking about them cuz they kind of Heroes and I can but I'll give you just maybe one and depending on time and I'll give you three samples could we work with suicidal working in Eastern and Central Europe move to Russia our first Loan in Russia was in Chelyabinsk I bet half of your never heard of that place in the south of Russia is a guy cold but it's Nicole I would finish a running Independent Newspaper their city was closed until the early nineties because. of all the things that were producing glass for tupolev planes. anyway she's running Independent Newspaper there after two years working with us he becomes the most respected newspaper in that smoke place. Governor comes to him one day I actually might seem to come to his office he goes and sees the governor governor says in our district and I want to offer you a deal can you please give me your newspaper for next time months because I have elections elections coming up in that nine months I will not friend but it's very important for me who is going to succeed me to give me the paper for nine months I'll give it back to you I have no interest in being in media business how much would that cost. what is the closest GameStop for sale Governor says we will close you know you cannot do it six months later. luckily we had enough time to help borders coronavirus take all the assets out of that company in bringing into a new one to get all the subscription list rehire staff so what governor got is an empty shell but that is what happens if you're in business of Independent Media and if you are a banker for Independent Media.sounds like a great story somewhere down the road reopened media Management Center we started our media live sounds like a griot great story but there is a s s angle to that there's a camera above start thinking about those numbers again a million dollars over 10 years spread over 17 countries. don't have too much as it actually just dropped in the sea cuz when you think about the important some of the issues that we were talking about last night this last session we had about the African these hypothetical 50 billion dollars destined for Africa all of those half of those problems mentioned last night government accountability corruption how do you fight corruption giving voice to Ann heard to pour it in business and it's why it was invented so from that perspective what you did is just really one drop in the sea or that need that we can we can. identify hours is just one story I'm sure that in this room there like 15 other wonderful stories of nonprofit spring spectacular work here's where the problem. and I'll explain to you. as well as I can for the problem is and it's called fundraising imagine that this third of this room is filled with people who represent different foundations. imagine 2/3 over here running these excellent organizations doing very important work does not here and switch the lights off now that is how difficult it is to match people from this side of the room with people of that side of the room. so we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reformed totally rethink. fundraising and I still have people running in this dark trying to find their own match will be willing to has the same goals instead of all of that with others and something you need to be. invented and we came up with this idea of issuing bonds press Freedom bonds if. there are investors willing to finance. US government budget deficits why would we find a masters willing to finance press recent episode will decided to do this fall we will issue them in traveling in the nation's of $2,000 I don't want to advertise them too much to send a point but the point is if we ever survive to actually show them find enough investors this can be considered a success is nothing stopping the next organization to start to issue bonds next spring and those can be environmental bonds and then 2 weeks later can you shoot his electricity Bangladesh part and before you know it any social cause can be actually fine ass to this way now we do daydreaming in 11:30 with 55 seconds left but let's dig the idea further you do you started in the States because it's in our concept very very close to America. mine's would you can actually bring it to Europe to you can bring it to Asia you can once you have all of those different point you can make it easy for investors put all of those Bonds in one place and they sit down and click once you have more than 10 of them you have to develop some kind of a metrics what do investors get on one side Financial on the other side of the social so did bring the idea of some kind of of of rating agency Morningstar type says you're not a social impact of a spectacular 5-stars Financial they give you 1% only one star. now take it to the last step once you have all of that for together there's not one reason why you couldn't actually have a Marketplace for all of that. are you cannot dispose of all of those Bonds in a pretty quick way and in that we organized a financing so there are no dark rooms no blind people running around to find each other thank you",0.7786458730697632
JosephPine_2004,long distance telephone service sold on price price price fast food restaurants with all their value pricing what that means is that it's time to move to a new level of economic value time to go beyond the goods and the services and use in that same heuristic what happens when you customize a service what happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person that's exactly what they need at this  in time then you can't help but make them go wow you can't help but turn it into a memorable event you can't help but turn it into an experience a very fundamental change that is going on in the very fabric of the modern economy and to talk about that i'm going to go back to the beginning so we're shifting to an experience economy where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering now most places that i talk to when i talk about experience i talk about disney the world 's premier experience stager i talk about theme restaurants and experiential retail and boutique hotels and las vegas the experience capital of the world but here when you think about experiences think about thomas dolby and his group playing music think about meaningful places  think about drinking wine about a journey to the clock of the long now those are all experiences think about ted itself the experience capital in the world of conferences all of these are experiences and the question isn't really so much a question as an accusation and the dutch when they usually put it it always starts with the same two words you know the words i mean we like real so much has that happened that i've developed a fairly praticed response which is  because in the beginning were i point out that first of all you have to understand that there is no such thing as an inauthentic experience why because the experience happens inside of us it's our reaction to the events that are staged in front of us so as long as we are in any sense authentic human beings then every experience we have is authentic now there may be more or less natural or artificial stimuli for the experience but even that is a matter of degree not there is a company that manufactured the car that delivered you to the edge of the woods there's a company that manufactured the shoes that you have to protect yourself from the ground of the woods there's a company that provides a cell phone service you have in case you get lost in the woods all of those are man made artificiality brought into the woods by you and by the very nature of being there  but nonetheless not just the dutch but everyone has this desire for the authentic and authenticity is therefore becoming the new consumer sensibility you can look at how each of these economies developed that each one has their own business imperative matched with a consumer sensibility we're the agrarian economy and we're supplying commodities it's about supply and availability getting the commodities to market  getting the costs down as low as possible so we can offer them to the masses  with the service economy it is about  improving quality that has the whole quality movement has risen with the service economy over the past twenty or thirty years and now with the experience economy it's about rendering authenticity rendering authenticity and the keyword is rendering right rendering because you have to get your consumers as business people to percieve your offerings as authentic there is a basic paradox no one can have an inauthentic experience but no business can supply one because all businesses are man made objects all business is involved with money all business is a matter of using machinery and all those things make something but then along came the industrial revolution  rendering authenticity at which authenticity entered the lexicon if you will  and that is to no surprise in shakespeare and in his play hamlet says something profoundly real and this above all to thine own self be true that thou canst not then be false to and those three verses are the core of authenticity there are two dimensions to authenticity one being true to yourself which is very self directed other directed being what you say you are to others  like that you think about that you do in fact get a two by two where on one dimension it's a matter of being true to yourself as businesses are the economic offerings you are providing are they true to themselves  and the other dimension is are they what they say they are to others you have is not true to itself and is not what it says it is  yielding a two by two matrix and of course if you are both true to yourself and are what you say you are then you're real real the opposite of course is  a general rule if you don't like it if you do like it it's now the other two sides of the coin are being a real fake is what it says it is but is not true to itself or being a fake real true to itself but not what it says it is you can think about those two you know both of these better than being fake fake not quite as good as being real real you can contrast them by thinking about well what then happened over the last fifty or sixty years is that goods have become commoditized right because you can see behind the facade right it is what it says it is it's universal studio it's in the city of los angeles you're going to walk a lot right you don't tend to walk a lot in los angeles well here 's a place where you are going to walk a lot outside in this city  but is it really true to itself  is it really in the city is you can see behind all of it and see what is going on in the facades of it so she calls it a real fake  disney world on the other hand is a fake real or a fake reality but it is we won 't talk about santa claus  but disney world is wonderfully true to itself right just wonderfully true to itself when you are there you are just immersed in this wonderful environment so it's a fake real now the easiest way  to fall down in this and not be real real right the easiest way not to be true to yourself is not to understand your heritage and thereby repudiate that heritage they just care about three things and three things only price price and price to understand that  think about disney again ten or fifteen years ago right the disney the company that is probably best known for family values out there disney bought the abc network the t a network then it bought miramax known for its nc seventeen fare and all of a sudden families everywhere couldn't really trust what they were getting from disney it was no longer true to its heritage no longer true to walt disney that's one of the reasons why they're having such trouble today and why roy disney is out to get michael eisner because it is no longer true to itself when it comes to being what you say you are the easiest mistake that companies make is that they advertise things that they are not now there's an antidote to commoditization and that is customization that's when you're perceived as fake as a phony company advertizing things that you're not think about any hotel any airline any hospital but unfortunately you have to experience the actual hotel airline and hospital and then you have that disconnect then you have that perception that you are phony so the number one thing to do when it comes to being what you say you are is to provide places for people to experience who you are for people to experience who you are not advertising does it that's why you have companies like starbucks my first book was called mass customization it came up a couple of times yesterday and how i discovered this progression of economic value was realizing that customizing a good  that doesn't advertise at all they said you want to know who we are you have to come experience us and think about the economic value they have provided by that experience  right coffee at its core is what  it's beans right it's coffee beans you know how much coffee is worth when treated as a commodity as two or three cents per cup that's what coffee is worth but grind it roast it package it put it on a grocery store shelf and now it'll cost five ten fifteen cents when you treat it as a good  take that same good and perform the service of actually brewing it for a customer in a corner diner in a bodega a kiosk somewhere you get fifty cents maybe a buck per cup of coffee but surround the brewing of that coffee with the ambiance of a starbucks with the authentic cedar that goes inside of there and now because of that authentic experience you can charge two three four five dollars for a cup of coffee so authenticity is becoming the new consumer sensibility let me summarize it for the business people in the audience with three rules three basic rules one don't say you're authentic it's easier to be authentic if you don't say you're authentic and three if you say you're authentic you better be authentic what we what will make us happy  satisfying the desire for authenticity thank you the past ten or twenty years what's happened is that services are being commoditized as well ,"I'm a very fundamental change that is going on in the very fabric of the modern economy and it's not about that I want to go back to the beginning because in the beginning were Commodities Commodities are things that you grow in the ground raised in the grinder for Lila ground-based Leanna middle of vegetable and then you extract them out of the ground and sell them on the Open Market Place Commodities were the basis of The Agrarian economy that lasted for Millennia but then Along Came the Industrial Revolution and then Goods became the predominant economic offering were use Commodities as a raw material to be able to make for manufactured goods removed from a great economy to an industrial economy but what then happened over the last fifty or sixty years is it good to become come out of time, the treated like a commodity where people don't care who makes them. they just care about three things and three things only price price and price. that was an antidote to come on ization and that is customization my first book was called Mass customization and it came up a couple of times yesterday and how I discovered this progression economic giant was realizing the customized good automatically turned into a service because it was done just for a particular person because it wasn't inventoried it was delivered on demand to that individual person based economy over the past ten or Twenty Years what's happened is IT services are being commoditized as well long distance telephone service sold on price price price fast-food restaurants other value pricing and even the internet is commoditized and not just good but Services as well. what that means is that it's time to move to a new level of economic value time to go beyond the goods and the services and using the same your wrist is what happens when you customize a service what happened to designer Services appropriate for particular person zactly what they needed this moment in time and you can't help but make them go while you can't help it turn into a memorable event you can't help but turned into an experience so we're shifting to and experience economy Works drain cesare becoming the predominant economic offering the most places that I talk to you when I talk about experience I talk about Disney at the world's Premier experience I talk about steam restaurants and experiential retail and boutique hotels in Las Vegas The Experience capital of the world but here when you think about experiences think about Thomas Dolby and his crew play music think about me for places think about drinking wine about a journey to the clock of the long now those are all its branches think about Ted. itself The Experience capital in the world of conferences all of these are experience has been a lot of time in Europe in particular in the Netherlands right talk about the experience economy there I'm always greeted at the end with one particular question almost invariably and the question isn't really such a question is an accusation and the watch when they usually put it it it it always starts with the same two words in other words I mean you Americans. I said you Americans you like your fantasy environments your face your Disneyland experiences we like real natural authentic experience so much does that happen is that I developed a fairly practice response which is my point out that first of all you have to understand that there is no such thing as an inauthentic experience why is experience happens inside of us it's our reaction to the events or stage in front of us so as long as we aren't any sense authentic human beings and every experience we have is authentic or maybe more or less natural or artificial stimuli for the experience but even that is a matter of degree not kind. there's no such thing as a hundred percent natural experience even if you go for a walk in the proverbial what there is a company that manufactured the car the delivery do the edge of the woods there's a company that manufactured the shoes that you have to protect yourself from the ground of the woods there's a company provides a cell phone service you have in case you get lost in the woods. all of those are man-made artificiality brought into the woods by you than by the very nature of being there. I know I always finished on off by talking about the thing that amazes me the most about this question for Chipley coming from the Dutch is it the Netherlands is every bit as manufacturer has Disneyland and I realized or otherwise move modified and manicure to look as if it had always been there so if I say we go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up in rows. but none the less not just a Dutch but everyone has this desire for the authentic inauthenticity is there for becoming the new consumer sensibility the buying criteria by which consumers are choosing who they going to buy from and what they are going to buy becoming the basis of the economy back you can look at how each of these economies develop that each one has her own business imperative match with the consumer sensibility with Hugh Grant Economist applying for them out of these it's about Supply and availability getting the Commodities to Market with industrial economy it is about controlling costs getting the cost down as low as possible so we can offer them to the masses. with the service economy it is about improving quality that has 20 or 30 years and now with the experience economy it's about rendering authenticity rendering authenticity and that's the key word is rendering. by rendering cuz you have to get your consumers as business people to perceive your offerings as authentic cuz there is a basic Paradise no one can have an inauthentic experience. but no business can supply one. because all businesses are man-made objects all businesses is involved with money all business is a matter of using machinery and all those things make something in the authentic so how do you render authenticity is the question my rendering authenticity. what do you think about that let me go back to what Lionel trilling and his seminal book and authenticity sincerity and authenticity came out in 1962 as the seminal point at which authenticity entered the Lexicon if you will and that is to No Surprise and Shakespeare and in his play Hamlet and there was one point is play Hamlet where the most fake of all the characters in Hamlet eulonia so something profoundly real at the end of a laundry list of advice is given to a son Les artist he says this. and this above all to thine own self be true. It's not then be false to any man. and those three verses are the core of authenticity there are two Dimensions to authenticity one being true to yourself which is very self-directed. 2 is other-directed be what you say you are to others and I don't know about you but never I counter two Dimensions I'm either going to. what you think about that you do in fact yet a to buy to wear on one dimension it's a matter of being true to yourself as businesses are the economic offerings you are provide are they true to themselves and the other dimension is are they what they say they are to others. if not. you have is not true itself and is not what it says it is holding a 2 by 2 Matrix and of course if you are both true to yourself and are what you say you are then your real real. the opposite of course is there always been companies around Supply to fake cuz they're always be desire for the fact that general rule if you don't like it it's fake if you do like it is full. now the other two sides of the coin are being a real fake. is what it says it is but is not true to itself or being a fake real is true to itself but not what it says it is you think about those two things are better than being fake fake good as being real real you can contrast them by thinking about Universal CityWalk versus Disney World or Disneyland Universal CityWalk is a real fact in fact we got this very term from Ava Louise Huxtable book The unreal America wonderful book where she talked about Universal CityWalk as you know she cries to fake but she says at least that's a real thing right because you can see behind the facade right it is what it says it's at Universal Studio it's in the city of Los Angeles you're going to walk a lot you don't tend to walk a lot in Los Angeles with here's a place where you are going to walk a lot outside in this city but is it really true what sound. but is it really in the city is it. and you can see behind all of it and see what is going on in the facades of it cuz she calls it a real thing Disney World on the other hand is a fake real or fake reality is not what it says it's not really the Magic Kingdom. but it is all I'm sorry I didn't mean to. we will talk about Santa Claus at Disney world is wonderfully true to itself as wonderfully true to self when you are there you are just immersed in this wonderful environment so it's a fake real. now the easiest way. two to fall down in this and not be real real by the easiest way not to be true to yourself is not to understand your heritage and thereby repudiate that Heritage are the key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business knowing where your heritage is what you have done in the past and what you have done in the past limits what you can do what you can get away with essentially in the future just understand that past. think about Disney again Disney. ten or fifteen years ago I'll write the Disney that company that is probably best known for family values out there Disney bought the ABC Network. ABC Network affectionately known in the trade as the tiene Network what's jargon is it couldn't really trust what they were getting from Disney it was no longer true to its Heritage no longer true to Walt Disney it's one of the reasons why they're having such trouble today and why Roy Disney is out to get Michael Eisner because it is no longer true to itself to understand what your past limit what you can do in the future when it comes to being what you say you are the easiest mistake the companies make that they advertise things that they are not. but that's when you're perceived as fake as a phony company advertising things that you're not think about any hotel any Airline and the hospital if you could check into the ads you have a great experience. but unfortunately you have to experience the actual Hotel Airline and hospital and then you have that disconnect and you have that perception that you are phony so that the number one thing to do when it comes to being what you say you are is to provide places for people to experience who you are for people to experience who you aren't writing that advertising doesn't that's why you have companies like Starbucks. I thought it doesn't advertise at all I said you want to know who we are you have to come Xperience us. and think about the economic value they have provided by that experience my coffee at its core is what. green beans right coffee bean coffee is worth when treated as a commodity has to be. two or three cents per cup that's what coffee is worth the grind it roasted package of put on a grocery store shelf and now it'll cost 510 $0.15 when you treated as a good. take that same good and perform the service of actually Brewing it for a customer in a corner Diner and Obey Daga kiosks and where you get you get 50 Cent maybe a buck for a cup of coffee but surround Bruno that coffee with the Ambiance of a Starbucks with the authentic Cedar that goes inside of there and now because of that authentic experience you can charge two or three for $5 for a cup of coffee. to authenticity is becoming the new consumer sensibility let me summarize it for the business people in the audience with three rules three basic rules don't say your authentic unless you really are authentic. to it's easier to be authentic if you don't say you're off at 2:00. and 3 if you say your authentic. you better be authentic. and then for the consumers for everyone else in the audience let me simply summarize it by saying increasingly what we what will make us happy. is spending our time and our money satisfying the desire for authenticity thank you",0.79296875
PhilippeStarck_2007,we give you white pages invent we give you the best tools the best tools and now do  toothpick beautiful toilet seats it that's why i continue to work even if it's for toilet brush  one we can call it the cynical design that means the design invented by raymond loewy in the fifties who said what which is terrible it means the design must be just the weapon for marketing for producer to make product  you will understand nothing with my type of english it's good for you because you can have a  that the cynical design after there is  design it's there is people like me who try to deserve to exist and who are so to make this useless job who try to do it in another way and they try i try to  make the object for the object but for the result for the profit for the human being the person who will use it if we take the toothbrush i don't think about the toothbrush i think what in what society this guy live what civilization creates this society  what animal species creates this civilization when i  anything but when i come back i can understand why i shall not do it because today to not fantastic people i must tell you i am like that not very  but to come back where i am at the animal species there is things to see there is things to see there is the big challenge the big challenge in front of us because there is not a human production which exists of what i call the big image the  mutation our life we must remember and we can see that  yes there was this soup called soupe primordiale this first soup bloop bloop  sort of dirty mud no life nothing because usually in life i think my job is absolutely useless i mean i  and that up at the end finally that succeeds and life appears we was so so stupid the most stupid bacteria even i think we copy our way to reproduce you know what i mean and something of  after we become a fish after we become a frog after we become a monkey after we become what we are today a super monkey  and the fun is the super monkey we are today is at half of the story  can you imagine from that stupid bacteria to us with a microphone with a computer with an ipod four billion years and we know and especially carolyn that  don't know what and four billion years yes she said something like that ok that means we are can you imagine it's very symbolic because the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today  and today we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years and this territory is  after carolyn and all the  that is our poetry that is our beautiful story it's our we are mutants and if we don't deeply understand if we don't integrate that we are mutants we completely miss the story every generation thinks we are the final one we have a way to look at earth like that you know i am the man we mutate during four billion years before but now because it's me we stop jacket something like that i am not sure of that  because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that there is so many things to do it's so fresh  and here is something nobody is obliged to be a genius  but everybody is obliged to participate and to participate for a mutant there is a minimum of minimum of sport we can say that the first if you want there is so many but one which is very easy to do is the duty of vision i can explain you i shall try you walk but perhaps because you walk with the eyes like that you will not see oh there is a hole and you will fall and you will die dangerous that's why perhaps you will try i can see  and they continue up up up i raise the angle of vision i don't know why i am here but you know the nightmare you can have like you are an impostor you arrive at the opera and they push you you must sing i don't know but it's still very selfish selfish egoiste yes selfish you you survive it's ok if you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go i see you oh my god you are here how are you i can i can design for you a new toothbrush new toilet brush something like that i live in society i live in community it's ok  to be in the territory of intelligence we can say from this level  more you will be important for the society the more you will rise the more you will be important for the civilization the more you will rise  to see far and high like that the more you will be important for the story of our mutation that means intelligent people are in this angle that from this to here that  einstein things like that nobody 's obliged to be a genius it's better but nobody  take care in this training to be a good mutant  trap one trap the vertical because at the vertical of us if you look like that when we don't know when your brain is not enough big when you don't understand you go ah it's god it's god that's ridiculous that's why jump  come back because after there is another trap if you look like that you look  or you look inside if you are very flexible inside yourself it's called schizophrenia and you that's why every morning now because you are a good mutant you will raise your angle of view out more of the horizontal you never forget like that like that it's very very very important what so so because i have nothing to show  what else we can say about that why do that it's because we  we look from far we see  of evolution this line of evolution is clearly positive from far this line looks very smooth like that but if you take a lens  that this line is ack ack ack ack ack like that it's made of light and shadow we can say light is civilization shadow is barbaria and it's very important to know where we are  because some cycle there is a spot in the cycle and you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle that means  to say we can imagine i don't say it was fantastic but in the eighties there was not too much  like that it was we can imagine that the civilization can become in this case people like me are acceptable we can say it 's luxurious time we have time to think we have time to about something else we can start if you want by understanding it's just to start it's not interesting but so fast so fast to shadow we fall so fast to barbaria many many many many face of barbaria because it's not the barbaria we have today it's  we think there is different type of barbaria that's why we must adapt that means  when barbaria is back forget the beautiful chairs forget the beautiful  forget design even i'm sorry to say forget art forget all that there is priority there is you must go back to politics you must go back to radicalization i'm sorry if that's not very english you must go back to fight to battle that's why today i'm so ashamed to make this job that's why to try to do it the best possible but i know that even i do it the best possible that's why i'm the best it's nothing because it's not the right time that's why i say that i say that  how i work when somebody comes to me and ask for what i am known i mean yes lemon squeezer this scenario of this civilization was about becoming powerful intelligent like this idea we have invented this concept of god we are god now we are it's almost done we have just to finish the story that is very very important and when you don't understand really what's happened you cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that you go to the future  back back back back like that and you can fall and it's very dangerous no you  because we have almost finished i'll repeat this story and the beauty of this in perhaps fifty years sixty years we can finish completely this civilization and  to our children the possibility to invent a new story a new poetry a new  people who have been born worked lived and died before us these people who have worked so much we have now bring beautiful things beautiful gifts we know so many things we can say to our children ok done that was our story that passed now you have a duty invent a new story a new poetry the only rule is we have not to have any idea about the next story

What will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth as most imaginative what's the say to these guys live what civilization created this Society. when I arrive don't take one minute when I arrive at the level of real interest in anything but when I come back I can understand why I shall not do it because today we do not do it it's muffin birthday to come back at way over to see things to see there is a big challenge to be challenged in for the first there is not a human production which existed of what I call a b g major major is out story of poetry romantic poetry is a mutation. bird and we can see that in any book of my son of 10 years old that live around. yes bunfight Supreme arrive at MetLife. and that's 16 and life appear we was so so stupid. Even I think we we we could be a way to reproduce you know what I mean on something of Chris after we be, after we become a monkey after we become what we are today is the Super Monkey we have today he's at the end of the story from the stupid bacteria to us was a microphone with a computer with a hyper.. we knew and specially Carolina and this is scheduled for folk for me than you can imagine. It's very simple teacher because is it bacterial we was at new idea of what we are today and today we have no idea of what we shall be installed and this territory is fantastic it's a poetry mutation we are meeting and we don't deeply understand if we integrate that we are we completely missed the story. because every generation since we have to find her one where we went to look at the Earth like that you know I am so mad and you know we mute the during focus on yours before but now because it's me.. I am I am the true of that. Because of mutation and things to do there is so so precious and get me some senior nobody country participated from it until there is a minimum of exercise minimum of spot we can say that if you want us there is so many but one that which is very easy to do is the duty of vision.

MarkBittman_2007P,seventy percent of the agricultural land on earth thirty percent of the earth 's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals and this amount is predicted to double in the next forty years or so and if the numbers coming in from china are anything like what they look like now it's not going to be forty years there is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do and i say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life the most common argument is that we need nutrients even though we eat on average twice as much protein as even  the industry obsessed usda recommends but listen experts who are serious about disease reduction now you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts but methane is twenty times more poisonous than co two and it's not just methane  recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week what do you think we eat per day half a a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables turn us into godless sissy liberals some of us might think that would be a good thing but even if we were all steroid filled football players the answer is no in fact there's no diet on earth that meets basic nutritional needs that won 't promote growth and many will make you much healthier than ours does we don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition and it's killing us to suggest that in the interests of personal and human health americans eat fifty percent less meat it's not enough of a cut but it's a start it would seem absurd but that's exactly what should happen and what progressive i've been writing about food more or less omnivorously one might say indiscriminately for about thirty years during that time i've eaten and recommended eating just about everything i'll never stop eating animals but i do think that for the benefit of everyone the time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly ann cooper 's right  livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation air and water pollution water shortages is not our ally here we have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone and that's the hard part but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy less meat less junk more plants it's a simple formula eat food eat real food we can continue to enjoy our food and we continue to eat well and we can eat even better we can continue the search for the ingredients we love and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals reduce not only calories but our carbon footprint we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so we have to choose that and loss of biodiversity there's more like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people but to animals like this become kind of numbing so let me just say this if you're a progressive if you're driving a prius or you're shopping green or you're looking for organic you should probably be a semi vegetarian now i'm no more anti cow than i am anti atom but it's all in the way we use these things that so called lifestyle diseases diabetes heart disease stroke some cancers are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world and that's the direct result of eating a western diet our demand for meat dairy and refined carbohydrates the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of coke a day our demand for these things not our need our want drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us and those calories are in foods that cause not prevent disease now global warming was unforeseen we didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility maybe a few lung diseases here and there but you know that's not such a big deal the current health crisis however is a little more the work of the evil empire we were told we were assured that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate the healthier but the evidence is that plants and i want to make this clear it's not the ingredients in plants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the the evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming at this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer not bad but back to animals and junk food what do they have in common one we don't need either of them for health we don't need animal products and we certainly don't need white bread or coke both have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demand we're not born craving whoppers or skittles  their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health and earth friendly diet now let 's imagine a parallel let 's pretend that our government supported an oil based economy while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy knowing all the while that the result would be pollution war and rising costs  isn't it yet they do that and they do this here it's the same deal the sad thing is when it comes to diet is that even when well intentioned feds try to do right by us they fail they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness or they are puppets of agribusiness so when the usda finally acknowledged that it was plants rather than animals that made people healthy they encouraged us via their overly simplistic food pyramid to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day along with more carbs so called low fat diets so called low carb diets these are not solutions but with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local or whether we're being nice to animals the most important issues just aren't being addressed now don't get me wrong i like animals and i don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were wrenches  but there's no way to treat animals well when you're killing ten billion of them a year that's our number ten billion if you strung all of them chickens cows pigs and lambs to the moon go there and back five times there and back now my math 's a little shaky but this is pretty good and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long but you get the idea  that's just the united states and with our hyper consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease this year 's version of this now that is only a little bit hyperbolic and why do i say it another red herring might be exemplified by the word locavore which was just named word of the year by the new oxford american dictionary seriously for those of you who don't know is someone who eats only locally grown food which is fine if you live in california but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke  the official story the food pyramid and the hip locavore vision you have two versions of how to improve our eating they both get it wrong though the first at least is populist and the second is elitist how we got to this place is the history of food in the united states and i'm going to go through that at least the last hundred years or so very quickly right now a hundred years ago guess what everyone was a locavore even new york had pig farms nearby and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion  every family had a cook usually a mom and those moms bought and prepared food it was like your romantic vision of europe  because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined there was the bomb and there's now  there was no snack food and until the twenties until clarence birdseye came along there was no frozen food there were no restaurant chains there were neighborhood restaurants run by local people but none of them would think to open another one  in the nineteen seventies doing julia child imitations can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide back in those days before even julia back in those days there was no philosophy of food you just ate you didn't claim to be anything food hardly anything contained more than one ingredient because it was an ingredient the cornflake hadn't been invented the pop tart the pringle cheez whiz none of that stuff goldfish it's hard to imagine people grew food and they ate food and again everyone ate local in new york an orange was a common christmas present because it came all the way from florida from the thirties on road systems expanded trucks took the place of railroads fresh food began to travel more oranges became common in new york the south and west became agricultural hubs and in other parts of the country suburbs took over farmland the effects of this are well known they are everywhere and the death of family farms is part of this puzzle as is and where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives but whether if we could see the earth a century from now we'd recognize it it's a holocaust of a different kind thus arrived convenience it was sold to protofeminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework now i know i for one and i'm not kidding didn't eat real spinach or broccoli till i was nineteen who needed it though meat was everywhere what could be easier more filling or healthier for your family than broiling a steak but by then cattle were already raised unnaturally rather than spending their lives eating grass for which their stomachs were designed they were forced to eat soy and corn they have trouble digesting those grains of course but that wasn't a problem for producers new drugs kept them healthy well they kept them alive healthy was another story thanks to farm subsidies the fine collaboration between agribusiness and congress soy corn and cattle became king and chicken soon joined them on the throne it was during this period that the cycle of dietary and planetary destruction began the thing we're only realizing just now someone had to eat all that stuff so we got fast food and this took care of the situation resoundingly home cooking remained the norm but its quality was down the tubes there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups because all of them could be bought at any store not that they were any good but they were there and hiding under our desks isn't going to help start with the notion that global warming is not only real but dangerous  most moms cooked like mine a piece of broiled meat a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup canned fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever minute rice for dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so i can say this now this kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself it wasn't all bad by the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either  some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile  since every scientist in the world now believes this and even president bush has seen the light or pretends to we can take this is a given  but mostly they didn't eat broccoli instead they were sold on yogurt yogurt being almost as good as broccoli  except in reality the way the industry sold yogurt was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream similarly let 's look at a granola bar you think that that might be healthy food but in fact if you look at the ingredient list it's closer in form to a snickers than it is to oatmeal  sadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma if not actually killed the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contained as many soy and corn products as could be crammed into it think of the frozen chicken the chicken is fed corn and then its meat is ground up and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder and then it's fried in corn oil all you do is nuke it what could be better and zapped horribly pathetically by the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home at the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden then hear this please after energy production livestock is the second highest contributor to atmosphere altering gases so now you've got your pizza nights you've got your microwave nights you've got your grazing nights you've got your fend for yourself nights and so on leading the way what's leading the way meat junk food cheese the very stuff that will kill you so now we clamor for organic food that's good and as evidence that things can actually change you can now find organic food in supermarkets and even in fast food outlets but organic food isn't the answer either at least not the way it's currently defined let me pose you a question can farm raised salmon be organic when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet even if the feed itself is supposedly organic and the fish themselves tightly in pens swimming in their own filth and if that salmon 's from chile and it's killed down there and then flown five thousand miles whatever dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere i don't know packed in styrofoam of course now here is where we all meet the locavores the organivores the vegetarians the vegans the and those of us who are just plain interested in good food even though we've come to this from different points we all  nearly one fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by livestock production more than transportation on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food we need to start acting and this is not only an issue of social justice as ann cooper said and of course she's completely right but it's also one of global survival  which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue the over production and over consumption of meat and junk food as i said eighteen percent of greenhouse gases are attributed to livestock production how much livestock do you need to produce this ,"I write about food I write about cooking I I take it quite seriously but I'm here to talk about something that's become very important to me in the last year to it is about food but it's not about cooking per say. we start with this picture of a beautiful cow I'm not a vegetarian the old next in line right but I still think of this. maybe this year is version of this now that is only a little bit hyperbolic and why do I say it because the only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwines there was the bomb and there's now and where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives but whether if we could see the earth a century from now we recognize it it's a holocaust of a different kind and hiding under my desk isn't going to help start with the notion that global warming is not only real but dangerous since every scientist in the world now believes this and even President Bush has seen the lighter pretends to we can take this as a given then hear this please after energy production livestock is the second highest contributor to Atmosphere all three and gases nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas is. generated by livestock production more than Transportation now you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts but methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2 and it's not just methane livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation air and water pollution water shortages and loss of biodiversity there's more like half the antibiotic in this country are not administered to people but to animals but let's like this become kind of numbing so let me just say this if your Progressive if you're driving a Prius or your shopping green or you're looking for organic you should probably be a stemi vegetarian. now I know more anti cattle than I am and I had them but it's all in the way we use these things there's another piece of the puzzle which and Cooper thoughts about beautiful yesterday and one you already know there's no question none that so-called lifestyle diseases diabetes heart disease stroke some cancers are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world and that's the direct result of eating a western diet our demands for meat Dairy and refined carbohydrates the world consumes 1 billion cans or bottles of Coke a day. our demands for these things not our knees are want drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us and those calories are in foods that cause not prevent disease. no global warming was unforeseen we didn't know the pollution did more than cause bad visibility may be a few lung diseases here and there but you know that's not such a big deal however is a little more of the work of the evil empire we were we were told we were assured that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate the healthier we'd be no overconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now if there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that plants and I want to make this clear it's not the ingredients in Plants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrot the evidence is very clear that plants promote Health this evidence is overwhelming at this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer not bad but back to animals and junk food what do they have in common 1 week. I need either of them for health we don't need animal products and we certainly don't need white bread or Coke to both have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demand we're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles. three their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more Health in Earth friendly diet now let's imagine a parallel let's pretend that our government support an oil-based economy while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy knowing all the pollution Warren Rising costs. incredible isn't it yet they do that and they do this year it's the same deal the sad thing is when it comes to diet is that even when well-intentioned feds try to do right by they fail either they're out voted by puppets of agribusiness or they are puppets of agribusiness so when the USDA finally acknowledged that it was an answer I was an animal that made people healthy they encouraged US versus there via their overly simplistic food pyramid he's five servings of fruits and vegetables a day along with more carbs what they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others and that plants and whole grain should be supplanting eating junk food but industry lobbyists would never let that happen and guess what half the people who develop the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness. do instead of substituting plants or animals or swollen appetite simply became larger and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged so-called low-fat diets so-called low-carb diet these are not Solutions but with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local or whether we're being nice to animals the most important issues just aren't being addressed that don't get me wrong I like animals and I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production and to turn them out like they were wrenches but there's no way to treat animals well when you're killing ten billion of them a year that's our number 10 billion if you strong all of them chickens cows pigs and lamb to the Moon they go there and back five times there and back not my mess little shaky but this is this is pretty good and it depends whether a big is 4 ft long or 5 ft long but you get the idea. that's just United States and with our hyper-consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease kindness might just be a bit of a red herring let's get the numbers of the animals were killing for eating down and then we'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left another red herring might be exemplified by the word Loca for which was just named word of the Year by the New Oxford American Dictionary seriously. a look aboard for those of you who don't know is someone who eats only locally grown food which is fine if you live in California for the rest of us a bit of a sad joke. between the official story the food pyramid and the head locavore Vision you have two versions of how to improve our eating. they both get it wrong though the first at least as populous as Alita how we got to this place is the history of food in the United States and I'm going to go through that at least the last hundred years or so very quickly right now a hundred years ago guess what everyone was a locavore even though you are CAD pig farms nearby and shipping food all over the place was ridiculous notion every family had a cook usually a mom and those mom's bought and prepared food it was like your romantic vision of Europe margarine didn't exist in fact when margarine was invented several States passed laws the clearing it had to be dyed pink so we don't know that it was a fake there was no snack food and until the 20th until Clarence Birdseye came along there was no frozen food there were no restaurant chains their neighborhood restaurants run by local people and none of them would think the open another one. and fancy food was entirely French as an aside those of you who remember Dan Aykroyd in 1970s doing Julia Child's imitation can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide. back in those days before even Julia back in those days there was no philosophy of food you just ate you didn't claim to be anything there was no marketing there were no National brand vitamins had not been invented there were no Health claims at least not federally sanctioned ones fats carbs protein they weren't bad or good they were food you ate hardly anything contains more than one ingredient because it was an ingredient the cornflake hadn't been invented the Pop-Tart the Pringle cheese with none of that stuff goldfish lamp. it's hard to imagine people grew food and they food and again every 18 local in New York and orange was a common Christmas present because it came all the way from Florida from the thirties on road systems expanded trucks took the place of railroads fresh food began to travel more or I just became common in New York the South and West became agricultural hubs and other parts of the country suburbs to cover Farmland the effects of its or well-known they're everywhere and the death of Family Farms is part of this puzzle as is almost everything from the demise of the real Community to the challenge of finding a good tomato even in summer. eventually California produce too much food to ship Fresh So it became critical to Market can than Frozen Foods that's arrived convenience it was sold to proto-feminist Housewives as a way to cut down on house work now I know everybody over the age of like 45 miles or watering at this point if we had a slight of Salisbury steak even more so right. but this may have cut down on housework but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well many of us. grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional Raw carrot or maybe by the salad I for one and I'm not kidding didn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was 19 who needed it to me which everywhere what could be easier more filling or healthier for your family to Boiling a steak but by then cattle were already raised on naturally rather than spending their lives eating grass for which their stomachs were designed they were forced to eat soy and corn they have trouble digesting those grains of course but that wasn't a problem for producers new drugs kept them healthy well he's a fine collaboration between a congress soy corn and cattle became king and chicken soon join them on the throne. it was during this period that the cycle of dietary and planetary destruction began the thing we're only realizing just now listen to this between 1950 and 2000 the world's population double meat consumption increased fivefold eat all that stuff so we got fast food and this took care of the situation ReSound Langley Home Cooking Remain the norm but it's quality was down the tubes there were fewer meals with home-cooked Brad's desert some soups cuz all of them could be bought at any store not that they are any good but they were there most bombs cook like mine a piece of broiled meet a quickly made salad with bottle dressing and Soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever Minute Rice. for dessert store-bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now this kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself it wasn't all bad by the seventies forward-thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended Gardens we became interested in organic food we knew where we were vegetarian we weren't all hippies either some of us reading and good restaurants in learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial perhaps because it was being produced rationally as if it were plastic food games magical or poisonous powers or both many people became fatphobic others worship broccoli as if it were Godly. I mostly they didn't eat broccoli instead they were sold on yogurt yogurt being almost as good as broccoli accepting reality of the way the industry sold yogurt what's the converted to something much more ice cream similarly with looking a granola bar you think that that might be healthy food but in fact if you look at the ingredient list it's closer inform to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal. sadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma if not actually killed. getting of the Heyday of value-added food which contained as many Saw as the corn products as could be crammed into it the frozen chicken nugget the chicken is fed corn and then it's meat is ground up and mixed with more corn products Vulcan binder and then it's fried and corn oil. all you do is nougat and step terribly pathetically by the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of food like McNuggets and Hot Pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the Bland things that people were serving at home at the same time masses that women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden so now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave nights you got your grazing nights you got your fend-for-yourself night and so on leading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese the very stuff that will kill you so now we clamor for organic food that's good and is evidence of things can actually change you can now find organic food in supermarkets and even in fast-food Outlets organic food isn't the answer either at least not the way it's currently Define. play pose you a question can farm-raised salmon be organic when it's feed has nothing to do with its natural diet even if the feed itself is supposedly organic and the fish themselves are packed tightly and pain swimming in their own filth and if that's chilly and it's killed down there and then flown 5,000 miles whatever dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere I don't know packed in styrofoam of course before landing somewhere in the United States and then being tracked a few hundred more miles this may be organic and letter but it surely not organic and spirit. now here is where we all meet the locavores the organ of words vegetarians vegans the gourmets and those of us who are just plain interested in good food even though we've come from different points we all have to act on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food we need to start acting and this is not only an issue of social justice as an Cooper set of course she's completely right but it's also one of global survival which brings me. And points directly to the core issue the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food as I said 18% of greenhouse gases are attributed to livestock production how much livestock do you need to produce this 70% of the agricultural land on Earth 30% of the earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals will eat. and this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so and if the number is coming from China or anything like what they look like now it's not going to be 40 years there is no good reason for using as much meat as we do and I say this as a man who was eating a fair share of corned beef in his life the most common argument is that we need nutrients even though we eat on average twice as much protein as even the industry of Seth USDA recommence but listen experts were serious about disease reduction recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week what do you think we did a half a pound. but don't we need me to be big and strong isn't meeting essential to health one as I had heavy and fruit and vegetables turn us into Godless 50 liberals. some of us might think that would be a good thing but no. even if we were all steroid field football players the answer is no in fact there's no diet on Earth that meets basic nutritional needs that won't promote growth and many will make you much healthier than ours does we don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition meet them to have an odd form of malnutrition and it's killing us. it suggested in the interest of personal and human health Americans eat 50% Less meat it's not enough of a cut but it's a start it would seem absurd but that's exactly what should happen and what Progressive people forward-thinking people should be doing and advocating along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants. I've been writing about food more or less I'm differently one might say indiscriminately for about 30 years. during that time I've eaten and recommended eating just about everything I'll never stop eating animals I'm sure but I do think that for the benefit of everyone the time has come to stop raising them industrial and stop eating them faultlessly and Cooper's right. USDA USDA is not our Ally here we have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone that's the hard part but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy lasts me less junk more plants the simple formula eat food eat real food. we can continue to enjoy our food and we continue to eat well and we can eat even better we can continue to search for the ingredients we love and we continue to continue to spin Yarns about our favorite meal will reduce not only calories but our carbon footprint we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so we have to choose that path thank you",0.7135416269302368
JuliaSweeney_2006, credit for it and worst of all how could i not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me so i said well mom and dad what about santa claus i mean santa claus knows if you're naughty or nice right and my dad said yeah but honey i think that's technically just between thanksgiving and christmas ten the morning of my seventh birthday i came downstairs to the kitchen where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something and i sort of presented myself to them in the doorway and they said and my mother said oh bob stop i mean save time by having to loop back to our house after he'd gone to everybody else 's there's only one  and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment this humiliation of rejection by santa who was jolly but let 's face it he was also very judgmental  so to find out that there was no santa claus at all was actually sort of a relief i left the kitchen not really in shock about santa was too late for me and not yet seven the answer was clear my brother bill he was six well i finally found bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground it was a saturday and he was all by himself just kicking a ball against the side of a wall i ran up to him and said bill said so and then i said so you're six you have a whole year to do anything you want to and god won 't notice  and he said so and i said so i didn't know it at the time but i really wasn't turning seven on september ten for my thirteenth birthday i planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and to start kindergarten was september fifteen so ready i thought about it and when i was four i was already the oldest of four children and my mother even had another child to come  a piece of cake that day i had a huge virgo poster in around the time that i started filling out physically and i was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls and frankly the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale  seemed ominous and and i was astonished to find that it was also it wasn't until years later looking back on this whole age of reason change of birthday thing that it dawned on me i  other month to do anything i wanted to before god started keeping tabs on me oh life can be so two mormon missionaries came to my door now i just live off a main thoroughfare in los angeles and my block is well it's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door so normally i just ignore the doorbell but on this day i answered and there stood two boys each about nineteen in white starched short sleeved shirts and they had little name tags that identified them as official representatives of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints and they said they had a message for me from god i said a message for me from god and they said yes now i was raised in the pacific northwest around a lot of church of latter day saints people and you know i've worked with them and even dated them but i never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission i guess i was sort of curious so i said well please come in and they looked really happy because i don't think this happens to them all that and i sat them down and i got them glasses of water i got them glasses of water don't touch my hair that's the me not to fix my hair ok this phrase age of reason before sister mary kevin had been bandying it about my second grade class at school but when she said it the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations for our first communion and our first confession  and i thought well of course i believe in god but you know i don't like that word heart because it anthropomorphizes god and i don't like the word his either because that sexualizes god but i didn't want to argue semantics with these boys so after a very long uncomfortable pause i said yes yes i do i feel very loved and they looked at each other and smiled like that was the right answer and god came to lehi and said to him put your family on a boat and i will lead you out of here and god did lead them he led them to america i said  by boat in six hundred bc and they said told me how lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced and over the course of six hundred years there were two great races of them the nephites and the  that if they all remained totally totally good each and every one of them they would win the war against the evil lamanites but apparently somebody  knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil and anyway i hadn't really paid all that much attention to that phrase age of reason i was just on the edge of my seat and they said well they became our native americans here in the i said so you believe the native americans are descended from a people who were totally evil and they said yes then they told me how this guy named joseph smith those buried gold plates right in his backyard and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into and this allowed him to translate the gold plates  from the reformed egyptian into english well at this point i just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their don't start with this story i mean even the scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start said do you believe that god speaks to us through his righteous prophets and i said no i don 't because i was sort of upset about this lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story so i said yeah yeah age of reason  but the truth was i hadn't really thought this through so i backpedaled a little and i said well what exactly do you mean by righteous and what do you mean by prophets like could the prophets be women and they said no and i said why and they said well because god gave women a gift that is so spectacular it is so the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy what is this wonderful gift god gave women i wondered maybe their greater ability to cooperate and women 's longer lifespan the fact that women tend to be much less violent than men but no it wasn't any of these gifts they said well it's her ability to bear children i said oh come on i mean so fresh faced and cute to me any more but they had more to say they said well we also believe that if you're a mormon and if you're in good standing with the church when you die you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity and i said oh that wouldn't be such a good incentive for me and they said well we also believe that when you go to heaven you get your body restored to you in its best original state like if you'd lost a leg well you get it back or if you'd gone blind you could see i said oh now i don't have a uterus because i had cancer a few years ago so does this mean that if i went to heaven i would get my old uterus back and they said sure  what if you had a nose job gave me this book of mormon and they told me to read this chapter and that chapter and they said they'd come back some day and check in on me and i think i said something like please don't hurry or maybe it was just please don 't and they ok so i initially felt really superior to these boys and smug in my more conventional faith had a baby and  that's the son of god i mean i would think that's equally ridiculous i'm just so used to that story  because i wasn't exactly sure how i felt about that question now if they'd asked me do you feel that god loves you with all his heart well that would have been much different i think i would have instantly answered yes yes i feel it all the time i feel god 's love when i'm hurt and confused and i feel consoled and cared for i take shelter in god 's love when i don't understand why tragedy hits and i feel god 's love when i look with gratitude at all the beauty i see asked me that question with the word believe in it somehow it was all different because i wasn't exactly sure if i believed what i so clearly felt ,on September 10th the morning of my seventh birthday I came downstairs to the kitchen where my mother was washing the dishes in my father was reading the paper or something and I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway and they said hey happy birthday and I said I'm 7 and my father smiled and said well you know what that means don't you and I said yeah that I can have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents and my dad said well yes but more importantly being seven means that you've reached the Age of Reason and you're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man. no I had heard this phrase Age of Reason before Sister Mary Kevin had been banding it about my second grade class is cool but when she said if the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations for a first communion our first confession everybody knew that was really all about the white dress in the white Veil and anyway I haven't really paid all that much attention to that phrase Age of Reason so I said yeah yeah it's a reason. and my dad said well we believe in the Catholic church that God knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong but when you're 7 you're old enough to know better so you grown up and reach the Age of Reason and now God will start keeping notes on you and begin your permanent record. and I said. wait a minute you mean all that time up till today all that time I was so good. Didn't notice it and my mom said while I noticed it. I thought how could I not have known this before having it on the Sun King when they've been telling me all of them. where did for it first of all how could I not have realize it's very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me so I said won't mom and dad what about Santa Claus and Santa Claus knows if you're naughty or nice right and my dad said yeah but honey I think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas and my mother said oh stop it let's just tell her I mean she's 7 too late there is no Santa Claus. actually not that upsetting to me my parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus how they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed that instead of Santa delivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve like he did for every other family you got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning our family would give Santa more time Santa will come to our house while we were at 9 high mass on Christmas morning but only if all of his kids did not make a witch made me very suspicious it was pretty obvious it was really our parents giving us a present presents I mean my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style and my mother's handwriting was so close to Staunton. by having to loop back to our house every corner of everybody else's there's only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit and my poor parents are trying to protect us from the embarrassment this humiliation of rejection by Santa who was Jolly let's face it he was also very judgmental so to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief I left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa rather I was just dumbfounded about how could I miss this whole Age of Reason thing was too late for me maybe I could help someone else someone who could use the information they had to fit your criteria they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the Age of Reason and not yet haven't answer was clear my brother Bill he was fixed well I finally found Bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground it was a Saturday and he was all by himself just kicking a ball against the side of a. I'm running to do I just realized the Age of Reason strengthen your print 7 and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against God in mad and Bill said so and it's so you're sexy with a whole year to do anything you want to and God won't notice it and he said so and I said so. I told her to run I was so angry with him but when I got to the top of the steps I turned around dramatically and said oh by the way Bill there is no Santa Claus. now I didn't know it at the time but I really wasn't turning 7 on September 10th for my 13th birthday I planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends but a couple of weeks before he and my mother took me aside and said I need to speak to you privately. September 10th is not your birthday it's October 10th and I said what and she said. listen. the cutoff date to start kindergarten with September 15th. your birthday was September 10th and then I wasn't sure that you weren't just going to go bowling I have it all over the place so I started to tell you your birthday was September 10th but Julia was so ready to start school honey you were so ready. I thought about it when I was 4 I was already the oldest of four children and my mother even had another child to come so what I think she understandably really meant was that she was so ready she was already then she said don't worry Julie every year on October 10th when it was your birthday but you didn't realize it I made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day. which was comforting but troubling my mother had been celebrating my birthday with me without me. what was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that I was going to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriend what was most upsetting was it this meant I was not a Virgo. start in my bedroom. this meant that I was a Libra. so I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster the Virgo posters a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair sort of lounging by some water but the Levi posters just a huge scale. the time that I started filling out physically and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls and frankly the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale to see ominous into Frozen. but I got the new Libre poster and I started to read my new Libra horoscope and I was just trying to find that it was also totally me. it wasn't until years later looking back on this whole Age of Reason change of birthday thing that it dawned on me I wasn't trying to. before God started keeping tabs on me oh life can be so cruel. one day to Mormon missionaries came to my door now I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles and my block is Wilton natural beginning for people who are peddling things door-to-door sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven and sometimes I get teenagers who promised me that they won't join a gang and just start robbing people if I only buy some magazine subscriptions from that so normally I just ignore the doorbell but on this day I answered and there's two two boys each about 19 and white start short sleeve shirts and they have little name tags identified them as official representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and they said they had a message for me from God I said a message for me from guys and they said yes now I was raised in the Pacific Northwest around a lot of Church of Latter Day Saints people and you know I work with them and even dated them but I never really knew the doctor in or what they said.. when they were out on a mission and I guess it was very curious so I said please come in and they look really happy because I don't think this happens to the mall that office. and I sat them down and I I got them glasses of water. okay I got it I got it I got them glasses of water don't touch my hair that's the thing. call Mom on mobile. it was myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair okay. play something down and I got them glasses of water and after a niceties they said do you believe that God loves you with all his heart and I thought. well of course I believe in God but you know I don't like that word heart because it a few more prizes God and I don't like the word he is either because that sexualize is God but I didn't want to argue semantics with these boys so after a very long uncomfortable pause I said. yes yes I do I feel very loved and they looked at each other and smile like that was the right answer and then they said you believed the real brothers and sisters on this planet and I said yes I do yes I do and I was so relieved that was a question I could answer so quickly and they said well then we have a story to tell you and they told me the story all about this guy named Lehi who lived in Jerusalem in 607 Jerusalem in 607 one was completely bad and evil every single one of them man woman child infant fetus and God came to Lehigh and said to put your family on a boat and I will lead you out of here and God did lead them he led them to America. I said America. direction to America by boat in 600 BC and they said yes. Benny told me how Lehigh and his descendants reproduced and reproducing over the course of six hundred years there were two great races of them the Nephites and lamanites and the Nephites were totally totally good each and every one of them and the lamanites were totally bad and evil every single one of them just bad to the bone then after Jesus died on the cross for our sins on his way up to heaven he stopped by America and visited the Nephites. any told them they said if they all remained totally totally good each and every one of them they would win the war against the evil Limonite but apparently somebody blew it because the lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites all the one guy this guy named Mormon who managed to survive by hiding in the woods and he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chisel on to gold-plate which has been buried near Palmyra New York. I was just on the edge of my seat. I said what happened to the lady Knights and they said well they became our Native Americans here in the US and I said so you believe the Native Americans are descended from a people who were totally evil and they said yes then they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith found those very gold plates right in his backyard and he also found this Magic Stone back there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into and this allowed him to translate the gold place from the reformed Egyptian into English. what the point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch. I wanted to say. okay don't start with this story. I mean even the scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start. telling people all about Zeno the evil Intergalactic Overlord will then they said Do you believe the God speaks to us through his righteous profits and I said no I don't because I was sort of upset about what does Lima night story in this crazy gold plate story but the truth was I haven't really thought this through so I backpedaled a little and I said well what exactly do you mean by righteous and what do you mean by prophets like could the prophets be women and they said no and I said why and I said well is because God gave women a gift that is so spectacular it is so wonderful the only gift we have left over to give men was the gift of Prophecy. what is this wonderful gift God gave women I wondered maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt. women's longer life-span the fact that women tend to be much less violent than men but no it wasn't any of these gifts they said will is her ability to Bear children I said oh come on I mean even if women trying to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15 at the time they were 45 swimming they didn't die from exhaustion it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of God and they said no. I didn't look so fresh face and cute to me anymore but they have more to say they said well we also believe that if you're Mormon and if you're in good standing with the church when you die you get to go to your go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity and I said oh. that wouldn't be such a good incentive for me and I said. hey will we also believe that when you go to heaven are you get your body restored to you and it's best original state like if you lost a leg while you get a back or or if you gone blind you could see I said oh no I don't have a uterus because I had cancer a few years ago so does this mean that if I went to heaven I would get my old uterus back and they said sure and I said. what town did Josh what if you had a nose job and you liked it. or should I get your old nose back. Google me gave me this Book of Mormon and they told me to read this chapter in that chapter and they said they'd come back someday and check in on me and I think I said something like please don't hurry or maybe it was just please don't and they were gone okay so I initially felt really Superior to these boys and smug in my more conventional faith. I thought about it the more I had to be honest with myself if someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology and Dogma for the very first time and they said we believe that God impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us and she had a baby and that's the Son of God I mean I would think that's equally ridiculous I'm just so you know that story. I couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys but the question they asked me when I first arrived really stuck in my head did I believe that God loved me with all his heart because I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about that question know if they'd asked me do you feel that God loves you with all his heart will that would have been much different I think I would have instantly answered yes yes I feel it all the time I feel God's love when I'm hurt and confused and I feel consoled and cared for I take shelter in God's love when I don't understand why tragedy hit send and I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see. because they asked me that question with the word believe in it somehow it was all different because I wasn't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt,0.8059896230697632
TomHoney_2005,how could one practice such a faith by seeking the god within by cultivating my own inwardness in silence in meditation  in my inner space in the me that remains when i gently put aside my passing emotions and ideas and preoccupations in awareness of the inner conversation and how would we live such a faith how would i live such a faith by seeking intimate connection with your inwardness the kind of relationships when deep speaks to deep if god is in all people then there is a meeting place where my relationship with you becomes a three way encounter there is an indian greeting which i'm sure some of you know namaste accompanied by a respectful bow which roughly translated means that which is of god in me greets that which of god is in you and how would one deepen such a faith by seeking the inwardness which is in all things in music and poetry in the natural world of beauty  and in the small ordinary things of life there is a deep indwelling presence that makes them extraordinary it needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting a contemplative attitude  and a generosity and openness to those whose experience is different from my when i stood up to speak to my people about god and the tsunami i had no answers to offer them no neat packages of faith  with bible references to prove them only doubts and questioning and uncertainty i had some suggestions to make possible new ways of thinking about god ways that might allow us to go on down a new and uncharted road but in the end the only thing i could say for sure was i don't know and that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all  thank you  acknowledging that god is unknown and unknowable by definition finding deep resonances with other religions and philosophies in the church of england i've been a priest in the church for twenty years for most of that time and ways of looking at life as part of what is a universal and global search for meaning been reluctant to air them for fear of creating tension and division in our church communities for fear of upsetting the simple faith of more traditional believers i have chosen not to rock the boat then on december twenty sixth last year just two months ago that underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami and two weeks later sunday morning ninth january i found myself standing in front of my congregation intelligent well meaning mostly thoughtful christian  and i needed to express on their behalf our feelings and our questions i had my own personal responses but i also have a public role and something needed to be said and this is what i said i've been struggling and grappling with questions about the nature of god who is god the essence of what he said was this the people most affected by the devastation and loss of life do not want intellectual theories about how god let this happen he wrote if some religious genius did come up with an explanation of exactly why all these deaths made sense we feel happier or safer or more confident in god if the man in the photograph that appeared in the newspapers holding the hand of his dead child was standing in front of us  now there are no words that we could say to him a verbal response would not be appropriate the only appropriate response would be a compassionate silence and some kind of practical help it isn't a time for explanation or preaching or theology it's a time for  this is true and yet here we are my church in oxford semi detached from events that happened a long way away but with our faith bruised and we want an explanation from god we demand an explanation from god and i'm very aware that when you say the word god many people will turn off immediately some have concluded that we can only believe in a god who shares our pain in some way god must feel the anguish and grief and physical pain that we feel in some way the eternal god must be able to enter into the souls of human beings and experience the torment within and if this is true it must also be that god knows the joy and exaltation of the human spirit as well we want a god who can weep with those who weep and rejoice with those who rejoice this seems to me both a deeply moving and a convincing re statement of christian belief about god hundreds of years the prevailing orthodoxy the accepted truth was that god the father the creator is unchanging and therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness now the unchanging god feels a bit cold and indifferent to me  and the devastating events of the twentieth century have forced people to question the cold unfeeling god the slaughter of millions in the trenches and in the death camps have caused people to ask is god in all this who is god in all this and the answer was god is in this with us or god doesn't deserve our allegiance anymore if god is a bystander observing but not involved then god may well exist but we don't want to know about  many jews and christians now feel like this i know and i am among them so we have a suffering god a god who is intimately connected with this world and with every living soul i very much relate to this idea of god but it isn't enough i need to ask some more questions and i hope they are questions that you will want to ask as well some of you over the last few weeks i have been struck by the number of times that words in our worship have felt a bit inappropriate a bit dodgy we have a pram service on tuesday mornings for mums and their pre school children and last week we sang with the children one of their favorite songs the wise man built his house upon the rock perhaps some of you know it a celestial controller a rulemaker a policeman in the sky who orders everything some of the words go like this the foolish man built his house upon the sand and the floods came up and the house on the sand went crash then in the same week at a funeral we sang the familiar hymn we plow the fields and scatter a very english hymn in the second verse comes the line the wind and waves obey him i don't feel we can sing that song again in church after what's happened so the first big question is about control does god have a plan for each of us is god in control does god order each moment does the wind and the waves obey him from time to time one hears christians telling the story of how god organized things for them so that everything worked out all right some difficulty overcome some illness cured some trouble averted a parking space found at a crucial time i can remember someone saying this to me and causes everything to happen he will protect his own people and answer the prayers of the faithful shining with enthusiasm at this wonderful confirmation of her faith and the goodness of god  but if god can or will do these things intervene to change the flow of events then surely he could have stopped the tsunami  do we have a local god who can do little things like parking spaces but not big things like five hundred mile per hour waves  that's just not acceptable to intelligent christians and we must acknowledge it either god is responsible for the tsunami or god is not in control so that they were still out of harm 's way when the wave struck afterwards someone said that god must have been looking after them so the next question is about partiality can we earn god 's favor by worshipping him or believing in him does god demand loyalty like any medieval tyrant a god who looks after his own so that christians are ok while everyone else perishes a cosmic us and in the worship of my church the most frequently used adjective about god is almighty and a god who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism that would be appalling and that would be the point at which i would hand in my membership such a god would be morally inferior to the highest ideals of humanity  so who is god if not the great puppet master or the tribal protector  perhaps but these ideas are all just variations on god controlling everything  the supreme commander toying with expendable units in a great campaign we are still left with a god who can do the tsunami and allow auschwitz in his great novel the brothers karamazov dostoevsky gives these words to ivan addressed to his naive and devout younger brother  but i have a problem with that i have become more and more uncomfortable with this perception of god over the years if the sufferings of children go to make up the sum of sufferings which is necessary for the purchase of truth  then i say beforehand that the entire truth is not worth such a price we cannot afford to pay so much for admission it is not god that i do not accept i merely most respectfully return him the ticket or perhaps god set the whole universe going at the beginning and then relinquished control forever so that natural processes could occur and evolution run its course this seems more acceptable but it still leaves god with the ultimate moral responsibility is god a cold unfeeling spectator or a powerless lover watching with infinite compassion things god is unable to control or change is god intimately involved in our suffering so that he feels it in his own being if we believe something like this we must let go of the puppet master completely take our leave of the almighty controller abandon traditional we must think again about god maybe god doesn't do things at all maybe god isn't an agent like all of us are agents do we really believe that god is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years by his mighty acts but what if god doesn't act what if god doesn't do things  compassionate presence underpinning and sustaining all things what if god is in things in the in the process of evolution in the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world in the collective unconscious the soul of the human race in you in  mind and body and spirit in the tsunami in the victims in the depth of things in presence and in absence in simplicity and complexity in change and development and growth how does this in ness this innerness this interiority of god work it's hard to conceive and begs more questions is god just another name for the universe with no independent existence to what extent can we ascribe personality to god in the end we have to say i don't know if we knew god would not be god of course there have been thinkers who have suggested different ways of looking at god exploring the feminine nurturing side of divinity to have faith in this god would be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements ironic that christians who claim to believe in an infinite unknowable being then tie god down in closed systems and rigid doctrines ,"I'm a Victor in the Church of England. I've been a priest in the church for 20 years. the most of that time I've been struggling and grappling with questions about the nature of God who is God. and I'm very aware that when you say the word god. many people will turn off immediately. and most people both within and outside the organized church still have a picture of a Celestial controller a roommate, a policeman in the sky who orders everything and causes everything to happen. he will protect his own people and answer the prayers of the faithful. and in the worship of my church the most frequently used adjectives about God is Almighty. but I have a problem with that. I've become more and more uncomfortable with this perception of God over the years. do we really believe that God is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting in our worship in the knowledge has ever all these years. Acosta happiness thinkers who suggested different ways of looking at God. exploring the feminine nurturing side of divinity. suggesting that God expresses himself or herself to powerlessness rather than power. acknowledging that God is unknown and unknowable by definition. finding deep resonances with other religions and philosophies and ways of looking at life as part of what is a universal and Global search for meaning. the site is well known in Liberal academic circles. but Clary like myself have been reluctant to Adam. the fear of creating tension and Division in our church communities. for fear of upsetting the simple faith of motivational believers. I've chosen not to rock the boat. then on December 26th last year and just two months ago. that underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami. and two weeks later Sunday morning 9th January I found myself standing in front of my congregation intelligent well-meaning mostly thoughtful Christian people. and I needed to express on that behalf of my feelings and our questions. I have my own personal responses. but I also have a public row. and something needed to be said. and this is what I said. shortly after the tsunami I read a newspaper article written by the Archbishop of Canterbury find final about the tragedy in southern Asia. the essence of what he said was this. the people most affected by the devastation and loss of life do not want intellectual theories. about how God let this happen. he wrote if some religious genius did come up with an explanation of exactly why all these deaths made sense. would we feel happier or safer or more confidence in God. if a man in the photograph that appeared in the newspapers holding the hand of his dead child was standing in front of us now. there are no words that we could say to him. a viable response would not be appropriate the only appropriate response would be a compassionate silence and some kind of practical help it isn't the time for explanation or preaching or theology the time for Tears. this is true. and yet here we are. my chat Schnucks fitted send me the text from events that happened a long way away. but with all face bruised and we want an explanation from God we demand an explanation from God. some have concluded that we can only believe in a God who shares our pain. in some way God must feel the anguish and grief and physical pain that we feel in some way the Eternal God must be able to enter into the souls of human beings and experience the torment Within. and if this is true it must also be that God knows the joy and exultation of the human Spirits as well. we want to go out who can weep with those who weep and rejoice with those who rejoice. it seems to me both a deeply moving and a convincing restatement of Christian belief about God. for hundreds of years the prevailing Orthodoxy they accept the truth was it God the Father the Creator is unchanging and therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness. now the unchanging God feels bit cold and indifferent to me. and the devastating events of the 20th century have forced people to question the cold unfeeling God. the slaughter of millions in the trenches and in the death camps have caused people to ask where is God in all this who is this. and the answer was God is in this with us. oh God doesn't deserve our Allegiance anymore. it got is a bystander observing but not involved then God May well exist but we don't want to know about him. many Jews and Christians not feel like this I know and I am among them. so we have a suffering God a God who is intimately connected with this world and with every living soul. I very much relate to this idea of God. but it isn't enough I need to ask some more questions and I hope that questions that you will want to ask as well some of you. over the last few weeks I've been struck by the number of times but words in our worship have felt a bit inappropriate a bit dodgy we have a prime service on Tuesday Mornings to Mom's and that preschool children and last week we signed with a children one of their favorite songs the wise man built his house upon the rock that have some of you noticed some of the words go to like this the foolish man built his house upon the sand and the floods came up and the house on the sand went crash. then in the same week as a funeral we sign the Familia hen we plow the fields and Scatter very English him and the second bus comes the line the wind and waves obey him. do they. I didn't feel we can sing that song again in church after what's happened. set the first big question is about control. does God have a plan for each of us is God in control the store Order each moments. does the wind and the waves obey him. from time to time one his Christians telling the story of how God organized things for them so that everything works out will write some difficulty overcome some illness caused some trouble ever since. a parking space found at a crucial time. I can remember someone saying this to me with her eyes shining with enthusiasm at this wonderful confirmation of her faith and the goodness of God. but if God can or will do these things intervene to change the flood events. then surely he could have stopped the tsunami. do we have a local God who can do little things like parking spaces but not big things like 500 mph waves. that's just not acceptable to intelligent Christians and we must acknowledge it as responsible this Nami or God is not in control. after the tragedy survival stories began to emerge you probably had some of them the man who surf the wave. the teenage girl who recognized the danger because she just been learning about tsunamis at school. then it was the congregation who had left the usual church building on the shore to hold a service in the Hills. the preacher delivered an extra-long sermon said that they were still out of Harm's Way when the waves drunk. afterwards someone said that God must have been looking after them. so the next question is about partiality. can we earn God's favor by worshipping him or believing in him does God demand loyalty like any medieval tyrant. a God who looks after his own so that Christians are okay while everyone else parishes. a cosmic awesome van. and a God who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism. that would be a porting. and that would be the point at which I would hand in my membership. such a God would be morally inferior to the highest ideals of humanity. so who is God if not the great puppet master or the tribal protector. perhaps God allows open its terrible things to happen so that heroism and compassion condition that's God is testing us testing a charity or perhaps it's a great Cosmic plan that allows for horrible suffering so that everything will work out okay in the end. perhaps but these ideas are all just variations on God controlling everything. Supreme Commander toying with expandable units in a great campaign. we still left with a God who can do the tsunami and allow outfits. in his great novel The Brothers karamazov. Dostoevsky gives these words to Avon address to his naive and devout younger brother alyosha. it's a sufferings of children go to make up the sum of sufferings which is necessary for the purchase of Truth. then I say beforehand that the entire truth is not worth such a price. we cannot afford to pay so much for admission. it is not God that I do not accept I nearly most respectfully return him the ticket. or perhaps God set the whole universe going at the beginning and then relinquished control forever so that natural processes could occur and Eeveelution run its course. this seems more acceptable. but it still leaves god with the ultimate moral responsibility. is God a cold unfeeling spectator or a palace lover watching with infinite compassion things God is unable to control or change. is God intimately involved in our suffering. so that he feels it in his own wedding. if we believe something like this we must let go of the Puppet Master completely take a leave of the almighty controller abandon traditional models. we must think again about God. maybe God doesn't do things at all. maybe God isn't an agent like all of us are agents. early religious thought conceived God is a sort of superhuman person doing things all over the place beating up the Egyptians drowning them in the Red Sea wasting cities getting angry at the people knew that God by his mighty acts but what if God doesn't act. what if God doesn't do things at all what if God is in things. the loving soul of the universe. an indwelling compassionate presence underpinning and sustaining all things. what is God is in things. in the infinitely complex network of relationships and connections that make up life. in the natural cycle of life and death the creation and destruction that must happen continuously. in the process of evolution in the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world. in the collective unconscious the soul of the human race. and you and me minds and body and spirit in the tsunami. in the victims in the depth of things. in present sudden absence in Simplicity and complexity and change and development and growth. how does this in this is in Earnest this interior at your God work. it's hard to conceive and begs more questions is God just another name for the universe with no independent existence at all. I don't know. to what extent can we ascribe personality to God. I don't know. in the end we have to say I don't know if we knew God would not be God. have faith in the squad would be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe and that's like believing a system of doctrinal statements ironic Christians who claim to believe in an infinite unknowable being sent I go down in closed systems and rigid doctrines. how could one practice such a face. by seeking the God within. by cultivating my own in Witness. in silence and meditation. in my in a space in The Me That Remains when I gently push aside my passing emotions and ideas and preoccupations. in a wellness of the inner conversation. and how would we live such a face. how would I live such a Faith by seeking intimate connection with your in witness the kind of relationships when the speaks to be. if God is in all people then there is a meeting place where my relationship with you becomes a three-way and counselor. there is an Indian greeting which I'm sure some of the United namaste. accompanied by a respectful bow. which roughly translated means that which is of god in me greets that which is of god in you namaste. and how would one become such a face. by seeking the in witness which is in all things in music and poetry in the natural world of beauty and then the small ordinary things of life in dwelling presents the next an extraordinary. it needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting. a contemplatively attitude. and the generosity and openness to those whose experience is different from my own. when I stood up speak to my people about God in the tsunami I have no ounces to offer them. no need two packages of face with Bible references to prove them. only doubts and questioning and uncertainty. I had some suggestions to make possible new ways of thinking about God ways that might allow us to go on down a new and Uncharted Road. but in the end the only thing I could say for sure was I don't know. and that might just be the most profoundly religious statement of all. thank you",0.6380208134651184
LesleyHazleton_2010X, phrases and snippets taken out of context in what i call the highlighter version which is the one favored by both muslim fundamentalists and anti muslim so this past spring as i was gearing up to begin writing a biography of muhammad i realized i needed to read the koran properly as properly as i could my arabic 's reduced by now to wielding a dictionary so i took four well known translations and decided to read them side by side verse by verse along with a transliteration and the original seventh century arabic now i did have an advantage my last book was about the story behind the shia sunni split and for that i'd worked closely with the earliest islamic histories so i knew the events to which the koran constantly refers its frame of reference i knew enough that is to know that i'd be a tourist in the  koran an informed one an experienced one even but still an outsider an agnostic jew reading may have heard about the koran 's idea of paradise being seventy two virgins and i promise i will come back to those virgins but in fact here in the northwest we're living very close to the real koranic idea so i read slowly  set aside three weeks for this project and that i think is what is meant by hubris because it turned out to be three months i did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters but every time i thought i was beginning to get a handle on the koran that feeling of i get it now it would slip away overnight and in the morning wondering if i wasn't lost in a strange land and yet the terrain was very familiar the koran declares that it comes to renew the message of the torah and the gospels so one third of it reprises the stories of biblical figures like abraham moses joseph mary  jesus god himself was utterly familar from his earlier manifestation as yahweh jealously insisting on no other gods the presence of camels mountains desert wells and springs took me back to the year i spent wandering the sinai desert and then there was the language the rhythmic cadence of it reminding me of evenings spent listening to bedouin elders recite hours long narrative poems entirely from memory and i began to grasp why it's said that the koran is really the koran only in arabic take the faatihah the seven verse opening chapter that is the lord 's prayer and the shema israel of islam combined it's just twenty nine words in arabic but anywhere from sixty five to seventy two in translation and yet the more you add the more seems to go missing the arabic has an incantatory almost hypnotic quality that begs to be heard rather than it wants to be chanted out loud to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue so the koran in english is a kind of shadow of itself  defined thirty six times as gardens watered by running streams since i live on a houseboat on the running stream of lake union called his version an interpretation but all is not lost in translation as the koran promises patience is rewarded and there are many surprises a degree of environmental awareness for instance and of humans as mere stewards of god 's creation  unmatched in the bible and where the bible is addressed exclusively to men using the second and third person masculine the koran includes women talking for instance of  believing men and believing women honorable men and honorable women  or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers yes it does say that but in a very specific context the anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of mecca where fighting was usually forbidden  and the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers not you must kill unbelievers in mecca but you can you are allowed to but only after a grace period is over  and only if there's no other pact in place and only if they try to stop you getting to the kaaba and you first and even then god is merciful forgiveness is supreme and so essentially better if you this makes perfect sense to me but the thing is how come it's news to most people some of these verses are definite in meaning it says and others are ambiguous the perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities the phrase god is subtle appears again and again and indeed the whole  most of us have been led to believe as in for instance that little matter of virgins and old fashioned orientalism comes into play here the word used four times is as dark eyed maidens with swelling breasts or as fair high bosomed virgins  yet all there is in the original arabic is that one word houris not a swelling breast nor a high bosom in  now this may be a way of saying pure beings like in angels or it may be like the greek kouros or kara an eternal youth but the truth is i know many well intentioned non muslims who 've begun reading the koran but given up disconcerted by its otherness and that's the point because the koran is quite clear when it says that you'll be a new creation and that you will be recreated in a form unknown to you which seems to me a far more appealing prospect number seventy two never seventy two virgins in the koran that idea only came into being three hundred years later and most islamic scholars see it as the equivalent of people with wings sitting on harps paradise is quite the opposite it's not it's plenty it's gardens watered by the historian thomas carlyle considered muhammad one of the world 's greatest heroes yet even he called the koran as toilsome reading as i ever undertook a wearisome confused jumble part of the problem i think is that we imagine that the koran can be read as we usually read a book as though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach as though god and the koran is entirely in the voice of god speaking to muhammad were just another author on the best ,you may have heard about the crimes idea of paradise being 72 virgins and I promise I will come back to those version the real coronavirus your Paradise Define 36 times as Garden Waters by running streams. since I live on a houseboat on the running stream of like you need to know this makes perfect sense to me. I know many will intentions non-muslims have begun reading the Quran but given up disconcerted by it honest. the historian Thomas Carlyle considers Muhammad one of the world's greatest heroes it even he called the Quran reading as I ever confused jumble. part of the problem I think is there be imagined that the Koran can be read as we usually read a book as a we can cuddle up with it on this rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach the God and the Coronas entirely in the voice of God speaking to Muhammad we're just another offer on the bestseller list. is the fact that so few people do actually read the Quran is precisely why it's so easy to quote that is to misquote. phrases and see if it's taken out of context and what I called the highlighter version which is the one favor by both Muslim fundamentalist and anti-muslim islamophobes so this spring as I was gearing up to begin writing a biography of Muhammad I realized I needed to read the Quran properly as properly as I could that is my Alex would use by now to wielding a dictionary so I took full well known translations and decided to read them side-by-side verse by verse along with a transliteration and the original seventh century Arabic. no I did have an advantage. my last book was about the story behind so she also needs to put in for that I'd worked closely with the earliest Islamic history famous reference. I knew enough that is to know that I'd be a tourist in the Corral on your phone but still an outsider and agnostic to reading someone else's holy book. so I read slowly. I set aside three weeks for this project and that I think is what is meant by hubris because. it turns out to be 3 months. I did resist the temptation to skip to the back with a shorter and luckily mystical chapters are but every time I thought I was beginning to get a handle on the Quran that feeling of I get it now slip away overnight and I come back in the morning wondering if I wasn't lost in a Strange Land and yet the terrain was very familiar. look around the Cavs did it comes to renew the message of the Torah and the gospel so one third of it reprises the stories of biblical figures like Abraham and Moses Joseph Mary Jesus. God himself was oddly familiar from his earlier manifestation is no other God. the presence of camels mountains-desert Wells and springs took me back to the year I spent wandering the Sinai desert. I'm done with the language the rhythmic Cadence of it reminded me of evenings spent listening to Bedouin Elders besides Oz long narrative poem entirely from memory. and I've begun to grasp why. it says that the Quran is really the Quran only in Arabic. take the van to the seven of us opening chapters it is The Lord's Prayer in the smelliest out of Islam combined it's just 29 words in Arabic but he went from 65 to 72 in Translation and get the more you add the more seems to go missing. the Arabic has an income tatary almost hypnotic quality that begs to be heard rather than red felt more than analyzed. it wants to be chanted out loud it sounded music in the air and on the tongue so the Quran in English is it kind of shadow of itself or his finishing and interpretation. but all is not Lost in Translation as the Quran promises patience is rewarded many surprises degree of environmental awareness of human male Stewart's God's creation unmatched in the Bible. and when the Bible is addressed exclusively to mention using the second and third person masculine and Honorable Men and honorable women. or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers. yes it does say that within a very specific context the anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of Mecca we're fighting was usually forbidden and the mission comes hedged about with qualifiers not you must feel unbelievably can you allowed to but. only after Grace. Is over and only if there's no other packaging Place only if they tried to stop you getting to the copper and only if they attack you for an even said God is merciful forgiveness is supreme and so essentially. better if you don't. this was perhaps the biggest surprise of flexible the Koran is at least in mines that are not fundamentally inflexible. some of these verses are definition meaning it says and others on figures. the perverse heart will seek out the ambiguities trying to create the score by pinning down meanings of the only God knows the true meaning. afraid God is faithful again and again and again versions in Palatine. old fashioned orientalism come into play here. the word used for times is praise. when does as dark-eyed maidens with spelling dress. you're older than the original are they just left one work. another spelling for Astro hybrid Simmons height. I know this may be a way of saying 20 being so I can Angels or maybe like 2 because I'm at the point. because the Quran is quite clear when it says that you would be a new creation in paradise and the dura be recreated in the form unknown to you. it seems to me a farmer painting Prospect in. and that number 72 never fears the 72 virgins in the Quran that idea and he came into being 300 years later and most prevalent of people with wings sittingonclouds instructing her.

JohnFrancis_2008,i didn a t know who i would be but i know i needed to i know i needed to change because it would be the only way that i could be here today and i know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we a ve gotten to but there a s another place for us to go and we go to the place of who we are becoming and so i want to encourage you to go to that next place to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in as comfortable as it may be because we have to do something i turned around because i didn a t recognize where my voice was coming from we have to change now as our former vice president said we have to become activists so if my voice can touch you if my actions can touch you if my being here can touch you please let it be  and i know that all of you have touched me while i a ve been here and take this out into the world because we are the environment and how we treat each other  is really how we a re going to treat the environment heard my voice in seventeen years so i turned around and i looked and i said god who 's saying what i a m thinking so i want to thank you for being here i want to end this  and then i realized it was me you know and i kind of laughed and i could see my father yeah he really is crazy well i want to take you on this journey and the journey i believe is a metaphor for all of our journeys and so even though this one is kind of unusual i want you to think about  collide beneath the golden gate and a half a million gallons of oil it disturbed me so much that i decided that i was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles and it was a big thing in my little community of point reyes station in inverness california because there was only about maybe three hundred and fifty people there in the winter a this was back in seventy one and so when i came in and i started walking around  people they just knew what was going on and people would drive up next to me and say john what are you doing and i a d say well i a m walking for the environment  and they said no you a re walking to make us look bad right you a re walking to make us feel bad and maybe there was some truth to that because i thought that if i started walking everyone would you know follow because of the oil everybody talked about the polllution and so i argued with people about that i argued and i argued do that when you were sixteen i didn a t know about the environment then they a re back in philadelphia and so i told my mother i a m happy though i a m really happy she said if you were happy son you wouldn a t have to say  mothers twenty seventh birthday i decided because i argued so much and i talk so much you see that i was going to stop speaking for just one day one day to give it a rest  and so i did i got up in the morning and i didn a t say a word and i have to tell you it was a very moving experience because for the first time i began listening  and what i heard  it kind of disturbed me because what i used to do when i thought i was listening was i would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that i could i knew what they were going to say and so i stopped listening and in my mind i just kind of raced ahead and thought of what i was going to say back while they were still finishing up  and then i would launch in well just ended communication so on this first day i actually listened and it was very sad for me because i realized that for those many years i had not been learning i was twenty seven i thought i knew everything and another day and another day until finally i promised myself for a year i would keep quiet because i started learning more and more and i needed to learn more so for a year i said i would keep quiet and then on my birthday i would reassess what i had learned and maybe i would talk again well that lasted seventeen years  played the banjo and i painted and i wrote my journal and i tried to study the environment by reading books  i decided that i was going to go to school so i did i walked up to ashland oregon where they were offering an environmental studies degree only five hundred miles i had a newspaper clipping you really want to go to school here you we have a special program for you they did and in those two years i graduated with my first degree a bachelor a s degree and my father came out he was so proud he said listen we a re really proud of you son but what are you going to do with a bachelor a s degree you don a t ride in cars you don a t talk you i hunched my shoulder i picked my backpack up again and i started walking i walked all the way up to port townsend washington where i built a wooden boat walked across washington idaho and down i had written the university of montana two years earlier and said i'd like to go to school i said i'd be there in about two years  and i was there i showed up in two years and they i tell this story because they really helped me there are two stories in montana the first story is i didn a t have any money that a s a sign i used a lot  and they said don 't worry about that the director of the program said come back tomorrow he gave me one hundred and fifty dollars and he said register for one credit you a re going to go to south america came back he said to me he said ok john now that you've registered for that one credit you can have a key to an office you can matriculate you a re matriculating so you can use the library and what we a re going to do is we a re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class they a re going to save your grade and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money they don a t do that in graduate schools i don a t think but i use that story because they really wanted to help me and i had thirteen students when i first walked into the class and i explained with a friend who could i could see they were looking for the schedule to see when they could get out they had to take that class with me two weeks later everyone was trying to get into our class and i learned in that class because i would do things like this but what i learned was that sometimes i would make a sign and they said things that i absolutely did not mean but i should have  and so what came to me is if you were a teacher and you were teaching if you weren a t learning you probably weren a t teaching very well  thank you for being here and i say thank you for being here because i hunched my shoulder i got my backpack and i went on to the university of wisconsin i spent two years there writing on oil spills no one was interested in oil spills was the only one in the united states writing on oil spills my dad came out again he said i don't know how you do this son i mean you don't ride in cars you don a t talk my sister said maybe i should leave you alone because you seem to be doing a lot better when you a re not saying anything  well i put on my backpack again i put my banjo and i walked all the way to the east coast put my foot in the atlantic ocean a it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the united states  ninety the twentieth anniversary of earth day that a s when i began to speak and that a s why i said thank you for being here because it's sort of like that tree in the forest i was silent for seventeen years and the first words that i spoke were in washington dc on the twentieth anniversary of earth day and my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak falling and if there's no one there to hear does it really make a sound and i a m thanking you and i'm thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak and that a s communication and they also taught me one of those things that came out of the silence the listening to each other really very important we need to listen to each other my journey kept going on my dad said that a s one and i still didn a t let that go i worked for the coastguard was made a u n goodwill ambassador i wrote regulations for the united states i mean i wrote oil spill regulations i mean twenty years ago if someone had said to me john do you really want to make a difference yeah i want to make a difference he said you just start walking east get out of your car and just start walking east and as i walked off a little bit and they'd say yeah and shut up my time at the coast guard was a really good time and after that i only worked one year i said that 's enough one year 's enough for me to do that i got on a sailboat and i sailed down to the caribbean and you know i forgot the most important thing which is why i started talking which i have to tell you i started talking because i had studied environment and the informal level i learned about  people and what we do and how we are how we treated each other  because if we are the environment then all we need to do is look around us and see we treat ourselves and how we treat each other and so that a s the message that i had and i said well i'm going to have to spread that message and i got in my sailboat sailed all the way through the caribbean it wasn't really my sailboat i kind of worked on that boat got to venezuela and i started walking thank you for being here my mother out in the audience there i am walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says and i started walking off possessed me  the road turned into the jungle and i got to i start saying free at last thank god almighty i a m free at last what was that about i a m saying what was that about i took me one hundred miles to figure out in my heart in had become a i was a prisoner and i needed to escape the prison that i was in was the fact that i did not drive or use motorized vehicles now how could that be because when i started it seemed very appropriate to me my decision to just i had no idea i was going to become a u n ambassador i had no idea i would have a  was out in the audience say my dad said to me that a s one and so i realized that i had a responsibility to more than just me and that i was going to have to change you know we can do it i was going to have to change and i was afraid to change because i was so used to the guy who only just walked i was so used to that person that i didn a t want to stop ,thank you for being here. and I'm I say thank you for being here because. I was silent for 17 years. and the first words that I spoke were in Washington DC on the 20th anniversary of birthday and my family and friends have gathered there to hear me speak. and I said thank you for being here my mother out in the audience yet.. Imagine if you were quiet for 17 years and your your mother without me or dancing security say that's one. I'll explain that but I turned around because I didn't recognize where my voice was coming from. I hadn't heard my voice in 17 years old I turned around my God saying what I'm thinking and then I realized it was me and I kind of laughed and I could see my father and see how he really is crazy and he take you on this journey and the journey I believe it's a metaphor for all of our Journeys in and so even though this one is a kind of unusual I want you to think about your own Germany. my journey began in 1971 when I witness stuff to oil tankers Collide beneath the Golden Gate and half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay. it Disturbed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles. that's a big thing in California. and it was a big thing in my little community of Point Raise station in Inverness California because there's only about maybe 350 people there in the winter this was back in 71 now and so when I came in the night I started walking around people they just knew what was going on and if people would drive up next to me and say John what are you doing and I said well I'm I'm walking for the environment and they said no you're walking to make us look bad right you're walking to make us feel bad and and maybe there was some truth to that because I thought that if I started walking everyone would you know follow. because of the oil everybody talked about the pollution and felt I argued with people about that I argued and I argued. I called my parents up I said I've given up riding and driving in cars my dad said why didn't you do that when you were 16 and I didn't know about the environment then they're back in Philadelphia and so I told my mother I'm happy that I'm really happy she said and if you were happy son you wouldn't have to say it. mothers are like that and so on my. my 27th birthday I decided because I argue so much and I talk so much you see. that I was going to stop speaking for just one day one day to give it a rest. until I did I got up in the morning and I didn't say a word and I have to tell you it was a very moving experience because For the First Time. I began listening in a long time. and and what I heard it kind of disturbed me because what I used to do when I thought I was listening was I would listen just enough to hear what people have to say and think that I could I knew what they were going to say until I stop listening and in my mind I just kind of raced ahead and thought of what I was going to say back while they were still finishing up. and then I would launch and walk that just ended communication. so when this first day I actually listened and it was very sad for me because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning I was 27 I thought I knew everything. I didn't. and so. I decided I better do this for another day and another day and another day until finally I I promised myself for years I would keep quiet because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more so for a year I said I would keep quiet and then on my birthday I would reassess what I had learned and maybe I would talk again will that lasted 17 years. now during that time that 17 years I've walked and I played the banjo and I painted and I rode my journaling. I tried to study environment by reading books and decided I was going to go to school. so I did I walked up to Ashland Oregon where they were offering a. an environmental studies degree. and I went into the registrar's office and. what what one I had a newspaper clipping. oh so you really want to go to school there you don't we have a special program for you they did. and in those two years I graduated with my first degree a bachelor's degree in my father came out he was so proud of that listen we're really proud of you son. but what are you going to do with a bachelor's degree you don't ride in cars you don't talk you're going to have to do those things. my hunch my shoulder I pick my backpack up again and I start walking. I walked all the way up to Port Townsend Washington where I built a wooden boat wrote it across to did Sam Idaho walk across Washington Idaho in Downtown Missoula Montana I am in the University of Montana 2 years earlier. and said I'd like to go to school there. I said I'd be there in about 2 years and I was there I showed up at two years and they tell the story because they really helped me their two stories in this month in Montana the first story is I didn't have any money that's a fine I used a lot and they said don't worry about that the director of the program to come back tomorrow gave me $150 and he said register for 11 credit you're going to go to South America are you in line. rivers and lakes the hydrological system South America. I did that it came back and said to me okay John now that you registered for that one credit you can have a key to an office you can matriculate your matriculating so you can use the library and what we're going to do is we're going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class they're going to save your grade. and when we figure out how to get through the rest of the money then you can register for that class and I'll give you the grave. they don't do that and graduate schools I don't think but I knew that story because they really wanted to help me they saw that I was really interested environment they really wanted to help me along the way and during that time I actually taught classes without speaking and I had 13 students when I first walked into the class and I explained with a friend who could interpret my sign language that I was John France as I was walking around the world I didn't talk in this is the last time this person going to be here interpreting for me all the students that around and they went. I could see they were looking for the schedule to see when they could get out. they had to take that class with me two weeks later everyone was trying to get in our class and I learned in that class cuz I would do things like this. they're all Gathering round gold what you trying to say I don't know I think it's talking about clear-cutting yeah clear-cutting no no no that's not clear-cutting you can't you can't clear cup with a clear coat I think he's talking about selective class and we were having a discussion I just backed out of that you know and I just kind of kept the fish from flying but what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign and they said things that I absolutely did not mean. but but I should have been so what what came to me is if you were a teacher and you were teaching if if you aren't learning you probably weren't teaching very well. until I went on my dad came out to see me graduate and you know I did the deal and my father said we're really proud of you son but you know what he went on he said you got to start riding and driving and start talking what you going to do with a master's degree. I think my shoulder I got my backpack and I went on to the University of Wisconsin. I spent two years there writing on oil spills no one was interested in but something happened. Exxon Valdez was the only one in the United States writing skills. my dad came out again he said I don't know how you do this son I mean you don't ride in car if you don't talk my sister said maybe I should leave you alone because you seem to be doing a lot better when you're not saying anything. well I put on my backpack again I put my dad Joe and I walk all the way to the East Coast put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean was 7 years and one day it took me to walk across the United States. and on Earth Day. 1990 the 20th anniversary birthday that's when I begin to speak and that's what I said thank you for being here because it's sort of like that tree in the forest. falling in and if there's no one there to hear does it really make a sound and I'm thanking you and I'm thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak and that's communication and they also taught me about listening. that they listen to me and it's one of those things that came out of the silence the listening to each other. really very important we need to listen to each other. well my journey kept going on my dad said that's one and I still didn't let that go I work for the Coast Guard was made of you and Goodwill Ambassador I wrote regulations for the United States I mean I wrote boil spell regulation I mean it's 20 years ago someone said to me do you really want to make a difference yeah I want to make a difference in just start walking these get out of your car and just started walking East and if I walked off a little bit. you're going to make a difference buddy. how could that be how could that be how could you doing such a simple thing like walking and not top make a difference. look up my time of the Coast Guard was a really good time and after that I only worked one year I said that's enough 1 years enough for me to do that I got on the sailboat my sail down to the Caribbean and walk through all the islands and to Venezuela. and you know I forgot them the most important thing which is why I started talkin cuz I have to tell you I started talking because I had studied environment. I thought the environment at this this level this normal level but it was this informal level in the informal level I learned about people and what we do and how we are and environment change from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other. because if we are the environment and all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other. and so that's the message that I had and I said well I'm going to have to spread that message and so I got in my sailboat sailed all the way to the Caribbean it wasn't really my sailboat I kind of worked on that boat. got the Venezuela and I started walking. this is the last part of this story because it's how I got here because I still didn't ride in motorized vehicles. I'm I was walking through El Dorado it's a a prison Town famous prison or inFAMOUS prison in Venezuela and I don't know what possessed me because this was not like me. there I am walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says. and with an M16 pointed at me and I looked at him and I said passport I don't need to show you my passport it's in the back of my pack the Frances Lima oh you and Ambassador and I'm walking around the world. and I started walking off but possessed me of this say this thing. the road turned into the jungle I didn't get shot and I got I start think free at last thank God Almighty I'm free at last. what was that about I say what was that about it took me a hundred miles to figure out that. in my heart and me I had become a prisoner I wasn't prisoner a prisoner and I needed to escape the prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive or used motorized vehicle now how could that be because when I started it seems very appropriate to me not to use motorized vehicles every birthday I ask myself about silence but I never asked myself about my decision to just use. I had no idea I was going to become a un Ambassador I had no idea I would have a Ph.D. and so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me. and I was going to have to change you know we can do it. I was going to have to change and I was afraid to change because I was so used to the guy who only just walked I was so used to that person that I didn't want to stop I didn't know who I would be if I changed but I know I needed to I know I needed to change because it would be the only way that I can be here today. and I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we got into but there's another place for us to go and we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we become and. go to the Play Store who we are becoming. and so. I want to encourage you. to go to that next place to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in as comfortable as it may be because. we have to do something now we have to change now. as our former vice-president said. we have to become activist. so if my voice can touch you if my actions can touch with my being here can touch you please let it be. and I know that all of you have touched me. well I've been here. so let's go out into the world and take this caring This Love This respect that we've shown each other. right here at Ed and take this out into the world because we are the environment and how we treat each other. is really how we're going to treat the environment. so I want to thank you for being here. and I want to end this in. five seconds of Silence. thank you,0.7291666269302368
MarkRoth_2010,so it's really incredible for me to be a part of this and i want to say that i think we're on the path of understanding metabolic flexibility in a fundamental way and that in the not too distant future an emt might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide or some related compound  these creatures are some of the most immortal life forms on our planet and they tend to spend most of their time in suspended animation to a person suffering severe injuries and that person might de animate a bit they might become a little more immortal their metabolism will fall as though you were dimming a switch on a lamp at home and then they will have the time that will buy them the time to be transported to the hospital to get the care they need and then after they get that care like the mouse like the skier like the sixty five year old woman they'll wake up a miracle we hope not or maybe we just hope to make miracles a little more common to suggest that this all sort of about little tiny creatures i want to bring it close to home in the immortal germ line of human beings that is the eggs that sit in the ovaries they actually sit there in a state of suspended animation for up to fifty years in the life of each woman  so then there's also my favorite example of suspended animation this is sea monkeys those of you with children you know about them you go to the pet store or the toy store and you can buy these things you just open the bag and you just dump them in to the plastic aquarium and in about a week or so you'll have little shrimps swimming around talk to you today about my work on suspended animation now usually when i mention suspended animation people will flash me the vulcan sign and laugh but now i'm not talking about gorking people out to fly well i wasn't so interested in the swimming i was interested in what was going on in the bag the bag on the toy store shelf where those shrimp sat in suspended animation indefinitely so these ideas of suspended animation are not just about cells and weird little organisms occasionally human beings are briefly de animated and the stories of people who are briefly de animated that interest me the most are those having to do with the cold ten years ago there was a skier in norway that was trapped in an icy waterfall and she was there for two hours before they extracted her she was extremely cold and she had no heartbeat for all intents and purposes she was dead frozen  seven hours later still without a heartbeat they brought her back to life and she went on to be the head radiologist in the hospital that treated a couple of years later so i get really excited about these things about a couple of years later there was a thirteen month old the winter and they brought her back to life the next day she was doing so well they wanted to run tests on her she got cranky and just went home so these are miracles right these are truly miraculous things that happen doctors have a saying that in fact you're not dead until you're warm and dead and it's true back to life without any neurologic problems that's over fifty percent so what i was trying to do is think of a way that i have to tell you something very odd and that is that being exposed to low oxygen does not always kill so in this room there's twenty percent oxygen or so and if we reduce the oxygen concentration we will all be dead and in fact the animals we were working with in the lab to mars or even pandora as much fun as that might be i'm talking about the concept of using suspended animation to help people out in trauma these little garden worms nematodes they were also dead when we exposed them to low oxygen and here 's the thing that should freak you out  and that is that when we lower the oxygen concentration further by one hundred times to ten parts per million they were not dead they were in suspended animation and we could bring them back to life without any harm and this precise oxygen concentration ten parts per million that caused suspended animation is conserved we can see it in a variety of different organisms one of the creatures we see it in is a fish and we can turn its heartbeat on and off by going in and out of suspended animation like you would a light switch so  this was pretty shocking to me that we could do this and so i was wondering when we were trying to reproduce the work with the skier that we noticed that of course she had no oxygen consumption and so maybe she was in a similar state of suspended animation but of course she was also extremely cold so we wondered what would happen if we took our suspended animals and exposed them to the cold and so what we found out was that if you take animals that are animated like you and i and you make them cold that is these were the garden worms now they're dead  right it's a really good thing and so we were thinking about that about this relationship between these things and thinking about whether or not that's what happened to the skier so what do i mean when i say suspended animation it is the process by which we have from the time we are slapped on the butt until we take our last dying breath that's when we're newborn to when we're dead we cannot reduce our metabolic rate below what's called a standard or basal metabolic rate but i knew that there were examples of creatures also mammals that do reduce their metabolic rate such as ground squirrels and bears they reduce their metabolic rate in the wintertime when they hibernate so i wondered might we be able to find some agent or trigger that might induce such a state in us and so we went looking for such things and this was a period of time when we failed tremendously ken robinson is here he talked about the glories of failure well we had a lot of we tried many different chemicals and agents and we failed over and over again so one time i was at home  watching television while my wife was putting our child to bed and i was watching a television show it was a television show it was a nova show on pbs about caves in new mexico and this particular cave was  and this cave is incredibly toxic to humans the researchers had to suit up just to enter it it's filled with this toxic gas hydrogen sulfide now hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us we make it ourselves the highest concentration is in our brains  yet it was used as a chemical warfare agent in world war you appear dead but if you were brought out into room air you can be reanimated without harm if they do that quickly so i thought wow i have to get some of now  it's post nine eleven america and when you go into the research institute and you say hi i'd like to buy some concentrated compressed gas cylinders of a lethal gas i have these ideas see about wanting to suspend people it's really going to be okay so that's kind of a tough day but i said there really is  basis for thinking why you might want to do this as i said this agent is in us and in fact here 's a curious thing it binds to the very place inside of your cells where oxygen binds so here is the sort of big idea if you look out at nature a person some hydrogen sulfide and might it be able to occupy that place like in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind might we be able to use hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold and we wanted to see whether we could reproduce this skier in a mammal  now mammals are warm blooded creatures and when we get cold we shake and we shiver right we try to keep our core temperature at thirty seven degrees by actually burning more oxygen so it was interesting for us when we applied hydrogen sulfide to a mouse you find that as you tend to see suspended animation you tend to see immortality it appeared dead it's oxygen consumption rate fell by tenfold and here 's the really important point i told you hydrogen sulfide is in us it's rapidly metabolized and all you have to do after six hours of being in this state of de animation is simply put the thing out in room air and it warms up and it's none the worse for  now this was cosmic really because we had found a way to de animate a mammal it was fine now in this state of de animation it could not go out dancing but it was not dead and it was not so we started to think is this the agent that might have been present in the skier and might have she had more of it than someone else and might have been able to reduce her demand for oxygen before she got so cold that she otherwise would have died as we found out with our worm experiments so we wondered can we do anything useful with this capacity to control metabolic flexibility and the things we wondered i'm sure some of you out there are economists and you know all about supply and demand and when supply is equal to demand everything 's fine but when supply falls in this case of oxygen and demand stays high you're dead so what i just told you is we can now reduce demand we ought to lower supply to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal and with money we got from darpa we could show just that if you give mice hydrogen sulfide you can lower their demand for oxygen  well this was really cool we also found out that we could subject animals to otherwise lethal blood loss and we could save them if we gave them so these proof of concept experiments led me to say i should found a company and we should take this out to a wider playing field de animate them a bit so they're a little more immortal when they have that heart attack so these are the thought leaders in trauma medicine all over the world saying this is true so it seems that exposure to hydrogen sulfide decreases damage that you receive from being exposed to otherwise lethal low oxygen i should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide required to get this benefit are low incredibly low in fact so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim the metabolism of people much at all to see the benefit i just mentioned i want to say that we're in human trials now and so an example of an organism or two that happens to be quite immortal would be plant seeds or bacterial spores  you the phase one safety studies are over and we're doing fine we're now moved on we have to get to phase two and phase three it's going to take us a few years this has all moved very quickly and the mouse experiments of hibernating mice happened in two thousand and five the first human studies were done in two thousand and eight and we should know in a couple of years whether it works or not and this all happened really quickly because of a lot of help from a lot of people i want to mention that first of all my wife without whom this talk and my work would not be possible so thank you very much also  and also the wonderful scientists and business people at ikaria one thing those people did out there was take this technology  of hydrogen sulfide which is this start up company that's burning venture capital very quickly and they fused it with another company that sells another toxic gas that's more toxic than and this gas that is delivered in over a thousand critical care hospitals worldwide now is approved on label and saves thousands of babies a year from certain death ,"I'm going to talk to you today about my work on suspended animation now usually when I mention suspended animation people will flash me the Vulcan sign and laugh but now I'm not talking about working people out to fly to Mars or even Pandora as much fun as that maybe I'm talking about the concept of using suspended animation to help people out in trauma. so what do I mean when I say suspended animation it is the process by which animals the animate appear dead and then can wake up again without being harmed okay so here is the the sort of big idea if you look out in nature. you find that as you tend to see suspended animation you tend to see immortality. and so what I'm going to tell you about is a way. to tell a person who's in trauma find a way to Deanna make them a bit so they're a little more in Mortal when they have that heart attack an example of an organism or two that happens to be quite a mortal would be plant seeds or bacterial spores these creatures are some of the most Immortal life forms on our planet and they tend to spend most of their time in suspended animation. bacterial spores were thought or thought now by scientists to exist as individual cells that are alive but in suspended animation for as long as 250 million years to suggest that this all sort of about little tiny creatures I want to bring it close to home in the immortal germline of human beings that is the eggs that sit in the ovaries they actually sit there in a state of suspended animation for up to 50 years of the lives of each woman. so then there's also my favorite sample of suspended animation this is sea monkeys those of you with children you know about them. you go to the pet store or the toy store and you can buy these things you just open the bag and you're just dump them in to the plastic aquarium and in about a week or so you'll have a little shrimp swimming around while I wasn't so interested in the swimming I was interested in what was going on in the bag the bag and the toy store shelves that where those shrimps set in suspended animation indefinitely so. these ideas of suspended animation are not just about sales and weird little organisms occasionally human beings are briefly the animated and the stories of people who are briefly the animated and then it should be the most are those having to do with the cold 10 years ago there was a skier in Norway that was trapped in an icy waterfall and she's there for 2 hours before they extracted her she was extremely cold and she had no heartbeat for all intents and purposes she was dead Frozen 7 hours later. still without a heartbeat they brought her back to life and she went on to be the head radiologist in the hospital that treats her. a couple of years later so I can't really excited about these things about a couple of years later there was a 13 month old she was from Canada her father had gone out in the winter time he was working night shift and she followed him outside nothing but a diaper and they found her hours later Frozen lifeless and they brought her back to life. there was a 65 year old woman in Duluth Minnesota last year that was found Frozen and without a pulse in her front yard one morning in the winter and they brought her back to life the next day she was doing so well they want to run tests on her she got to crank it just went home. so these are Miracles right these are truly miraculous things that happen doctors have a saying that in fact you're not dead until you're warm and dead. and it's true it's true in the New England Journal of Medicine there was a study published that showed that was appropriate rewarming people would Suffer Without A Heart heartbeat heartbeat for 3 hours could be brought back to life without any neurologic problems that's over 50% so what I was trying to do is think of a way that we could study suspended animation to think about a way to reproduce maybe what happened to the skier but I have to tell you something very odd and that is that being exposed to low oxygen does not always kill. do in his room is 20% oxygen or so and if we reduce the oxygen concentration we will all be dead and in fact the animals we were working within the lab these little garden worms nematodes they were also dead when we expose them to the washing and here's the thing that should freak you out and that is that when we lower the oxygen concentration further by 100 * 210 parts per million they were not dead. they were in suspended animation and we could bring them back to life without any harm. and this precise oxygen concentration 10 parts per million that caused suspended animation is conserved. we can see it in a bride of different organisms one of the creatures we see it in is a fish and we can turn its heartbeat on and off by going in a suspended animation like you would a light switch. so this was pretty shocking to me. that we could do this and so I was wondering when we were trying to reproduce the work with the skier that that we were we noticed that that of course she had no oxygen consumption and so maybe she was in a similar state of suspended animation but of course she was also extremely cold so we sort of wondered what would happen if we took our suspended animals and expose them to the cold and so what we found out was that if you take animals that are animated like you and I and you make them cold that is easy for the garden warm now they're dead but if you have them in suspended animation and move them into the cold they're all alive. there's a very important thing there if you want to survive the cold you like to be suspended right it's a really good thing and so we were thinking about that about this relationship between these things and thinking about whether or not that's what happened to the skier and so we wondered might there be some agent that is in us something that we make ourselves that we might be able to regulate her own metabolic flexibility in such a way as to be able to survive when we got extremely cold and might otherwise pass away. thought it might be interesting to start a hunt for such things and so I should mention briefly hear that physiology text books that you can read about will tell you that this is the kind of thing to suggest we have from the time we are slapped on the butt until we take our last dying breath as a newborn to when we're dead we cannot reduce or metabolic rate below what's called a standard or basal metabolic rate. but I knew that there were examples of creatures also mammals that do reduce their metabolic rate such as ground squirrels and bears they reduce their metabolic rate in the winter time when they hibernate. so I wanted might be able to find some agent or trigger that might induce such a stake in US. and so we went looking for such things and this was the. Of time when we failed tremendously and Robinson is here we talked about the door is a failure we had a lot of them we tried many different chemicals and agents and we failed over and over again and it's a one time I was at home watching television on the couch while my wife was putting my child our child to bed and I was watching a television show it was a television show with a Nova show about on PBS about caves in Mexico and its circular K was let you here in this cave is incredibly toxic to humans that research has had to suit up just to enter it it's filled with this toxic gas hydrogen sulfide. the hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us we make it ourselves the highest concentration is in our brains. so yet it was used as a chemical warfare agent World War 1. is it for nearly toxic thing in fact and chemical accident hydrogen sulfide is known to if you breathe too much of it your collapse to the ground. you appear dead but if you are brought out into room are you can be Rihanna made it without harm if you do that they do that quickly so I thought wow I have to get some of this now no. now now now it's it's it's it's it's post-911 America and when you do you go into the research institute you say hi I'd like to buy some concentrated Compressed Gas cylinders of a lethal gas to spend people it's really going to be okay so tough day but you know I said you was over there really is some basis for thinking about why you might want to do this as I said this agent is in us and in fact here's a curious thing it binds to the very place inside of your sales were oxygen Pines and where your burn it and that you do this Burning to live and so we thought it like in a game of musical chairs might we be able to. give and a person some hydrogen sulfide in might have be able to occupy that place like in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind and because you can't buy the oxygen maybe you wouldn't consume it and then maybe it would reduce your demand for oxygen I mean who knows so. so you know that there's a bit about that dopamine and being a little bit we're still delusional and you might suggest that was it but so we wanted to find out might we be able to use hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold and we want to see whether we can reproduce the skier and in a mammal. no mammals are warm-blooded creatures and when we get cold we shake and we shiver right we try to keep our core temperature at 37 degrees by actually burning more oxygen so. it was interesting for us when we applied hydrogen sulfide to these to a mouse. when was also called because what happened is the core temperature of the mouse got cold it's stopped moving it appeared dead its oxygen consumption rate fell by tenfold and here's the really important point. I told you I didn't selfitis in us it's rapidly metabolize and all you have to do after 6 hours of being in this state of being amation is simply put the thing out room are and it warms up and it's none the worse for wear. now now this was Cosmic really. because we had found a way to Deanna mate a mammal. and it didn't hurt it now we found a way to reduce its oxygen consumption to Rock Bottom levels and it was fine now in this state of d'animation it would not go out dancing but it was not dead and it was not harmed so we start to think is this the agent that might have been present in the skier and my did she have had more of it then say someone else and might that have been able might have been able to reduce her demand for oxygen before she got so cold that she otherwise would have died as we found out with our warm experiments. so we wondered can we do anything useful with this capacity to control metabolic flexibility and. what are the things we would ride sure some of you out there are Economist and you know all about supply and demand and when Supply is equal to demand everything's fine but when Supply Falls in this case of oxygen and demand States height your debt. so what I just told you is we cannot reduce demand we ought to be able to lower Supply to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal. and with money we got from DARPA we could show just that if you give mice hydrogen sulfide you can lower their demand for oxygen and you can put them into oxygen concentration as low as 5000 feet above the top of Mount Everest and they can sit there for hours there's no problem. well this was really cool we also found out that we could subject animals otherwise lethal blood loss and we could save them if we gave them hydrogen sulfide. do you need proof of concept experiments let us let me see us we should take what I should found a company and we should take this out to a wider playing field. found a company called bike carrier with others help and this company the first thing it did was make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide and injectable form that we could put in and send it out to position scientists all over the world work on models of critical care medicine and the results are incredibly positive in 1 mi of heart attack animals given hydrogen sulfide showed a 70% reduction heart damage compared to those who got the standard of care that you and I were received with a heart attack here today. same is true for organ failure when you have lost a function in your GoPro Fusion of kidney of liver acute respiratory distress syndrome and damage suffered in cardiac bypass surgery. so these are the thought leaders in trauma medicine all over the world saying this is true so it seems that exposure to hydrogen sulfide decreases damage that you received from being exposed otherwise lead to low oxygen. and I should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide required to get this benefit. Arlo incredibly low in fact so low that Physicians do not will not have to lower or dim the metabolism of people much at all to see the benefit I just mentioned a wonderful thing if you think about it. They miss you want to be working people out just to save them it's really confusing so. I want to say that we're in human trials now and so. thank you got that face want safety studies are over and we're doing fine we're now moved on we have to get Phase 2 and phase three is going to take us two years with this all move very quickly and we ate the mouse experiment and hibernate mice happened in 2005 first human studies were done in 2008 and we should know in a couple years whether it works or not and this all happened really quickly because it might help a lot of people I want to mention that the first of all at my wife without him this talk and my work would not be possible so thank you very much also the brilliant scientists who work in my lab and also other than staff the Fred Hutchinson cancer research center in Seattle Washington wonderful place to work. and also that wonderful scientist a business people I care you one thing that those people did out there was take this technology of hydrogen sulfide which is a startup company that's burning Venture Capital very quickly and a used it with another company that sells another toxic gas it's more toxic than hydrogen sulfide and they give it to newborn babies who would otherwise die from a failure to be able to activate their tissues properly. and this gas that is delivered in over 1,000 critical care hospitals worldwide now is approved on label and saves thousands of babies a year from certain death. so it's really incredible for me to be a part of this and I want to say that I think we're on the path of understanding metabolic flexibility in a fundamental way and that in the not-too-distant future and EMT might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide or some related compound. to a person suffering severe injuries and that person might the anime dab it they might become a little more immortal. their metabolism will fall and they might look as though you were dimming a switch on a lamp at home. and then. they will have the time that will buy them the time to be transported to the hospital. to get the care they need. and then. after they get that care like the mouse like the skier like a 65 year old woman the wake up. a miracle we hope not or maybe we just hope to make Miracles a little more common thanks very much",0.7760416269302368
SherwinNuland_2003,a great deal it's the old concept the real greek concept of philanthropy in its original sense phil anthropy the love of humankind and the only explanation i can have for some of what you've been hearing in the last four days is that it arises in fact out of a form of love and this gives me enormous hope and hope of course is the topic that i'm supposed to be speaking about which i'd completely forgotten about until i and when i did i thought well i'd better look this word up in the dictionary so sarah and i my wife walked over to the public library which is four blocks away on pacific street you know i am so bad at tech that my daughter who is now forty one when she was five was overheard by me to say to a friend of hers if it doesn't bleed when you cut it my daddy doesn't understand we got the oed and we looked in there and there are fourteen definitions of hope none of which really hits you between the eyes as being the appropriate one and of course that makes sense because hope is an abstract phenomenon it's an abstract idea it's not a concrete word well it reminds me a little bit of surgery if there's one operation for a disease you know it works if there are fifteen operations you know that none of them work and that's the way it is with definitions of words if you have appendicitis they take your appendix out and you're cured if you've got reflux oesophagitis there are fifteen procedures and joe schmo does it one way and will blow does it another way and none of them work and that's the way it is with this word hope they all come down to the idea of an expectation of something good that is due to happen and you know what i found out the indo european root of the word hope is a stem k e u we would spell it k e u it's pronounced koy and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from but what it means in the original indo european is a change in direction going in a different way  and i find that very interesting and very provocative because what you've been hearing in the last couple of days is the sense of going in different directions directions that are specific and unique to problems there are different paradigms you've heard that word several times in the last four days and everyone 's familiar with  paradigms so when we think of hope now we have to think of looking in other directions than we have been looking there's another not definition but description of hope that has always appealed to me and it was one by vaclav havel in his perfectly spectacular book breaking the peace in which he says that hope does not consist of the expectation that things will come out exactly right but the expectation that they will make sense regardless of how they come out i can't tell you how reassured i was by the very last sentence in that glorious presentation by dean kamen a few days ago i wasn't sure i heard it right so i found him in one of the inter sessions he was talking to a very large man but i didn't care i interrupted and i said did you say this he said i think so so here 's what it is i'll repeat it the world will not be saved by the internet so the assignment i've been given may be mean anything supernatural certainly not coming from this skeptic what i mean is this ability that each of us has to be something greater than  obstacle for me but i'm certainly going to try what have i heard during these last four days this is my third visit to ted one was to tedmed and one as you've heard was a regular ted two years ago an elemental level we have all felt that spirituality at the time of childbirth some of you have felt it in laboratories some of you have felt it at the workbench we feel it at concerts i've felt it in the operating room at the bedside it is an elevation of us beyond ourselves and i think that it's going to be in time the elements of the human spirit that we've been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days and if there's anything that has permeated this room it is precisely  that i'm intrigued by a concept that was  brought to life in the early part of the nineteenth century actually in the second decade of the nineteenth century by a twenty seven year old poet that he wrote some perfectly wonderful essays too and the most well remembered essay is one called a defence of poetry now it's about five six seven eight pages long and it gets kind of deep and difficult after about the third page but somewhere on the second page he begins talking about the notion that he calls moral imagination and here 's what he says roughly translated a man generic man a man to be greatly good must imagine clearly he must see himself and the world through the eyes of another and of many others see and the world not just the world but see himself what is it that is expected of us by the billions of people who live in what laurie garrett the other day so appropriately called despair and disparity what is it that they have every right  to ask of us what is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves out of our shared humanity and out of the human spirit well you know precisely what it is a great deal of argument about whether we as the great nation that we are should be the policeman of the world the world 's constabulary but there should be virtually no argument about whether we should be the world 's healer there has certainly been no argument about that in this room in the past four days so if we are to be the world 's healer every disadvantaged person in this world including in the united states becomes our patient  it comes initially from the latin patior to endure or to suffer so you go back to the old indo european root again and what you find the indo european stem is pronounced payen we would spell it p a e n and lo and behold mirabili dictu it is the same root as the word compassion comes from p a e n so the lesson is very clear the lesson is that our patient the world and the disadvantaged of the world  an interlarding an intermixing of a sense of social responsibility in so many of the talks  that patient our compassion but beyond our compassion and far greater than compassion is our moral imagination and our identification with each individual who lives in that world not to think of them as a huge forest  but as individual trees of course in this day and age the trick is not to let each tree be obscured by that bush in washington that can get can get in the way so here we are we are should be morally committed to being the healer of the world and we have had examples over and over and over again you've just heard one in the last fifteen minutes of people who have not only had that commitment but had the charisma the brilliance and i think in this room it's easy to use the word brilliant my god the brilliance to succeed at least at the beginning of their quest and who no doubt will continue to succeed as long as more and more of us enlist ourselves in their cause now if we're talking about medicine and we're talking about healing  global responsibility in fact appealing to enlightened self interest but it goes far beyond enlightened i'd like to quote someone who hasn't been quoted it seems to me everybody in the world 's been quoted here pogo 's been quoted shakespeare 's been quoted backwards forwards inside out i would like to quote one of my own household gods i suspect he never really said this because we don't know what hippocrates really said but we do know for sure that one of the great greek physicians said the following  and it has been recorded in one of the books attributed to hippocrates and the book is called precepts and i'll read you what it is remember i have been talking about essentially philanthropy the love of humankind the individual humankind and the individual humankind that can bring that kind of love translated into action translated in some cases into enlightened self interest and here he is twenty four hundred years ago where there is love of humankind there is love of healing we have seen that here today with the sense with the sensitivity and in the last three days and with the power of the indomitable human spirit thank you very much that they're not saying well this is what we should do this is what i would like you to do it 's this is what i have done because i'm excited by it because it's a wonderful thing and it's done something for me and of course it's accomplished ,you know I am so bad at Tech that my daughter who is now 41 when she was 5 was overheard by me to say to a friend of hers if it doesn't bleed when you cut it my Daddy doesn't understand it so the assignment I've been given may be an insuperable obstacle for me but I'm certainly going to try what have I heard during these last four days this is my third visit to Ted one was a Ted mad and one is you heard was a regular Ted 2 years ago I heard what I consider an extraordinary that I've only heard a little bit in the two previous tits and what that is is an interweaving in an inter Larned intermixing of the sense of social responsibility in so many of the talks Global responsibility in fact appealing to enlightened self-interest. but it goes far beyond enlightened self-interest when most impressive things about what some perhaps ten of the speakers have been talking about is the realization that you listen to them carefully that they're not saying well this is what we should do this is what I would like you to do it's this is what I have done because I'm excited by it because it's a wonderful thing and it's done something for me and of course it's accomplished a great deal it's the old concept the real Greek concept of philanthropy in its original since Phil anthropy the love of humankind and the only explanation I can have for it some of what you've been hearing in the last 4 days is it arises in fact out of a form of love and this gives me enormous hope and hope of course is the topic that I'm supposed to be speaking about which I'd completely forgotten about until I arrive. and when I did I thought well I better look this word up in the dictionary so Sarah and I my wife walked over to the public library which is four blocks away on Pacific Street and we got the day we looked in there and there are 14 definitions of Hope none of which really hits you between the eyes as being the appropriate one and of course that makes sense because hope is an abstract phenomenon it's an abstract idea it's not a concrete word well it reminds me a little bit of surgery if there's one operation for a disease you know it were if they're 15 operations you know that none of them work and that's the way it is with definitions of words if you have appendicitis they take your appendix out you're cured if you got reflux esophagitis 15 Percy Jackson Joe Schmo does it one way and we'll blow does another way another working that's the way it is with this word hoe. they all come down to the idea of an expectation of something good that is due to happen and you know what I found out the Indo-European root of the word hope is a stem KU we would spell it k e you it's pronounced Coy and it is the same route from which the word curve comes from but what it means in the original Indo-European is a change in Direction going in a different way and I find that very interesting and very provocative what you've been hearing in the last couple of days is the sense of going in different directions directions that are specific and unique to problems there a different paradigms you've heard that word several times in the last 4 days and everybody's familiar with uni and paradigms so when we think of Hope now we have to think of looking in other directions then we have been looking there's another not deaf in. ocean but description of hope that is always appeal to me and it was won by vaclav Havel in his perfectly spectacular book breaking the peace in which he says the Hope does not consist of the expectation that things will come out exactly right but the expectation that they will make sense regardless of how they come out I can't tell you how reassured I was by the very last sentence in that glorious presentation by Dean Kaman a few days ago I wasn't sure I heard it right so I. found him in one of the intercessions he was talking to a very large man but I didn't care I interrupting I said did you say this he said I think so so here's what it is I'll repeat it the world will not be saved by the internet. wonderful do you know what the world will be saved by I'll tell you it'll be saved by the human spirit and by the human spirit I don't mean anything Define I don't mean anything Supernatural certainly not coming from this sceptic what I mean is this ability that each of us has to be something greater than herself or himself to rise out of our ordinary self and Achieve something that at the beginning we thought perhaps we were not capable of. on an elemental level we have all felt that spirituality at the time of childbirth some of you have felt it in the laboratory some of you have felt it at the workbench we feel it at concerts I felt it in the operating room at the bedside it is an elevation of us Beyond ourselves and I think that it's going to be in time. the elements of the human spirit that we've been hearing about Bit by Bit by Bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days and if there's anything that has permeated this room it is precisely that. I'm intrigued by a concept that was brought to life in the early part of the nineteenth Century actually in the second decade of the 19th century by a 27 year old poet whose name is Percy Shelley now we all think Shelly obviously is a great romantic poet that he was many of us tend to forget that he rode some perfectly wonderful essays to and the most well-remembered essay is one called a defense poetry now it's about five six seven eight pages long and it gets kind of deep and difficult after about the third page but somewhere on the second page she begins talking about the notion that he calls moral imagination. and here's what he says roughly translated. a man. generic man a man to be greatly good must imagine clearly he must see himself and the World Through The Eyes of another and of many others. see himself and the world not just the world but see himself what is it that is expected of us. by the billions of people who live in W Laurie Garrett the other day so appropriately called Despair and disparity what is it that they have every right to ask of us what is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves out of our shared humanity and out of the human spirit will you know precisely what it is there's a great deal of argument about whether we as the great nation that we are should be the policeman of the world the world's constabulary. but there should be virtually no argument about whether we should be the world's healer there has certainly been no argument about that in this room in the past 4 days. so if we are to be the world's healer every disadvantage person in this world including in the United States becomes our patient every disadvantage nation and perhaps our own Nation becomes our patient so it's fun to think about the etymology of the word patient. it comes initially from the Latin Pothier. to endure or to suffer so you go back to the old Indo-European route again and what do you find the Indo-European stem is pronounced paying we would spell it P a e n and lo and behold mirabile dictu it is the same root as the word compassion comes from pae so the lesson is that our patient the world and the disadvantage of the world. that patient deserves our compassion but beyond our compassion and far greater than compassion is our moral imagination in our identification with each individual who lives in that world not to think of them as a huge Forest but as individual trees of course in this day and age the trick is not to let each tree be obscured by that bush and Washington that can get can get in the way. so here we are we are should be. Marley committed to being the Healer of the world. and we have had examples over and over and over again you just heard one in the last 15 minutes. but people who have not only had that commitment but have the Charisma the Brilliance and I think in this room it's easy to use the word brilliant my God. the Brilliance to succeed at least at the beginning of their Quest and who no doubt will continue to succeed as long as more and more of us enlist ourselves in their car. now. if we're talking about medicine. and we're talking about healing. I'd like to quote someone who hasn't been quoted or seems to me everybody in the world has been quoted here pogos been quoted Shakespeare has been quoted backwards forwards inside out I would like to quote one of my own household Gods by a suspect he never really said this because means we don't know what Epocrates really said but we do know for sure that one of the great Greek Physicians said the following and it has been recorded in one of the books attributed to Hippocrates and the book is called precepts and I'll read you what it is. remember I have been talkin about essentially philanthropy the love of humankind the individual humankind and the individual human kind that can bring that kind of love translated into action translated in some cases into enlightened self-interest and here he is 2400 years ago. where there is love of humankind there is love of healing. we have seen that here today with the sense with the sensitivity and in the last 3 days and with a power of the indomitable human spirit thank you very much,0.8138021230697632
KamalMeattle_2009U,the third plant is money plant and this is again a very common plant preferably grows in hyrdoponics and this particular plant at all and you would not need any we have tried these plants at our own building in delhi which is a fifty thousand square feet twenty year old building some seventeen years ago i became allergic to delhi 's air my doctors told me that my lung capacity had gone down to seventy percent and it was killing me the government of india has discovered or published a study to show that this is the healthiest building in new delhi and the study showed that there is to other buildings there is a reduced incidence of eye irritation by fifty two percent respiratory systems by thirty four percent and also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings by an outstanding fifteen percent because you need less fresh air now replicating this in a one seventy five million square feet building which will have sixty thousand indoor plants why is this important it is also important for the environment because the world 's energy requirements are expected to grow by thirty percent in the next decade forty percent of the world 's energy is taken up by buildings currently and sixty percent of the world 's population will be living in buildings  in cities with a population of over one million in the next fifteen years and there is a growing preference for living and working in air conditioned places be the change you want to see in the world said mahatma gandhi and thank you for listening  with the help of iit teri and learnings from nasa we discovered that there are three basic green plants common green plants with which we can grow all the fresh air we need indoors to keep us healthy we've also found that you can reduce the fresh air requirements into the building while maintaining industry indoor air quality standards money plant the botanical names are in front is a plant which removes co two and converts it into oxygen we need four shoulder high plants and in terms of plant care we need to wipe the leaves every day in delhi and perhaps once a week in cleaner air cities which is again a common plant and we call it a bedroom plant because it converts co two into oyxgen at night and we need six to eight waist high plants per person ,"from 17 years ago I became allergic to Delisa my doctors told me that my lung capacity had gone down to 70% and it was killing me. with the help of fire T30 and learning from NASA we discovered that there are three basic green plants, and green plants with which we can grow all the fish every need indoors to keep us healthy we've also found that you can reduce the pressure requirements into the building while maintaining industry in the air quality standards. the three plants are areca palm and money plant the Botanical names are in front of you. areca Palm is a plant which removes CO2 and converted into oxygen we need for shoulder-high plants per person and in terms of plant giving it to wipe believes every day in Delhi and perhaps once a week and Tina are cities we have to grow them and very many or switch or steroid or Hydroponics and take them Outdoors every 3 to 4 months the second plant is mother-in-law's tongue which is a very common plant and we call it a bedroom plant because it convert CO2 into oxygen at night and we need six to eight waist-high plants per person. the hood plant is money plant and this is a game of very common plant preferably grows in Hydroponics and this particular plant removes formaldehyde and other volatile chemicals industry plants you can grow all the furniture you need in fact you could be in a bottle with a cap on top and you would not die at all and you would not need any fresh air. Bill tried these plants at our own building in Delhi which is a 50,000 square feet 20 year old building and it has close to 1,200 such plans for $300 a Studies have found that there is a 42% probability of one's blood oxygen going up by 1% the one stays indoors in this building for 10 hours the government of India has discovered our published a study to show that this is the healthiest building in New Delhi and the study showed that there is a compared to other buildings that is a reduced incidence of irritation by 52%. Teresa songs by 34% by 24% longer a man by 12% and Asthma by 9% and this study has been published on September 8th 2008 and it's available on the government of India website. add experience points to a amazing increase in human productivity by over 20% by using these plants and also a reduction in energy requirements and buildings by an outstanding 15% because you'll need less pressure. you're not replicating this in a 1.75 million square feet building which will have 60,000 indoor plants. why is this important which is also important for the environment because the world's energy requirements are expected to grow by 30% in the next decade 40% of the world's energy is taken up by buildings currently and 60% of the world's population will be living in buildings in cities with population of over 1 million in the next 15 years and there's a growing preference for living and working an air-conditioned place. be the change you want to see in the world that Mark magandi and thank you for listening",0.6731770634651184
TonyPorter_2010W,when they were about five and six four and five jay could come to me come to me crying it didn't matter what she was crying about she could get on my knee she could snot my sleeve up just cry cry it out daddy 's got you that's all that's important kendall on the other hand and like i said he 's only fifteen months older than her he came to me crying by the time he got to me i was already saying things like why tell me what's wrong i can't understand you why are you crying and out of my own frustration of my role and responsibility of building new york city between harlem and the bronx growing up as a boy we were taught that men had to be tough had to be strong had to be courageous dominating no  wrong with me what am i doing why would i my brother henry he died tragically when we were teenagers we lived in new york city as i said we lived in the bronx at the time city and as we were preparing to come back from the  the cars stopped at the bathroom my father and i stayed in and no sooner than the women got out  me but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city and it was better me  than to allow himself to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women and this is a man who ten minutes ago had just put his teenage son  something i just can't even imagine the  that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me in front of me and at the same time he was also giving me props lifting me up pain no emotions with the exception of i come to also look at this as this fear that we paralyzed holding us hostage to this man box i can remember speaking to a twelve year old boy a football player and i asked him i said how would you feel all the players your coach told you you were playing like say something like i'd be sad i'd be mad i'd be angry or something like that no the boy said to me the boy said to me anger and definitely no fear that men are in charge which means women are not  it would destroy me  and i said to myself if it would destroy him to be called a girl what are we then teaching him  about girls it took me back to a time when i was about twelve years old in tenement buildings in the inner city at this time we're living in the bronx and in the building next to where i lived there was a and he did spend a lot of time up to no good he was a troubled kid his mother had died from a heroin overdose he was being raised by his grandmother his father wasn't on the set his grandmother had two jobs  home he was having sex  we all looked up to and you should just follow and do what we say that men are superior women are inferior that men are strong women so one day i'm out in front of the house doing something just playing around doing something i don't know what he looks out his window he calls me upstairs he said hey anthony they called my anthony growing up as a kid  johnny call you go so i run right as he opens the door he says to me do you want some now i immediately knew what he meant because for me growing up at that time and our relationship with this man box do you or drugs  and we weren't doing  in jeopardy i never had sex we don't talk about that as men you only tell your dearest closest friend sworn to secrecy for life the first time you had sex for everybody else we go around like we've been having sex especially sexual objects anyway i couldn't tell him any of that so like my mother would say make a long story short i just simply said to johnny yes he told me to go in his room i go in his room is a girl from the neighborhood named sheila she's sixteen years old she's  what i know today to be mentally ill higher functioning at times than others we had a whole choice 's worth of inappropriate names just gotten through having sex with her well actually he raped her but he would say he had sex with her because while sheila never said no she also never said yes so he was offering me the opportunity to do the same so when i go in the room i close the door folks i'm petrified that women i stand with my back to the door so johnny can't bust in the room and see that i'm not doing anything and i stand there long enough that i could have actually done something so now i'm no longer trying to figure out what i'm going to do i'm trying to figure out how i'm going to get out of this room so in my twelve years i zip my pants down i walk out into the room and lo and behold to me while i was in room with sheila johnny was back at the window calling guys so now there's a living room full of guys it was like the waiting room in the doctor 's office and they asked me how was  and i say to them it was good and i zip my pants up in front of them and i  men and objects particularly sexual objects now i say this all with remorse and i was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time but i was conflicted because while i was feeling remorse i was excited because i didn't get caught but i knew i felt bad about what was happening  this fear getting outside the man box totally enveloped me it was way more important to me about me and my man box than about sheila and what was happening to her see collectively we as men are taught to have less value in women to view them as property and the objects of men we see that as an equation that equals violence against women we as men good men the we operate on the foundation of this whole collective socialization we kind of see ourselves separate but we're very much a part of it you see we have to come to understand that less value property and objectification is the foundation and the violence can't happen without it so we're very much a part of the solution as well as the problem later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men the center for disease control says that men 's violence against women is at epidemic proportions is the number one health concern for women in this country and abroad  so quickly i'd like to just say  this is the love of my life my the world i envision for her  how do i want men to be acting and behaving i need you on board i need you with me i need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our teach them to be men that it's okay to not be dominating that it's okay to have feelings and emotions is tied to your liberation as a the man box being a man but at the same time really need to begin to challenge look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing redefining what we come to know ,drive to update New York City between Harlem and the Bronx growing up as a boy who was taught that men have to be tough had to be strong had to be courageous dominating no pain no emotions with the exception of anger and definitely no fear the men in charge which means women and I that men leave and you just follow and just do what we say that Minister. Women are inferior the men of strong women a week. that women are blessed value. property of men in objects particularly sexual objects I've later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men. better known as the man box this man box hasn't it all the ingredients of how we Define what it means to be a man and I also want to say without a doubt there are some wonderful wonderful absolutely wonderful thing about being a man but the same time. there's some stuff that's just straight-up twisted and we really need to begin to challenge look at it and I'm really getting the process a deconstructing reader finding what we come to know as manhood. this is my two at-home kennel and Jade there are 11 and 12 Kendall's 15 months older than Jay there's a. Of time you know what my wife name is Tammy and I are we just got real busy and with B B bam boom genuine Jade about five and six four and five your way to come to me it didn't matter come to me crying you know it didn't matter what she was crying about it you can get on my knees she can snot my sleeve up just cried Cried Out Daddy got you at all that's important now Kendall on the other hand like I said he's only 15 months old and her he came to me crying it's like soon as I wouldn't hear him crying a clock would go off you know I would give the boy probably about 30 seconds which means by the time he got to me I was already saying things like why you crying hold your head up look at me explain to me what's wrong tell me what's wrong I can't understand you why you crying. and I have my own frustration of my role and responsibilities of building him up as a man to the fit into these guidelines in these structures that are defining this man box I would find myself saying things like this going your room. just go on going in your room sitting down get yourself together. and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like what. like a man and he's 5 years old you know what and I grow in life but I would say to myself my God what's wrong with me what what what am I doing you know what why would I do this and I think back I think back. to my father there was a time of my life we had a very trouble experience in our family. my brother Henry he died tragically when we was teenagers we live in New York City if I said we lived in the Bronx at the time and the burial was place called Long Island but it was 2 hours outside of the city. and as we were preparing to come back from the burial you know that the car is stopped at the bathroom you don't let folks take care of himself before the long ride back to the city and the limousine empties out my mother my sister and my auntie they all get out that my father and I stayed in a limousine and no sooner than the women got out he burst out crying. you don't want to cry in front of me but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city and with better me than allow himself to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women and end this is a man 10 minutes ago I just put his teenage son in the ground something I just can't even I just can't even imagine. the thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me. for crying in front of me and at the same time he was also giving me props Lifting me up for not trying you know I come to also look at this as this this fear that we have the men this fear to just have a paralyzed holding us Hostage to this man box. I can remember speaking to a 12 year old boy of football player and I asked him I said how would you feel if in front of all the players your coach told you you were playing like a girl nice Victor Newman say something like I'll be sad I'll be mad I be angry or something like that know the boys said to me the boy said to me it would destroy me and I said to myself. if it would destroy him to be called a girl what are we then teaching him. about girls. it took me back to the time when I was about twelve years old I grew up in tenements buildings you know in the inner city and at this time we're living in the Bronx and in the building next to where I live there was a guy named Johnny he's about 16 years old we will all about 12 years old younger guy and he was hanging out with all this young the guy and this guy he was up to a lot of no-good he was a kind of kid with parents we have to do 12 year old boys and he did spend a lot of time up to no good he's a troubled kid you know his mother had died from a heroin overdose is being raised by his grandmother his father wasn't on the said his grandmother had two jobs he was home alone a lot. but I got to tell you what young guys we looked up to this dude man he was cool he was fine after the sister said he was fine right he was having sex if we all looked up to him in front of the house doing something just playing around doing something I don't know what he looks out his window he calls me upstairs he said they have they call me Anthony growing up as a kid and they come on upstairs Johnny call Hugo so I run right upstairs. as he opened the door he says to me do you want some now I meet Lee knew what he meant because For Me growing up at that time and our relationship with this man box do you want some of that money to things sex or drugs and we weren't doing drugs now my box my car my man box card was immediately in Japanese. you think I never had sex we don't talk about that as men you only tell your dearest closest friends want to secrecy for like the first time you had sex but everybody else we go around that we've been having sex since they know.. The only thing I couldn't tell him is that I didn't want in it you know that's even worse were supposed to always be on the prowl women are objects especially sexual objects so anyway I couldn't tell any of that it's like my mother say to make a long story short I just simply said the Johnny yes he told me go in his room I go in his room on his bed is a girl from the neighborhood name Shield she's 16 years old she's new. she's what I know today to be mentally ill high-functioning at times and others we had a whole Choice worth you know inappropriate names for her. anyway Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her will he actually raped her but he was saying he has sex with her because all she learned never said no she also never said yes but he was offered me the opportunity to do the same so when I go in the room I close the door folks I'm petrified my stand with my back to the door so Johnny came busting the room and see that I'm not doing anything and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something so now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room who am I 12 years of wisdom my pants down I walk out into the living room and lo and behold to me while I was in the. room with chili Johnny was back at the window calling guys up so now it's a living room full of guys like you don't look like the waiting room in the doctor's office and they asked me how was it and I stated that it was good. and I zip my pants up in front of them and I head for the door now I see the song with remorse and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time but I was conflicting the why I was feeling remorse I was excited cuz I didn't get caught but I knew I felt bad about what was happening this feel getting outside the man box told the envelope and block me I was way more important to me about me and my man box card did about Sheila and what was happening to her. to collectively we is mandatory to have less value in women if you miss property in the objects of men we see that as an equation that equals violence against women. we as men good men the large majority of men we operate on the foundation is this whole Collective socialization we kind of see ourselves separate but we're very much a part of it you see we have to come to understand that less value probably not the expectation is the foundation in the violence can happen without it so we're very much a part of the solution as well as the problem the Centers for Disease Control says that men's violence against women is at epidemic proportion is the number one Health concern for women in this country and abroad so quickly I like to just say you know this is my love of my life my daughter Jay the world I envisioned for her how do I want men to be acting and behaving I need you on board I need you with me I need you to work with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men that is okay to not be dominating that is okay to have feelings and emotions that is okay to promote equality that is okay. friends in that state that it's okay to be hold that my Liberation as a man is tied to your Liberation as a woman I remember asking to a nine-year-old boy I have to nine year old boy. would like be like for you if you don't have to hear this man by he said to me I would be free thank you for. 25% of the world's food supply is lost spoilage 458 billion dollars worth every year. so we can know how far to travel monitor temperature all the way to the market we make it safer that's what I'm working on planet,0.7630208730697632
VanJones_2010X,also suffer at the point of use those of us who earn a certain income level we have something called choice so you can have choices economic choices we actually get a chance to choose not to use products that have dangerous poisonous plastic in them  other people who are poor don't have those choices so low income people often are the ones who are buying the products that have those dangerous chemicals in them that their children are using those are the people who wind up ingesting a disproportionate amount of this poisonous plastic and using it and people say well they a different product well the problem with being poor is you don't have those choices you often have to buy the cheapest products the cheapest products are often the most dangerous once again it's poor people who bear the burden often we think we're doing a good thing you're in your office put it in the blue bin you think i put mine in the blue bin and then you look at your colleague and say why you cretin you put yours in the white bin and we use that as a moral tickle we feel so good about i am honored to be here and i'm honored to talk about this topic which i think is of grave importance we've been talking a lot about the horrific impacts of plastic on the planet so we kind of have this kind of moral feel good moment but if we were to be able to follow that little bottle on its journey we would be shocked to discover that all too often that bottle is going to be put on a boat little bottle say oh little bottle we're so happy to see you little bottle you 've served so well but that's not actually what  that bottle winds up getting burned recycling of plastic in many developing countries and so poor people who are making these products in petrochemical centers like cancer alley poor people who are consuming these products disproportionately and then poor people who even at the tail end of the recycling are having their lives shortened  are all being harmed greatly by this addiction that we have to disposability now you think to yourself because i know how you are you say that sure is terrible for those poor people  and on other species but plastic hurts people too especially poor people here we are in los angeles we worked very hard to get the smog reduction happening here in los angeles but guess what because they're doing so much dirty production in asia now because the environmental laws don't protect the people in asia  almost all of the clean air gains and the toxic air gains that we've achieved here in california have been wiped out by dirty air coming over from asia so we all are being hit we all are being impacted it's just the poor people get hit first and worst but the dirty production the burning of toxins the lack of environmental standards in asia is actually creating so much dirty the root of this problem in my view is the idea of disposability itself you see if you understand the link between what we're doing to poison and pollute the planet and what we're doing to poor people you arrive at a very troubling but also very helpful insight and both in the production of plastic the use of plastic and the disposal of plastic the people who have bull 's eye on their foreheads are poor people people got very upset in order to trash the planet you have to trash people but if you create a world where you don't trash people you can't trash the planet so now we are at a moment where the coming together of social justice as an idea and ecology as an idea  we finally can now see that they are really at the end of the day one idea and it's the idea that we don't have disposable anything we don't have disposable all begin to come back to that basic understanding new opportunities for action begin to emerge biomimicry which is something that is an emerging science winds up being a very important social justice idea people who are just learning about this stuff biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species but if we want to make something hard we come up i know i'm going to make a hard substance i know i'm going to get vacuums and furnaces and drag stuff out of the ground and get things hot when the bp oil spill happened for very good reason people thought about oh my god this is terrible this oil it's in the water it's going to destroy that's called biomimicry and that opens the door to zero waste production zero pollution production  actually enjoy a high quality of life a high standard of living without trashing the planet well that idea of biomimicry respecting the wisdom of all species combined with the idea of democracy and social justice respecting the wisdom and the worth of all people give us a different society we would have a different economy we would have a green society that doctor king would be proud of that should be the goal  and the way that we get there is to first of all recognize that the idea of disposability not only hurts the species we've talked about but it even corrupts our own society we're so proud to live here in california we just had this vote and everybody 's like well not in our state know what those other states were doing just so proud and  proud too but california though we lead the world in some of the green stuff we also unfortunately lead the world in some of the gulag stuff  the living systems there people are going to be hurt this is a terrible thing that the oil is going to hurt the people in the gulf  states so that is consistent with this idea that disposability is something we believe in and yet as a movement that has to broaden its constituency that has to grow that has to reach out beyond our natural comfort zone one of the challenges to the success of this movement of getting rid of things like plastic and helping the economy shift is people look at our movement with some suspicion and they ask a question and the question is how can these people be so passionate poor person a low income person somebody in cancer alley somebody in watts somebody in harlem somebody on an indian reservation might say to themselves and rightfully so how can these people be so passionate about making sure that a plastic bottle has a second chance in life or an aluminum can has a second chance and yet when my child gets in trouble and goes to prison what people don't think about is what if the oil had made it safely to shore what if the oil actually got where it was trying to go  and so we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movement when we take on topics like this it gives us that extra call to reach out to other movements and to become more inclusive and to grow and we can finally get out of this crazy dilemma that we've been in most of you are good soft hearted people  when you were younger you cared about the whole world and at some point somebody said you had to pick an issue you had to boil your love down to an issue the whole world you've got to work on trees or you've got to work on immigration you've got to shrink it down and be about one issue and really well when you start working on issues like plastic you realize that the whole thing is connected and luckily most of us are blessed to have two arms we can hug both thank you very much not only would it have been burned in engines and added to global warming but there's a place called cancer alley and the reason it's called cancer alley is because the petrochemical industry takes that oil and turns it into plastic and in the process kills people it shortens the lives of the people who live there in the gulf so oil and petrochemicals are not just a problem when there's a spill they're a problem when there's not ,I am honored to be here and I'm honored to talk about this topic which I think is of grave importance I we've been talking a lot about the horrific impacts of plastic on the planet and another species are the plastic I hurt people too especially poor people and both in the production of plastic the use of plastic and a disposable plastic the people who have the Bulls play on their foreheads are for people people got very upset when the BP oil spill happened for a very good reason people thought about oh my God this is terrible this oil is it sits in the water that's going to destroy the the living systems there are people are going to be hurt this is a terrible thing as a soil is going to hurt the people in the Gulf what people don't think about is what if the oil had made it safely to shore. what are the oil that actually got where it was trying to go Not only would have been burned in in engines and added to global warming but there's a place called cancer alley and the reason it's called cancer alley is because the petrochemical industry takes that oil and turns it into plastic and in the process kills people it shortens the life of the people who live there in the Gulf so oil and petrochemicals are not just a problem when there's a spill is a problem that when there's not and what we don't often appreciate is the price that poor people pay for us to have these disposable products did I think we often don't appreciate it it's not just at the point of production that poor people suffer for you also suffer at the point of use those of us who are in a certain income level we have something called Choice the reason you want to work hard and have a job and not be poor and broke it so you can have choices economic choices we actually get a chance to choose not to use products have Danger. poisons plastic in them other people who are poor don't have those choices so low income people often are the ones who are buying the products that have those dangerous chemicals in them that their children are using those are the people who wind up actually ingesting a disproportionate amount of the poisonous classic and using it he was like well they should just buy a different product will depart the flip I was being poor is you don't have those choices you often have to buy the cheapest products the cheapest product products are often the most dangerous and if that weren't bad enough if it wasn't just the production of plastic that's giving people cancer in places like cancer alley in shortening lives and hurting for kids at the point of views at the point of disposal once again it's poor people who bear the burden often than we think we're doing a good thing you know you're in your office me drinking your your your your bottle water whatever it is and you think yourself hey I'm going to throw this away know I'm going to be virtuous I'm going to put it in the blue bin you know anything I put mine in the blue bin and then. did you look at your college you know you put yours in the white Daniel. but if we were married and you know so we kind of had a moral feel-good moment but if we were to be able to follow that little bottle on its Journey we would be shocked to discover that all too often that bottle is going to be put on a boat it's going to go all the way across the ocean at some expense and it's going to wind up in a developing country off in China had to get our minds we imagined somebody's going to take the little bottle little bottle you know we're so happy to see you little bottle. you served so well you know if you get a little bottle massage you know a little bottle metal what would you like to do next but that's not actually what happened that bottle wines up getting burned recycling a plastic in many developing countries is means the incineration of the plastic the burning of the plastic which it really is incredible toxic chemicals and once again kills people and so a poor people who are making these products and petrochemical sectors like cancer alley for people were consuming these products is proportionally and then for people who even at the at the tail end of the recycling or are having their lives are all being harmed greatly by this addiction that we have two disposability they think yourself. when are you are you say that sure is terrible for those poor people like it's just awful those those those poor people I hope someone does something help them but what we don't understand is. here we are in Los Angeles we worked very hard to get the smog reduction Happening Here in Los Angeles but guess what because they're doing so much dirty production in Asia now because the environmental laws if I don't protect the people in Asia knew almost all of the Clean Air games in a toxic are games that we've achieved here in California have been wiped out by Dirty are coming over from Asia so we all are being hit we all are being impacted is just the poor people get good at the first and worst but the dirty production the burning of toxins or the lack of environmental standards in Asia is actually creating so much dirty air pollution is coming across the ocean and has a race car games here in California we're back where we were in 1970 and so we are on one planet and we have to be able to get to the root of this problem will the root of this problem in my view is the idea of disposability itself you see if you understand the link between the what we're doing to poison and pollute. the planet and what we're doing to put the poor people you would arrive at a very troubling but also very helpful insight. in order to trash the planet you have to trash people but if you create a world where you don't trash people you can't trash the planet so it's really now we are at a moment where the coming together of social justice is an idea and ecology has an idea we we finally can now see that they are really in the end of the day one idea and it's the idea that we don't have disposable anything we don't have disposable resources we don't have disposable species and we don't have disposable people either we don't we don't have a throwaway plan it and we don't have throw away children it's all precious and as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding new opportunities for Action begin to emerge biomimicry which is something that is an emerging science winds up being a very important social justice idea people who are just learning about this stuff biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species democracy by the. I need this back in the wisdom of all people and we'll get to that but biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species it turns out you know we're pretty clever species and his big you know cortex whatever pretty proud of ourselves but we want to make something hard you know become a hard stuff since I know I'm going to get me a vacuums and furnaces and Drax up out of the ground and poison apple would like. There's a hard thing you know. I'm so clever you know you look behind you this destruction all around you but guess what you're so clever as clever as a clam clam shells hard no vacuums is no big furnace has there's no poison there's no pollution it turns out that our other species has figured out a long time ago had a great many things that we need using biological process that nature knows how to use well well that inside of biomimicry of our science is finally realizing that we have is much to learn from other species I don't mean you know that they can a mouse and you know I was leaving from that way you know abusing a little species I mean actually respecting them respecting what they've achieved that's called biomimicry and that opens the door to zero waste production zero pollution reduction that we could actually enjoy a high quality of life a high standard of living without trash in the planet will that idea. of biomimicry respecting the wisdom of all species combined with the idea of democracy and social justice respecting the wisdom in the worth of all people would give us a different Society we would have a different economy we would have a green Society the doctor king would be proud of that should be the goal and that the way that we get there it's the first of all recognized that the idea of disposability not only hurts this week as we talked about but it's even a corrupt our own Society were so proud to live here in California you know we just got this vote nearby as like well not in our state you know either I don't know what the. and I was just so proud. and yeah I'm about to but California that do we lead the world in some of the green stuff we also unfortunately lead the world in some of the gulags California has the highest incarceration rates of all the 50 states so we are where we have a moral challenge in this movie We're passionate about rescuing some dead materials from the landfill but sometimes not as passionate about rescuing living beings living people and I would say that we live in a country 5% of the world's population 25% of greenhouse gases. but also 25% of the world's prisoners one out of every four people locked up anywhere in the world is locked up right here in the United States so that is consistent with this idea that disposability it's something we believe in and yet as a as a movement that has to broaden constituency that has to grow that has to reach out beyond our natural comfort zone one of the challenges to the success of this movement of getting rid of things like plastic and helping the economy shifted its people look at our movement with some suspicion and what they asked a question and the question is how can these people be so passionate about your personal low-income person somebody and cancer alley somebody you know in what somebody in Harlem somebody on the Indian reservation and rightfully so how can these people be so passionate about making sure that a plastic bottle has a second chance in life. aluminum can has a second chance and yet when my child gets in trouble and goes to prison he doesn't get a second chance. Talk to this movement be so passionate about saying we don't have throw away stuff no throw away did materials and yet except throw away lives and throw away communities like cancer alley and so we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movie I will check on topics like this it gives us that extra call to reach out to other movements in to become more inclusive and to grow and we can finally get out of this crazy delimited we've been in most of you a good soft hearted people when you're younger you cared about the whole world in at some point somebody said you had to pick up to pick up an issue that you have to boil Your Love down to an issue I got to work on that work on trees or you got to work on immigration you got it straight down to be about one issue and really they finally told you. are you going to hug a tree. are you going to have your child a tree or going to have your child well when you start working issues like class if you realize that the whole thing is connected and luckily most of us are blessed to have two arms we can hug both thank you very much.Sharon Bus video on the Human net worth Cisco welcome to the human Network,0.73828125
NicMarks_2010G,a deer a deer freezes very very still  poised to run away asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change people are freezing and running away because we're using fear and i think the environmental movement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is what would it be like to be improving the human lot and one of the problems that we face i think is that the only people that have cornered the market in terms of progress  is a financial definition of what progress is an economic definition of what progress is that somehow if we get the right numbers to go up  economic growth that somehow life is going to get better  this is somehow appealing to human greed instead of fear that more is better come on in the western world we have enough and we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations in fact the architect of our national accounting system simon kuznets in the nineteen thirties said that a nation 's welfare can scarcely be inferred from their national income  but we've created a national accounting system which is firmly based on production and producing stuff and indeed this is probably historical and it had its time did not say in the second world war we needed to produce a lot of stuff and indeed we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff that we destroyed a lot of europe and we had to rebuild it afterwards this visionary man robert kennedy at the start of his ill fated presidential campaign gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product that ever has been and he finished his talk with the phrase that the gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile when he inspired the civil rights how crazy is that that our measure of progress our dominant measure of progress in society is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile i believe if kennedy was alive today be asking statisticians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life worthwhile he'd be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon he said i have a dream such important things as social justice sustainability and people 's well being and actually social scientists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world and unsurprisingly people all around the world that what they want is happiness for themselves for their families their children their communities okay they think money is slightly important it's there we all need to love and be loved in life it's not nearly as important as health we want to be healthy and live a full life these seem to be natural human aspirations why are statisticians not measuring these why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms instead of just how much stuff we have we created at the organization that i work for the new economics foundation something we call the happy planet index because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy why don't we create a measure of progress that shows that and what we do is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens that should be the goal of every nation on the planet but we have to remember that there's a fundamental input to that  and that is how many of the planet 's resources we use  and this is going to be a challenge we all have one planet we all have to share it it is the ultimate scarce resource the one planet that we share and economics is very interested in scarcity when it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome it thinks in terms of efficiency it thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck  because if you think of every major blockbusting film of recent times and this is a measure of how much well being we get for our planetary resource use it is an efficiency measure and probably the easiest way to show you is to show you this graph running horizontally along the  running vertically upwards is a measure called happy life years it's about the well being of nations it's like a happiness adjusted life expectancy it's like quality and quantity of life in nations and the yellow dot there you see is the global average now there's a huge array of nations around that global average to the top right of the graph nearly all of its visions for humanity are apocalyptic in hobbesian terms life is short and brutish there the average life expectancy in many of these countries is only forty years malaria hiv aids are killing a lot of people in these regions of the world but now for the good news there are some countries up there yellow triangles that are doing better than global average that are heading up towards the top left of the graph this is an aspirational graph we want to be top left where good lives don't cost the earth they're latin american the country on its own up at the top a place i haven't been to maybe some of you have i think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times the road they are according to the latest gallup world poll the happiest nation on the planet  anybody more than switzerland and it's a beautiful piece of filmmaking but everything is desolate  programs health and education they have one of the highest literacy rates in latin america and in the world  latin vibe don't they they have the social connectedness and the challenge really is to pull the global average up here that's what we need to do and if we're going to do that we need to pull countries from the bottom and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph and then we're starting to create  and this is the trend in well being over that time a small increase but this is the trend in ecological footprint and just a father and son trying to survive  actually not very long away it's half a human lifetime away a child entering school today will be my age in two thousand and fifty this is not the very distant future this is what the u k government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like  and i put it to you that not business as usual that is changing our business that is changing the way we we do our government policy and we live our lives we need to carry on increasing well being no one can go to the polls and say that quality of life is going to reduce none of us i think want human progress to and i think the environmental movement of which i am a i think we want it to carry on i think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing and i think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in i think this is what they want they want quality of life to keep increasing they want to hold on to what they've got and if we're going to engage them i think that's what we've got to do and that means we have to really increase efficiency even more now that's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that but the point is we need to turn those curves and this is where i think we can take a leaf out of systems theory systems engineers where they create feedback loops put the right information at the right point of time human beings are very motivated by the now you put a smart meter in your home and you see how much electricity you're using right now how much it's costing you your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly what would that look like for society  and why do i hear that why don't i hear how much energy britain used yesterday or american used yesterday  did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions that's how you create a collective goal you put it out there into the media and start thinking about it and we need positive feedback loops for increasing well being at a government level they might create national accounts of well being at a business level you might look at the well being of your employees which we know is really linked to creativity which is linked to innovation we have peddled a nightmarish vision of what's going to a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues at a personal level we need these nudges too in the u k we have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do never my best thing what are these for happiness what are the five things that you should do every day to be piece of work we did was on what five positive actions can you do to improve well being in your life and the point of these is they are we have focused on the worst case scenario not quite the secrets of happiness but they are things that i think happiness will flow out the side from and the first of these is to connect is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do and energy keep building them the second one is be active the fastest way out of a bad mood step outside go for a walk turn the radio on and we have focused on the problems and we have not thought enough about the solutions how aware are you of things going on around the world the seasons changing people around you do you notice what's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge  based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness cognitive behavioral therapy strong for our well being the fourth is keep learning and keep is important learning throughout the whole life course older people who keep learning and are curious they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down but it doesn't have to be formal learning it's not knowledge based it's more curiosity it can be learning to cook a new dish keep learning and the final one is that most anti economic of activities but give our generosity our altruism our compassion are all hardwired to the reward mechanism in our brain we feel good if we give you can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning you tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people used fear if you like to grab people 's attention you measure their happiness at the end of the day those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier that those that spent it on themselves and these five ways which we put onto these handy postcards i would say don't have to cost the earth they don't have any carbon content they don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied and so i think it's really quite feasible that happiness does not cost the earth on the eve of his death gave an incredible speech he said i know there are challenges ahead there may be trouble ahead  but i fear no one i don't care i have been to the mountain top and i have seen the promised land and any psychologist will tell you he was a preacher but i believe the environmental movement and in fact the business community government needs to go to the top of the mountain top and it needs to look out and it needs to see the promised land or the land of promise and it needs to have a vision of a world that we all want and not only that we need to create a great transition to get there and we need to pave that great transition with good things human beings want to be happy pave them with the five ways and we need to have signposts gathering people together and pointing them something like the happy planet index and then i believe in the organism is linked to flight mechanism it's part of the fight and flight mechanism  that we can all create a world we all want ,Martin Luther King. did not say I have a nightmare when he inspired the Civil Rights Movement. he said I have a dream. I know I have a dream. I have a dream that we can stop thinking that the future will be a nightmare. and this is going to be a challenge because if you think of every major blockbusting film of recent times. nearly all of its patients for Humanity or apocalyptic I think this field is one of the hottest watches of modern times the road it's a beautiful piece of filmmaking but everything is desolate everything is dead. I'm just a father and son trying to survive walking along the road and I think the environmental movement of which I am a part of has been complicit in creating this vision of the future for too long we have paddled a nightmarish vision of what's going to happen we have focused on the worst case scenario we have focused on the problems and we have not thought enough about the solutions. we use fair if you like to grab people's attention. an any psychologist will tell you. that spear in the organism is linked to the flight mechanism is part of the fight or flight mechanism that when an animal is frightened think of a deer a deer freezes very very still poised to run away and I think that's what we doing on asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change people are freezing and running away because we using fear and I think the environmental movement has to grow up and stop to think about what progress is what would it be like to be improving the human thoughts. I'm one of the problems that we face I think is that the only people that wanted the market and Sons of progress. is a financial definition of what progress has an economic definition of what progress is the somehow if we get the right numbers to go up. we're going to be better off. but that's on the stock market's where that Sue GDP and economic growth the somehow life is going to get better. this is somehow appealing to human greed instead of fear the more is better come on in the western well we have enough maybe some parts of the world end but we have enough time we've known for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations in fact the architect of all national accounting system Simon kuznets in the 1930s said that a nation's wealth that can scarcely be inferred from the national income. but we created a national accounting system which is firmly based on production and producing stuff I didn't see this is probably historical that had its time in the second what we needed to produce a lot of stuff I didn't think he was so successful in producing certain types of stuff that we destroyed the look you up when we have to rebuild it off to us. and so on National accounting system became fixated on what we can produce. what is early as 1968 this Vision remind Robert Kennedy at the stop his ill-fated presidential campaign gave the most eloquent deconstruction of Bryce national product the ever has been and he finished his talk with a phrase that the gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile how crazy is that that I'll measure of progress all dominant measure progress in society is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile. I believe is Kennedy was alive today you'll be asking statisticians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life worthwhile going on National accounting system to be based upon such important things is social justice sustainability and people's well-being and actually social science is already going out on all these questions around the world this is from a global survey asking people what they want and unsurprisingly people around the world so that what they want is happiness for themselves for the families that children that communities okay they think money is slightly important it's that but it's not nearly as important as happiness is not nearly as important as love we all need to love and be loved in life it's not nearly as important as hell we want to be healthy and live a full life. he seems to be natural human aspirations why is that the station's not measuring that why we not thinking of the progress of nations in these times instead of just how much stuff we have I'm ready this is what I've done with my adult life I think about how do we measure happiness how do we measure well-being how can we do that with environmental limits. I'm weak right that the organization I work for the new economics Foundation something we cool. I have to find an index. because we think people should be happy in the planet should be happy why don't we pray a measure of progress that shows that I won't we do if we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful are creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens that should be the goal of Every Nation on the planet but we have to remember that there's a fundamental input so that I know how many of the planet's resources we use. you'll have one planet we won't have to share it it is the ultimate scarce resource the one planet that we share an economics is very interested in this caste has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome it thinks in terms of efficiency I think sometimes of how much bang do we get for a buck. and this is a measure of how much well-being we get for a planetary resources it is an efficiency measure running horizontally on the ground is ecologically footprint which is the measure of how much resources would use and how much pressure we put on the planet is bad words is a magical happy life is it's about the well-being of Nations it's like a happiness adjusted life expectancy it's like quality and quantity of life and Nations and the other dog that you see is the global average that is a huge array of Nations around that global average to the top right side of the garage with all countries which are doing reasonably well in producing well-being but that using a lot of planet to get that. they all the u.s.a. other Western countries during a Crossing those triangles and if you've got steaks in there actually at the bottom left of the graph of countries that are not producing much while being typically sub-Saharan Africa. and hopefully in terms life is short and brutish that average life expectancy and many of these countries is only for two years. malaria hiv-aids are killing a lot of people in these regions of the world. there are some countries that the yellow triangles that thing faster than Glyburide be heading out towards the top left of the graph this is an aspirational raw we want to be talked last week good life think of the earth that Latin American the country on its own but the top is a place I haven't been to maybe some of you have. Costa Rica. Costa Rica average life expectancy is 78 and a half years that is longer than in the USA. they are putting to the latest Gallup will Poe the happiest Nation on the planet. than anybody in Switzerland until now they are the happiest place of the resources that I used typically in Western weld a quarter of the resources. what time is it in Costa Rica we can look at some of the Dyson 99% of their electricity comes from renewable resources the first to commit to be carbon neutral by 2021. they abolish the Army in 1949 and 1949 and they invested in Social programs health and education they have one of the highest literacy rate in Latin America and in the world. and they have that Latin vibe that they have the social connectedness. Challenges possibly and then we might have to think about is that the future might not be North American might not be Western European it might be Latin American. and the challenge really is to pull the global average up here that's what we need to do and if we're going to do that we need to pull countries from the bottom I mean it's a coupon trees from the right of the draw and then we're starting to create I have to plan it that's one way of looking at it another way of looking at it is looking at time Trends we don't have good days to go back for every country in the world but for some of the richest countries the ABCD group we do and this is the trending well-being over that time a small increase but this is a trend an ecologically footprint 7th strict happy Planet methodology we've become less efficient but turning around too much gas resource into the outcome we want to. on the point where it is is I think probably everybody in this room would like Society to get to 2050 without an apocalyptic something happening. it's actually not very long way it's hard for human lifetime away it's a child entering school today will be my age in 2050 this is not the very distant future. this is what the UK government Target on Corbin and Greenhouse emissions looks like. and I put you that is not business as usual. that is changing our business that is changing the way we cry organizations we do our government policy and we live our lives and the point is we need to carry on increasing well-being no one can go to the polls and say the quality of life is going to reduce none of us I think one human progress. I think they wanted to keep on increasing and I think this is where climate change Skeptics engine is coming I think this is what they want they want quality of life to keep increasing they want to hold on to what they've got and if they could engage them I think that's what we. and that means we have to read increase efficiency even more than that so very easy to draw bras and things like that but the point is we need to turn those Cubs and this is where I think we can take a leaf out of systems theory systems engineer is where they crave feedback loops put the right information of the right point of time human beings a very motivated by the now you put a smart meter in your home and you see how much electricity you using right now how much is it costing you your kids go round and turn the lights off pretty quickly what was that look like the society why is it on the news the evening I hear the ftse 100 the Dow Jones that's all the time right you didn't know which way the dollar pound should go to be good news and why do you say that why don't I hear how much energy Britain use yesterday or America please yesterday. did we meet on 3% annual Target on reducing carbon emissions that's how you create a flight to go you put it out there into the media stop thinking about it and we need positive feedback loops for increasing while being at government level they might fight national accounts as well being at a business level you might look at the well-being of your employees which we know is already linked to creativity which is linked to Innovation I'm going to need a lot of innovation to deal with eyes environmental issues at a personal level we need these notches two maybe we don't quite neat that they see but we need reminders we in the UK we have a strong Public Health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do nevermind best thing. what are the five things that you should do everyday to be happy and we did a project for the government office of science couple years ago big program pulled the full site parking lots and lots of people involved in everything evidence-based a huge tone but a piece of what we did was on what five positive actions can you do to improve well-being in your life and the point of these are things that I think happiness will flat-out the side from and the first of these is to connect is it your social relationships of the most important cornerstones of your life do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do at energy. keep building them the second one is Be Active fastest way out of a bad mood stuff outside go through turn the radio on its own. being active is great for a positive mood. the third one is take notice how aware of your things going on around the world Seasons changing people around you do you notice what's popping out for you and trying to emerge based on the evidence for mindfulness cognitive behavioral therapy very strong for my well-being. the fourth is keep learning and keep is important learning throughout the whole life course I would have people who keep learning and a curious they have much better health outcomes in those to start the clothes down but it doesn't have to be formal.. Can be learning to cook a new dish picking up an instrument you forgot as a child keep learning. and the final one is that most Auntie economic activities but give our generosity or altruism or compassion to the Magnificent our brain we feel good if we give you can do an experiment where you give two groups of people $100 in the morning you tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one of the people you mentioned that happiness at the end of the day that they were going to spend some of the people that much happier than those who spent it on themselves and these five ways which we put on to these handy postcards. I would say don't have to come see us they don't have any cop content they don't need a lot of material Goods to be satisfied and so I think it's really quite feasible to happiness does not cuss. no Martin Luther King. on the eve of his death gave an incredible speech. he said I know there were challenges ahead there may be trouble ahead but I feel and I won I don't care I have been to the Mountaintop and I have seen the promised land and he was a preacher but I believe the environmental movement and in fact business Community government needs to go to the top of the mountain salt and it needs to look at house I didn't needs to see the promised land was a land of promise. I didn't used to have a vision of a world that we all want. I'm not any of that we need to create a great transition to get there and we need to pay that great transition with good things human beings who wants to be happy paid them with the five ways how many time a signpost gathering people together and pointing to them something like the Happy pie in that day and then I believe that we can talk real well we want my happiness does not cost the Earth. investment in Broadband high-speed internet can help small businesses create new American jobs small businesses are being formed dreams are being launched and it AT&T we're investing billions to upgrade and build out our wired and wireless networks now is not the time to stall momentum or stifle Innovation or investment jobs dreams and the future are at stake AT&T you are World delivered,0.78515625
