0,AJJacobs_2007P.sph.wav,i've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave so it's about choosing the parts of the bible about compassion about tolerance about loving your neighbor as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin or intolerance or violence which are very much in the bible as well so if we are to find any meaning in this book then we have to really engage it and wrestle with it and i thought i'd end with just a couple more there's me reading the bible that's how i hailed taxi cabs morning but it served well for a day so anyway thank you so much for letting me so and it was about the year i spent reading the encyclopedia britannica from a to z in my quest to learn everything in the world or more precisely from which is a type of east asian music all the way to zwyiec which is well i don't although listening to kevin kelly you don't have to remember anything you can just google it so i wasted some time there i love those experiments but i think that the most profound and life changing experiment that i've done is my most recent experiment i thought i'd tell you a little about what i like to write and i like to immerse myself in my topics i just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig and where i spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the bible the year of living biblically and i undertook this for two reasons the first was that i grew up with no religion at all as i say in my book i'm jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian so but i've become increasingly interested in religion i do think it's the defining issue of our time or one of the main ones and i have a son i want to know what to teach him so i decided to dive in head first and try to live the bible the second reason i undertook this is because i'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism religious fundamentalism and people who say what if you really did take the bible literally i decided to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the bible literally without picking and choosing the first thing i did was i got a stack of bibles i had christian bibles i had jewish bibles a friend of mine sent me something called a hip hop bible where the twenty three rd psalm is rendered as the lord is all that as opposed to what i knew it as the lord is my shepherd then i went down and i read several versions and i wrote down every single law that i could find and this was a very long list over seven hundred rules and they range from the famous ones that i had heard of the ten commandments love your neighbor be fruitful and multiply so i wanted to follow those and actually i take my projects very seriously because i had twins during my year so i definitely take my projects seriously but i also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the bible there is the law in leviticus you cannot shave the corners of your beard i didn't know where my corners were so i decided to let the whole thing grow and this is what i looked like by the end as you can imagine i spent a lot of time at airport security my wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months so certainly the challenge was there the bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers so i thought sounds strange but i'll try it you only know i see my life as a series of experiments so i work for esquire magazine and a couple of years ago i wrote an article called my outsourced life i got rid of all my poly cotton t shirts the bible says that if two men are in a fight and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other her hand shall be cut off so i wanted to follow that rule wife was standing nearby looking like she had a strong grip so there's another shot of my beard i will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing and incredibly challenging and there were two types of laws were particularly challenging the first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day know i could spend a year not killing but spending a year not gossiping not coveting not lying you know i live in new york and i work as a journalist so this was seventy five eighty percent of my but it was really interesting because i was able to make some progress because i couldn't believe how my behavior changed my thoughts this was one of the huge lessons of the year is that i almost pretended to be a better person and i became a little bit of a better person so i had always thought you know you change your mind and you change your behavior but it's often the other way round you change your behavior and you change your mind so you know if you want to become more compassionate you visit sick people in the hospital and you will become more compassionate where i hired a team of people in bangalore india to live my life for me so they answered my emails they answered my phone they argued with my wife for me and they you donate money to a cause and you become emotionally involved in that cause so it really was cognitive psychology that if you smile you will become happier which as we know is actually true the second type of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty one st century america and the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers but it's a big part of the bible so i had to address i was able to stone one adulterer it happened i was in the park and i was dressed in my biblical clothing sandals and a white robe you know because again the outer see how dressing biblically affected my mind up to me and he said why are you dressed like that and i explained my project and he said well i am an adulterer are you going to stone me and i said well that would be great and i took out a handful of stones from my pocket that i had been carrying around for weeks hoping for just this interaction and you know they were pebbles out of my hand he was actually an elderly man mid seventies just so you know but he 's still an adulterer and still quite angry he grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face and i felt that i could eye for an eye i could retaliate and throw one back at him so that was my experience stoning and it did allow me to talk about in a more serious way these big issues how can the bible be so barbaric in some places and yet so incredibly wise in others it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years and it's sort of evolved it's not a book that was written and came down from on high my son bedtime stories it was the best month of my life because i just sat back and i read books and watched movies so i thought i would end by telling you just a couple of the take away the bigger lessons that i learned from my year the first is thou shalt not take the bible literally this very very clear early on because if you do then you end up acting like a crazy person and stoning adulterers or here well that's another i did spend some time shepherding it's a very relaxing vocation i recommend it but this one is and my wife thought this was very offensive so she sat in every seat in our apartment and i had to spend much of the year standing until i bought my own seat and carried it around so you know i met with creationists i went to the creationists museum and these are the ultimate literalists and it was fascinating because they were not stupid people at all that they distort all the data to fit their model and they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this and i will say though was a wonderful experience more recently i wrote an article for esquire called about radical honesty and this is a movement the museum is gorgeous they really did a fantastic job if you're ever in kentucky there's i think it's crazy they did a great job another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks and this one was a big lesson because i was praying giving these prayers of thanksgiving which was odd for an agnostic but saying thanks all the time every day and i started to change my perspective and i started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day that i didn't even notice that i took for granted as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong so this is actually a key to happiness for me is to just remember when i came over here the car didn't flip over and i didn't trip coming up the stairs it's a remarkable thing this one was unexpected because i started the year as an agnostic and by the end of the year i became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic which i love a movement so if anyone wants to join the basic idea is whether or not there is a god there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness and that our rituals can be sacred the sabbath can be this was one of the great things about my year doing the sabbath because i am a workaholic so having this one day where you cannot work it really that changed my life this is started by a psychologist in virginia who says that you should never ever lie except maybe during poker and golf his only exceptions and more than that journey i wanted it to be about religion in america so i spent time with evangelical christians and hasidic jews and the i'm very proud because i think i'm the only person in america to out bible talk a jehovah 's witness thank you but it was because i had some very preconceived notions about for instance evangelical christianity and i found that it's such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it there's a group i met with called the red letter christians and they focus on words in the bible which are the ones that jesus spoke that's how they printed them in the old bibles and is that jesus never talked about homosexuality they have a pamphlet that says here 's what jesus said about homosexuality and you open it up and there's nothing in it so they say jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts helping poor people so this was very inspiring to me i recommend jim wallace and tony campolo they're very inspiring leaders even though i disagree with much of what they say also thou shalt not i was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces and the thing is if they're not harmful they're not to be completely dismissed because i learned that i was thinking i was doing all these rituals these biblical rituals separating my and linen and i would ask these religious people why would the bible possibly tell us to do this why would god care and they said we don't know but it's just rituals that give us meaning and i would say but that's crazy and they would say well what about you you blow out candles on top of a birthday cake if a guy from mars came down and saw here 's one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics would the martians say well that he makes sense but that guy 's crazy so no i think that are not harmful but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed and finally i learned that thou shall pick and choose and this one i learned because i tried to follow everything in the bible and i failed miserably because you can 't you have to pick and choose and anyone who follows the bible is going to be picking and choosing the key is i do not recommend this at all to give you a sense of the experience the article was called i think you're fat to pick and choose the right parts there's the phrase called my argument is what 's wrong with cafeterias i've had some great meals at cafeterias,1
1,AaronHuey_2010X.sph.wav,we have indeed taken the best part of the meat so let 's look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain and know that when you see these people 's faces that these are not just images of the lakota they stand for all indigenous people on this piece of paper is the history the way i learned it from my lakota friends and family i'm here today to show my photographs of the lakota many of you may have heard of the lakota or at least the larger group of tribes called sixty six the beginning of the transcontinental railroad a new era we appropriated land for trails and trains to shortcut through the heart of the lakota nation the treaties were out the window in response three tribes led by the lakota chief red cloud attacked and defeated the u s army many times over i want to repeat that part the lakota defeat the u s army sixty eight the second fort laramie treaty clearly guarantees the sovereignty of the great sioux nation and the lakotas ownership of the sacred black hills the lakota are one of many tribes that were moved off their land to prisoner of war camps now called reservations the pine ridge reservation seventy one the indian appropriation act makes all indians wards of the federal government in addition the military issued orders forbidding western indians from leaving reservations the move destroyed the reservations making it easier to further subdivide and to sell with every passing generation most of the surplus land i believe to be the most important in this slide show this is the year of the wounded knee massacre to this day this is the most medals of honor ever awarded for a single battle more medals of honor were given for the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children than for any battle in world war one world war two korea vietnam iraq or afghanistan the wounded knee massacre is considered the end of the indian wars whenever i visit the site of the mass grave at wounded knee now if any of you have ever heard of aim the american indian movement or of russell means or leonard peltier or of the stand off at oglala i see it not just a grave for the lakota or for the sioux but as a grave for all indigenous peoples the holy man black elk said i did not know then how much was ended when i look back now from this high hill of my old age i can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch when i saw them with eyes still young and i can see that something else died there in the bloody mud and was buried in the blizzard a people 's dream died there and it was a beautiful dream with this event a new era in native american history began everything can be measured before wounded knee and after because it was in this moment with the fingers on the triggers of the hotchkiss guns the court determined that when the sioux were resettled onto reservations and seven million acres of their land were opened up to prospectors and homesteaders the terms of the second fort laramie treaty had been violated the court stated that the black hills were illegally taken and that the initial offering price plus interest should be paid to the sioux nation ten statistics about native population today more than a century after the massacre at wounded knee reveal the legacy of colonization forced migration and treaty violations at least sixty percent of the homes on the reservation are infested with black mold more than ninety percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line the tuberculosis rate on pine ridge is approximately eight times higher than the u s national average the infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent and is about three times higher than the u s national average the last chapter in any successful genocide is the one in which the oppressor can remove their hands and say my god what are these people doing to themselves they're killing each other they're killing themselves while we watch them die this is how we came to own these united states this is the legacy of manifest destiny prisoners are still born into prisoner of war camps long after the guards are gone these are the bones left after the best meat has been has been taken a long time ago a series of events was set in motion by a people who look like me by wasichu eager to take the land and the water and the gold in the hills those events led to a domino effect that has yet to end as removed as we the dominant society may feel what is the connection between these images of suffering and the history that i just read to you and how much of this history do you need to own even is any of this your responsibility today been told that there must be something we can do there must be some call to action because for so long i've been standing on the sidelines content to be a witness just taking photographs because the solution seems so far in the past i needed nothing short of a time machine to access them the suffering of indigenous peoples is not a simple issue to fix it's not something everyone can get behind the way they get behind helping haiti of ending aids or fighting a famine and invited me again and again over five years but on pine ridge i will always be what is called wasichu and wasichu is a lakota word the fix as it's called may be much more difficult for the dominant society than say a fifty dollar check or church trip to paint some graffiti covered houses or a suburban family donating a box of clothes they don't even want anymore so where does that leave us shrugging our shoulders in the dark the call to action i offer today my ted wish is this honor the treaties give back the black hills it's not your business what they do with them that means non indian but another version of this word means the one who takes the best meat for himself and that's what i want to focus on the one who takes the best part of the meat it means greedy,1
2,AdamGrosser_2007.sph.wav,and then as the ammonia re evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side it creates a powerful cooling effect so it was a great idea that didn't work at all it blew up because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong it topped four hundred psi the ammonia was toxic it sprayed everywhere but it was kind of an interesting thought so the great thing about two thousand and six is there's a lot of really great computational work you can do so we got the whole thermodynamics department at stanford involved a lot of computational fluid dynamics we proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong we found some non toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures this is a work in process based on some comments that were made at ted two years ago about the need for the put it into a container and it will refrigerate for twenty four hours it looks like this this is the fifth prototype it's not quite done weighs about eight pounds,1
3,AdamSadowsky_2010X.sph.wav,we came up with a list of they wanted band integration that is the machine acting upon the band members specifically not the other way around they wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling so as the song picks up emotion so should the machine get grander in its process they wanted us to make use of the space so we have this ten thousand sq ft warehouse we were using divided between two floors it included an exterior loading dock we used all of that including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through they wanted it messy and we were happy to oblige hi there i'm going to be talking a little bit about music machines and life the machine itself would start the music so the machine would get started it would travel some distance reacting along the way hit play on an ipod or a tape deck or something that would start playback and the machine would maintain synchronization throughout and speaking of synchronization they wanted it to sync to the rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way they wanted it to end precisely on time okay so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect and they wanted the music to drop out at a certain point in the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song and as if that wasn't enough all of these incredibly complicating things right they wanted it in one shot okay so just some statistics about sort of what we went through in the process the machine itself has eighty nine distinct interactions or more specifically what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video some of you may recognize this image this is the opening frame of the video that we created it took us eighty five takes to get it on film to our satisfaction of those eighty five takes only three actually successfully completed their we destroyed two pianos and ten televisions in the process we went to home depot well over a hundred times and we lost one high heeled shoe when one of our engineers heather knight left her high heeled shoe after a nice dinner and returned back to the build and left it in a pile of stuff and another engineer thought well that would be a really good thing to use and ended up using it as a really nice trigger and it's actually in the machine so what did we learn from all of this well having completed this we have the opportunity to step back and reflect on some of the things and we learned that small stuff stinks little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust and they fall out of the tracks the exact angles makes it hard to get right and yet a bowling ball will always follow the same path it doesn't matter what temperature it is doesn't matter what's in its way it will pretty much get where it needs to go but as much as the small stuff stinks we needed somewhere to start so that we would have somewhere to go and so you have to start with it you have to focus on it small stuff stinks what else planning is incredibly important you know we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things it's been said that no battle plan survives contact with the enemy i think our enemy was physics and she's a cruel mistress often we had to pull things out as a result because of timing or aesthetics or whatever and so while planning is important so is flexibility these are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine be showing the video at the end but before we do i want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted now when we first started talking to ok go the name of the song is this too shall pass real car near the end of the video the big real car works every time there's no problem about it the little one had a tendency to try to run off the track and that's a problem but you don't want to have to reset the whole machine because the lego car at the end doesn't work right so you put that up front so that if it fails at least you know you don't have to reset the whole thing can be were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing months were spent in this tiny cold warehouse and the wonderful elation that we this too shall pass we the they've done we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with and we were very excited about this because of course they have a history of dancing with machines we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted and they explained that they wanted kind of a rube goldberg machine now for those of you who don't know a rube goldberg machine is a so we were excited by this idea and we started talking about exactly what it would look like and we came up with some parameters,1
4,AdamSavage_2008P.sph.wav,and i thought to myself wouldn't it be great if i had my own dodo skeleton and so i want to point out here at this point that my life obsessed by objects and the stories that they tell and this was the very latest one so i began looking around for to see if anyone sold a some kind of model that i could get and i found lots of reference material lots of lovely pictures no dice no dodo skeleton for me but the damage had been done i had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my creative projects folder it's a repository for my brain everything that i could possibly be interested in any time i have an internet connection there's a sluice of stuff moving into there everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos the key that the marquis du lafayette sent to george washington to celebrate the storming of the russian nuclear launch key the one on the top is the picture of the one i found on ebay the one on the bottom is the one i made for myself because i couldn't afford the one on about four years the new yorker published an article about a cache of dodo bones that was found in a pit on the island of mauritius now the island of maybe yeah maybe i could make my own dodo skull i should point out at this time i'm not a sculptor i'm a hard edged model maker you give me a drawing you give me a prop to replicate you give me a something like this my friend mike murnane sculpted this it's a maquette for star wars episode two this is not my thing i this is something other people do dragons soft things however i felt like i had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicate it i mean it couldn't be that difficult so i started looking at the best photos i could find i grabbed all the reference and i found this lovely piece of reference this is someone selling this on ebay it was a woman 's clearly a woman a s hand hopefully a woman 's hand is a small island off the east coast of madagascar in the indian ocean and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be exactly how long et cetera et cetera and over a few hours i eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull and i didn't mean to continue i it's kind of like you know you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time you can't think about the totality i wasn't thinking about a dodo skeleton i just noticed that as i finished this skull the armature wire that i had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be and one of the other things i'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years is spines and skeletons having collected a couple of hundred i actually understood the mechanics of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them and so button by button vertebrae by vertebrae i built my way down and actually by the end of the day i had a reasonable skull a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis and again i kept on going looking for more reference every bit of reference i could find drawings beautiful photos this guy i love this guy he put a dodo leg bones in a scanner with a ruler you can see that i even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the dodo and tap plastics made me although i didn't photograph it a museum vitrine i don't have the room for this in my house but i had to finish what i had started and this actually represented kind of a sea change to me again like i said my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell and also making them for myself obtaining them appreciating them and extinguished all within about one hundred and fifty years everyone was very excited about this archeological find because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton see and diving into them and in this folder creative projects there are tons of projects that i'm currently working on projects that i've already worked on things that i might want to work on some day and things that i may just want to find and buy and have and and look at and touch but now there was potentially this new category of things that i could sculpt that was different that i you know i have my own r two d two but that's honestly relative to sculpting to me that's easy and so i went back and looked through my creative projects folder and i happened across the maltese falcon now this is funny for me to fall in love with an object from a hammett novel because if it's true that the world is divided into two types of people chandler people and hammett people i am absolutely a chandler person but in this case it's not about it's not about the author it's not about the book or the movie or the story it's about the object in and of itself and in this case this object is plays on a host of and it is very likely the object from which hammett drew his inspiration for the maltese falcon then there is the fictional bird the one that hammett created for the book built out of words it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie in which another object is created a prop that has to represent the thing that hammett created out of words inspired by the kniphauser hawk and this represents the falcon in the movie and then there is this fourth level which is while museums all over the world have dodo skeletons in their collection nobody not even the actual natural history museum on the island of mauritius has a skeleton that's made from the bones of a single dodo a whole new object in the world the prop made for the movie the representative of the thing becomes in its own right a whole other thing a whole new object of desire and so i contacted an antiquarian bookseller who had the original christie 's catalogue and in it i found this magnificent picture which included a size reference i was able to scan the picture blow it up to exactly full size it was made out of resin which wasn't a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made it's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it because i can see it compared to this thing and i can tell you it's real it's the real thing it's made from the exact same mold that this one is in this one because the auction was actually so controversial profiles in history the auction house that sold this and other side elevation so now i had all the topology i needed to replicate the maltese falcon what do they do how do you start something like that i really don't know so what i did was again like i did with the dodo skull i blew all my reference up to full size isn't exactly true the fact is is that the british museum had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the eighteenth century it was actually mummified skin and all feather by feather detail by detail i worked out and achieved working in front of the television and super sculpey here 's me sitting next to my wife it's the only picture i took of the entire process as i moved through i achieved so i went down to my shop and i molded it and i cast it in resin i ended up with this my maltese falcon and it's beautiful and i can state with authority at this point in time when i'd finished it of all of the replicas out there and there is a few this is by far the most accurate representation of the original maltese falcon than anyone has sculpted now the original one i should tell you is sculpted by a guy named fred sexton this is where it gets weird but in a fit of space saving zeal they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire if you go look at their website today they'll actually list these specimens saying the rest was lost in a fire the los angeles county museum of art had a plaster original of the maltese falcon one of the original six plasters i think made for the movie stolen out of the museum a lot of people thought it was a publicity stunt for the movie john 's grill which actually is seen briefly in the maltese falcon is still a viable san francisco eatery counted amongst its regular customers elisha cook who played wilmer cook in the movie and he gave them one of his original plasters of the maltese falcon and they had it in their cabinet for about fifteen years until it got stolen in january of two thousand and seven it would seem that the object of desire only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly so here i had this falcon and it was lovely it looked really great it the light worked on it really well it was better than anything that i could achieve or obtain out in the world but there was a problem and the problem was was that the entirety of the object i wanted the weight behind the object this thing was made of resin and it was too light there's this group online that i frequent it's a group of prop crazies just like me called the replica props forum and it's people who trade make and travel in information about movie props and it turned out that one of the guys there a friend of mine that i never actually met but befriended through some prop deals was the manager of a local foundry he took my master falcon pattern he actually did lost wax casting in bronze for me and this is the bronze i got back and this is after some acid etching the one that i ended up with and this thing it's deeply deeply satisfying to me here i'm going to i going to put it out there later on tonight and you can a i want you to pick it not quite the whole truth anyway the frontispiece of this article was this photo and i'm one of the people that thinks that tina brown was great for bringing photos to the new yorker because this photo yeah i there you can see it's weighing in at twenty seven and a half pounds that's half the weight of my dog huxley but there's a problem now here 's the most recent progression of falcons on the far left is a piece of crap a replica i bought on ebay there's my somewhat ruined sculpey falcon because i had to get it back out of the mold there's my first casting there's my master and there's my bronze that happens when you mold and cast things which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin you lose a little bit of volume you lose a little bit of size and when i held my bronze one up against my sculpey one it was shorter by three quarters of an inch why didn't i remember this why didn't i start and make it bigger so what do i do i figure i have two options one and blown this up big enough to make a three d lithography master of this which i will polish then i will send to the mold maker and then i will have it done in bronze there are several people who own originals and i have been attempting to contact them and reach them hoping that they will let me spend few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds maybe to take a picture or even to pull out the hand held laser scanner that i happen to own that fits inside a cereal box and could maybe without even touching their bird i swear get a perfect three d scan and i'm even willing to sign pages saying that i'll never let anyone else have it except for me in my office i promise i'll give them one if they want it and completely rocked my world i became obsessed with the object not just the beautiful photograph itself and the color the shallow depth of field the detail that's visible the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together there's an entire story here then maybe then i'll achieve the end of this exercise but really if we're all going to be honest with ourselves i have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with was it,1
5,AditiShankardass_2009I.sph.wav,but diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms without even doing an ecg or a chest x ray to look at the heart it seemed so intuitive to me to diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately it would be necessary to look at the brain directly looking at behavior alone can miss a vital piece of the puzzle and provide an incomplete or even a misleading picture of the child 's problems yet despite all the advances in medical technology the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited and then i came across a team at harvard university that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it instead of in brain research towards diagnosing brain disorders in children their groundbreaking technology records the eeg or the electrical activity of the brain in real time when i was ten years old a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions vision attention language a program called brain electrical activity mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain and another program called statistical probability mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child 's symptoms and so i became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team like to tell you about one such child whose story was also covered by abc news seven year old justin senigar and as a special treat he took me to the pathology lab and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands came to our clinic with this diagnosis of very severe autism like many autistic children his mind was locked inside his body there were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time and the doctors told his parents he was never going to be able to communicate or interact socially and he would probably never have too much language when we used this groundbreaking eeg technology to actually look at justin 's brain the results were startling it turned out that justin was almost certainly not autistic he was suffering from brain seizures that were impossible to see with the naked eye but that were actually causing symptoms that mimicked those of autism after justin was given anti seizure medication the change in him was amazing within a period of sixty days his vocabulary went from two to three words to three hundred words and his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled in a regular school and even became a karate superchamp research shows that fifty percent of children almost fifty percent of children diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures these are the faces of the children that i have tested with stories just like justin all these children and there it was the seat of human consciousness the powerhouse of the human body sitting in my hands came to our clinic with a diagnosis of autism attention deficit disorder mental retardation language problems instead scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn't possibly have been detected by their behavioral assessments so these eeg scans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis and much more targeted treatment for too long now children with developmental disorders have suffered from misdiagnosis while their real problems have gone undetected and left to and for too long these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation but we are now in a new era of neuroscience one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects non invasively and find the true source of so many disabilities in children so if i could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved one more mind will be unlocked and one more child who has been misdiagnosed or even undiagnosed by the system and that day i knew that when i grew up i was going to become a brain doctor scientist something or the other will finally realize his or her true potential while there's still time for his or her brain to recover and all this by simply watching the child 's brainwaves thank you years later when i finally grew up my dream came true and it was while i was doing my ph d on the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that i encountered a startling fact that i'd like to share with you all today it is estimated that one in six children that's one in six children suffer from some developmental disorder this is a disorder that retards mental development in the child and causes permanent mental impairments which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder but here 's what really perplexed me despite the fact that each and every one these disorders originates in the brain most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable behavior,1
6,AdoraSvitak_2010.sph.wav,for better or worse we kids aren't hampered as much when it comes to thinking about reasons why not to do things kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking like my wish that no one went hungry or that everything were free kind of utopia how many of you still dream like that and believe in the possibilities on the other hand we kids still dream about perfection and that's a good thing because in order to make anything a reality you have to dream about it first in many ways our audacity to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility for instance the museum of glass in tacoma washington my home state yoohoo washington now i want to start with a question when was the last time you were called childish for kids like me being called childish can be a frequent occurrence our inherent wisdom doesn't have to be insiders knowledge kids already do a lot of learning from adults teachers and students and i like this analogy it shouldn 't just be a teacher at the head of the classroom telling students do this do that the students should teach their teachers learning between grown ups and kids should be reciprocal the reality unfortunately is a little different and it has a lot to do with trust or a lack of it don't trust someone you place restrictions on them right if i doubt my older sister 's ability to pay back the ten percent interest i established on her last loan i'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me until she pays it back true story by the way to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids from every don 't do that don 't do this in the school handbook to restrictions on school internet use as history points out regimes become oppressive when they're fearful about keeping control and although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes kids have no or very little say in making the rules when really the attitude should be reciprocal meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population now what's even worse than restriction is that adults often underestimate kids abilities we love challenges but when expectations are low trust me we will sink to them to write from the age of four and when i was six my mom bought me my own laptop equipped with microsoft word thank you bill gates and thank you ma i wrote over three hundred short stories on that little laptop and i wanted to get published many publishers were not quite so encouraging one large children 's publisher ironically saying that they didn't work with children we are called childish which really bothers me after all take a look at these events imperialism and colonization and from there on it's gone to speaking at hundreds of schools keynoting to thousands of educators and finally today speaking to you i appreciate your attention today because to show that you truly care you listen but just like you really the goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult but rather better adults than you have been which may be a little challenging considering your guys credentials no matter your position of place in life it is imperative to create opportunities for children so that we can grow up to blow you away because we are the leaders of tomorrow which means we're going to be taking care of you when you're old and senile no just kidding world wars george w bush ask yourself who 's responsible really we are going to be the next generation the ones who will bring this world forward and in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you now the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas kids need opportunities to lead and succeed what have kids frank touched millions with her powerful account of the holocaust ruby bridges helped end segregation in the united states and most recently charlie simpson to raise one hundred and twenty thousand pounds for haiti on his little bike so as you can see evidenced by such examples age has absolutely nothing to do with it the traits the word childish addresses are seen so often in adults that we should abolish this age discriminatory word when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility say that certain types of irrational thinking exactly what the world needs maybe you've had grand plans before but stopped yourself thinking that's impossible or that costs too much or that won 't benefit me,1
7,AimeeMullins_1998.sph.wav,i stand in these legs my hamstring and my glutes are contracted as i would be had i had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet it's a company in san diego called flex foot and i was a guinea pig and as i hope to continue to be in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out but actually these like i said are still the actual prototype i need to get some new ones because the last so these are the sprint legs and i can put my other your mobility or you know even fashion i mean i love the fact that i can go in anywhere and pick out what i want and the shoes i want the skirts i want i'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people they're also silicon this is like a really basic basic prosthetic limb under here it's like a barbie i mean it's just stuck in this position so i have to wear a two inch heel and i mean it's really it you can see it but like it really is there's veins on the feet and then my heel 's like pink you know and my achilles tendon that moves a little bit and it's really an amazing sort you know that they do these track meets with all disabled runners and i figured oh i don't know about this but before i judge it let me go see what it's all about so i booked myself a flight to boston in ninety five a year and two weeks ago and this is just a silicon piece of skin i mean what happened was two years ago this man in belgium was saying you know god if i can go to madame tussauds wax museum and see we ha luckily the hotel was terrific they got these legs are great i'm doing i'm actually going back in a couple of weeks to get some improvements i want to get legs like these made for for me panting and heaving and i had these legs that were made of like a wood and plastic compound this and know what i was expecting but you know when i saw a man who was missing an entire leg go up to the high jump hop on one leg to the high jump and clear it at six feet two inches dan o 'brien jumped five eleven in ninety six in atlanta i mean if it just gives you a comparison of these are you know truly accomplished athletes without qualifying that word athlete and so i decided to give this a shot and don't have any skill or finesse going down that track you were all over the place we all saw how hard you were working and so i decided to call the track coach at georgetown and i thank god i didn't know just how huge this man is in the track and field world he 's coached thought we'd just talk a little bit and you know the man 's office is lined from floor to ceiling with all ran one race and i i wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete well we should meet first before we decide anything you know he 's thinking what am i getting myself into so i met these posters and magazine covers of people he 's coached and we sat and we got talking and it turned out to be a great partnership because he'd never coached a disabled athlete so therefore he had no on this trip so he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break his free time that i would come up to the track and train with him so that's how i met frank that was fall of ninety five and then by the winter rolling around he said you know you're good enough you can run on our women 's track team here and i said no come those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio it might have given it away i'm a double amputee why don't you tell them like on your way to the olympics but a couple of memorable events happened at georgetown why don't you just tell well you know i'd won everything as far as the disabled meets everything i competed in i was born without fibulas in both legs i was amputated at age one and i've been running like hell better than you and i went out there and made it to the big east which was sort of the championship race and really really hot and it's the first i had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio and i didn't realize at that time that you know the amount of sweating that i would be doing in the sock it actually acted like a lubricant and i'd be kind of pistoning in the socket and at about eighty five meters of my one hundred meters sprint in all my glory i came out of my leg like i almost came out of it in front of like five thousand people i i mean just mortified and because i was signed up for the two hundred a there's no way i'm going two hundred meters and he just sat there and you know my pleas fell on deaf ears thank god because he was like you know the man 's from brooklyn he 's a big i the two years you've been running am no a year cheryl a year and why don't you tell them what happened right before you go run your race am okay well atlanta the paralympics just for a little bit of clarification are the olympics for people with physical here we are like a week after the olympics and down at atlanta and i'm just blown away by the fact that you know a year ago i got out on a gravel track and couldn't run fifty meters and so here i am never lost i set new records at the u s nationals the olympic trials that may and was just you know sure that i was coming home with the gold i was also the only planar foot so we can't get off on the springboard i said well i just did it no one told me that so it's funny i'm three inches within the world record and kept on from that point you know so i'm signed up in the long jump signed up no i made it for the long jump and the one hundred meter and i'm sure of it you know i made the front page of my hometown paper that i delivered for six years you know it was like this is my time for i was the first person in the world on these legs i was the guinea pig and what kind of you know who 'm i running against here oh aimee we'll have to get back to you on that one i wanted to find out times don 't worry you 're you know you're doing great this is twenty minutes before my students out of the nation every year to get involved in international affairs and so i won a full ride to georgetown looking the next lane lane two is twelve point eight lane three is twelve point five which one of these is not like the other five golds when i skied and everything i came in first and georgetown you know that was great i was losing but it was the best training because this was atlanta oh my god my whole family you know got in a van and drove down here from pennsylvania and you know i was the only female u s sprinter so you know they call us out and you have one minute and when i was putting my blocks in my last card to play here is at least you know if i'm not going to beat these girls i'm going to and i've been there for four years love it the rocky iv sensation of me versus germany and you know everyone else estonia and poland was in this heat and you know the gun went off and you know finishing last and you know fighting back tears of frustration and aimee got there she decided that she 's kind of curious about track and field so she decided to call someone and start asking about it so why don't you tell i became a collegiate athlete you know i became an olympic athlete and it made me really think about how you know the achievement was getting there i mean the fact that i set my sight just a year and three months before that know and their patience you know to deal with me and that was like this collective glory that there was you know fifty people behind me that had joined in this incredible experience of going to atlanta so i mean it 's i apply this sort of philosophy now to everything i do about like this you know sitting back and realizing the progression like how far you've come at this day to this goal it's important to focus on a goal i think but you know also recognize the progression on the way there and how you've grown as a person you know that's the achievement i think that's the these are my cosmetic legs actually and they're absolutely beautiful to come up and see them there are hair follicles on them and i can paint my toenails and ewing who played for georgetown in the eighties comes back every summer and i had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room because he'd come in with he as i did anyway okay now these are my sprinting legs made of carbon graphite i said got different height am in these cheryl in these am i don't know i don't think really stand on these legs she has to be moving silicon sock and so i run on these and and i'd never competed on a disabled level you know i'd always competed against other able bodied athletes that's all i'd ever known in fact i'd never even met another amputee until i was seventeen and i heard,1
8,AimeeMullins_2009U.sph.wav,and other things that i don't aren't familiar with and then one eight year old said hey why wouldn't you want to and the whole room including me was like yeah i went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as disabled to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn't have yet somebody that might even be super abled speaking to a group of about three hundred kids ages six to eight at a children 's museum and i brought with me a bag full of legs similar to the kinds of things you see up here and had them laid out on a table some of you actually saw me at ted eleven years ago and a lot of talk about how life changing this conference is for both speakers and attendees and i am no exception ted literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life 's exploration at the time the legs i presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics i had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah which you may have seen on stage yesterday and also these very life like intrinsically painted silicone legs so at the time it was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community to come bring their talent to the science and to the art of building legs so that we can stop compartmentalizing form function and aesthetic and assigning them different values well lucky for me a lot of people answered that call and the journey started funny enough with a ted conference attendee chee pearlman who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today she was the editor then of a magazine called id and she gave me a cover story on the design of the cheetah legs around the world people would come up to me after the conference after my talk men and women and the conversation would go something like this you're very attractive you don't look disabled i thought well that's amazing because i don't feel and it really opened my eyes to this conversation that could be explored about beauty what does a beautiful woman have to look like sexy body and interestingly from an identity standpoint what does it mean to have a disability the kids and from my experience you know kids are naturally curious about what they don't know or don't understand or what is foreign to them i mean people pamela anderson has more prosthetic in her body than i do nobody calls her disabled so this magazine through the hands of graphic designer peter saville went to fashion designer alexander mcqueen and photographer nick knight who were also interested in exploring that conversation so three months after ted i found myself on a plane to london doing my first fashion shoot which resulted in this cover fashion able three months after that i did my first runway show for alexander mcqueen on a pair of hand carved wooden legs made from solid ash nobody knew everyone thought they were wooden boots actually i have them on stage with me into something that invites them to look and look a little longer and maybe even understand i learned this firsthand with my next adventure the artist matthew barney in his film opus called the the cremaster cycle only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way and maybe censors that natural curiosity or you know reins in the question asking in the hopes of them being polite little kids this is where it really hit home for me that my legs could be wearable sculpture and even at this point i started to move away from the need to replicate human ness as the only aesthetic ideal so we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs even though they're actually optically clear polyurethane a k a bowling ball material heavy then we made these legs that are with a potato root system growing in them and beetroots out the top and a very lovely brass toe that's a good close up of that one then another character was a half woman half cheetah a little homage to my life as an athlete that whipped around like a gecko and then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these look like jellyfish legs also polyurethane and the only purpose that these legs can serve outside the context of the film is to so whimsy legs that various people have made for me and with them i have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet and i can change my height i have a variable of five different heights and she looked at me and she said but so i just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby with these unruly kids saying now whatever you do don't stare at her legs but as you want it and that's when i knew that's when i knew that the conversation with society has changed profoundly in this last decade it is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency it's a conversation about limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore it can stand as a symbol that the wearer has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space so people that society once considered to be can now become the architects of their own identities and indeed continue to change those identities by designing their bodies from a place of empowerment and what is exciting to me so much right now is that by combining cutting edge technology robotics bionics with the age old poetry that if we want to discover the full potential in our humanity we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths and those glorious disabilities that we all have i think of shakespeare 's shylock that's the point that's why i was there i wanted to invite them to look and explore so i made a deal with the adults that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes on their own the doors open if you prick us do we not bleed and if you tickle us do we not laugh it is our humanity and all the potential within it that makes us beautiful thank you the kids descend on this table of legs and they are poking and prodding and they're wiggling toes and they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that and i said kids really quickly i woke up this morning i decided i wanted to be able to jump over a house dream up right now what kind of legs would you build me and immediately a voice,1
9,AlGore_2006.sph.wav,i looked in the rearview mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me there was no motorcade back there you've heard of phantom limb pain this was a rented ford taurus she took our order and then went to the couple in the booth next to us and she lowered her a series of the very next day but what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services the story began former vice president al gore announced in nigeria yesterday my wife tipper and i have opened a low cost family shoney 's and we are running it ourselves tipper was saying one more burger with fries talk about on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on what can you do about the climate crisis i want to start with show some new images and i'm going to recapitulate just four or five now the slide show i update the slide show every time i give it i add new images because i learn more about it every time i give it it's like beachcombing you know every time the tide comes in and out you find some more shells and i say that sincerely partly because just in the last two days we got the new temperature records in january this is just for the united states of america historical average for january is thirty one degrees last month was thirty nine point five degrees now i know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment but these are the recapitulation slides and then i'm going to go into new material about what you can do but i wanted to elaborate on a couple of these first of all this is where we're projected to go with the u s contribution to global warming under business as usual need that a cost it's a profit the sign is wrong it's not negative it's positive these are investments that pay for themselves but they are also very effective in deflecting our path cars and trucks i talked about that in the slideshow but i want you to put it in perspective it's an easy visible target of concern and it should be but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks cars and trucks are very significant and we have the lowest standards in the world and so we should address that but it's part of the puzzle other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks shows it carbon capture and sequestration that's what ccs stands for is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe not quite there yet ok now what can you do reduce emissions in your home most of these expenditures are also profitable a hybrid use light rail figure out some of the other options that are much better it's important be a green consumer you have choices with everything you buy between things that have a harsh effect or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis consider this make a decision to live a carbon neutral life those of you who are good at branding i'd love to get your advice and help i flew on air force two for eight years on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people it is easier than you think it really is a lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy reduce your carbon and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced and what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis net there is a carbon calculator now i have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane on this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a consumer friendly carbon calculator you can very precisely calculate what your co two emissions are and then you will be given options to reduce and by the time the movie comes out in may this will be updated to two point zero and we will have click through purchases of offsets next consider making your business carbon neutral again some of us have done that and it's not as hard as you think community invest sustainably majora mentioned this listen if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance don't ever again complain about quarterly report ceo it talk about it the movie comes out the movie is a movie version of the slideshow i gave two nights ago except it's a lot more and it comes out in may many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it consider sending somebody to nashville pick well and i am personally going to train people to give this slideshow re purposed with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach and it's not just the slides it's what they mean and it's how they link together and so i'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse in communities all across the country and we're what that's been like for me use copyrights so that young people can remix it we need republicans as well this used to be a bipartisan issue and i know that in this group it really is become politically active make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work it's a true story every bit of this is true support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions global warming pollution and trading as long as the united states is out of the world system it's not a closed system once it becomes a closed system it's a closed system soon after tipper and i left the you will have legal liability if you do not urge your ceo to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided the market will work to solve this problem if we can accomplish this and in our modern country the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once let 's rebrand global warming as many of you have suggested i like climate crisis instead of climate collapse but again those of you who are good at branding i need your help on this that's really true you very,1
10,AlGore_2008.sph.wav,heard a couple of days ago about the value of have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choice figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted by the amazing experience that she was going through we now have a culture of distraction but we have a planetary emergency and we have to find a way to create in the generation of those alive today a sense of generational mission i wish i could find the words to convey this this was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet another that ended slavery we can do this on our house and dug the geothermal wells and did all of that have the capacity at moments of great challenge to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge that history is presenting to us other stuff sometimes i hear people by saying oh this is so terrible what a burden we have i would like to ask you to re frame that but as important as it is to change the light bulbs it is more important to change the laws and when we had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts challenge that can pull from us more than we knew we could do i think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gratitude that we are the generation about which a thousand years from now and poets and singers will celebrate by saying they were the ones so many people at ted there is deep pain that basically a design issue at the end of the day a design issue on a voting form one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being heard like that in the last eight years in a position where you could make these things come true you have no idea when you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now i mean are you excited by their plans on global the answer to the question is hard for me because on the one hand i think that we should feel really great about the fact that the and forward leaning position on the climate crisis all three have offered leadership and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration in order and i think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals to be optimistic about this we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy in the campaign dialogue that as illustrated by the questions that was put together by the league of conservation voters by the way the analysis of all the questions and by the way the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the orwellian label clean coal every single debate has been sponsored by clean coal now even lower emissions the richness and fullness of the dialogue in our democracy has not laid the basis for the kind of bold that is really needed so they're saying the right things and they may whichever of them is elected may do the right thing but let me tell you only one out of one hundred senators was willing to vote to confirm to ratify that treaty whatever the candidates say has to be laid alongside what the people say this challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization co two is the exhaling breath of our civilization literally and now we mechanized that process changing that pattern requires a scope a scale a speed of change that is beyond what we have done in the past so that's why i began by saying be optimistic in what you do but be an active citizen demand change the light bulbs but change the laws change the global treaties we have to speak up we have to solve this democracy this we have sclerosis in our democracy and we have to change that use the internet go on the internet connect with people become very active as citizens have a moratorium we shouldn 't have any new we have to quickly build these renewable sources now nobody is talking on that scale but i do believe that between now and november it is possible this alliance for climate protection launch a nationwide campaign grassroots mobilization television ads internet ads radio newspaper with partnerships with everybody from the girl scouts to the hunters and fishermen we need help your own personal role going forward al is there something more than that you would like to be doing i have prayed that would be able to find the answer it does depend on all of us but again not just with the light bulbs most of us here are americans we have a democracy we can change things but we have to actively change i have given what's needed really is a higher level of consciousness and that's hard to that's hard to create but it is coming if you want to go far go together we have to go far thank you so much for coming to ted the slide show that i gave here two years ago about two thousand times i'm giving a short slide show this morning that i'm giving for the very first time many years ago when i was a young congressman i spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control the nuclear arms race and the military historians taught me during that quest that military conflicts are typically put into three categories local battles regional or theater wars and the rare but all important global world war a different organizational model environmental challenges fall into the same three categories and most of what we think about are local environmental problems air pollution water pollution hazardous waste dumps but there are also regional environmental problems like acid rain from the midwest to the northeast and from western europe to the arctic and not because venus is slightly closer to the sun it's three times hotter than mercury which is right next to the you've seen this slide before but there's a change the only two countries that didn't ratify and now there's only one,1
11,AlSeckel_2004.sph.wav,these are real objects now i'm going to show you how it is done i've looped the film here so you can get a very interesting experience i want you to see how this illusion is constructed and it's going to rotate so you see that it's inside out now watch as it rotates back how quickly your perception snaps talk my a new lecture just for ted and i'm going show you some illusions that we've created for ted and i'm going to try to relate this to happiness ok now watch it as it rotates back again and this is a very bright audience all right see if you can stop it from happening even though you know one hundred percent it's true that you we're going to do it again no doubt about see if you can stop it from happening it's difficult and we can violate your in a whole variety of ways about representation about shape about color and so forth and it's very primal and it's an interesting question to ponder why these things we find these things joyful why would we find them joyful so here 's something that lionel did a while ago i like these sort of little things like this i was thinking about with happiness is what gives happiness or happiness which i equate with joy in my particular area and i think there's something very fundamental and i was thinking about this ok we can violate your expectations about shape we can violate your expectations on representation what an image represents what do you see here see dolphins ok those people who raised their hands afterwards the rest of the audience go talk to them all right actually this is the best example of priming by experience that i know if you are a child under the age of ten who haven't been ruined yet look at this image and see dolphins now some of you adults here are saying dolphins what dolphins but in fact if you figure ground in other words the dark areas here i forgot to ask for a pointer but if you reverse it you'll see a whole series of little dolphins by the way it's something like this can be because this is after all talk about design this is done by saatchi and saatchi and they actually got away with this ad in australia so if you look at this ad for beer all those people are in sort of provocative positions but they got it past and actually won the clio awards so it is funny to do these things this is the joke i did when the the florida ballot was going around you know count the dots for gore count the dots for bush count them again and it's in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that you can violate your expectations about experience here is this is something we're building for you know amusement parks and that kind of stuff now let 's take a static image can you see this do you see the middle section moving down and the outer sections moving up it's completely static a static image how many people see it's completely static right now when it's interesting that when we look at an image we see you know color depth texture and you can look at this whole scene and analyze it you can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth but the whole thing is actually flat and it was such a good trompe l 'oeil that people got irritated when they tried to talk to the woman and she wouldn't respond now you can make design mistakes like this building in new york so that when you see it from this side it looks like the balconies tilt up and when you walk around to the other side it looks like the balconies go down so there are cases where you have mistakes in design that incorporate illusions or you take this particular un retouched now interestingly enough i get a lot of emails from people who say is there any perceptual difference between males and females and i really say no i mean women can navigate through the world just as well as males can and why however this is one illusion that women can consistently do better than males in matching which head because they rely on fashion cues they can match the now getting to a part i want to show design in illusions i believe that the first example of illusions being used purposely was by da vinci in this anamorphic image of so that when you saw from one little angle was like this and this little technique got popular in the sixteenth century and the seventeenth century to disguise hidden meanings where you could flip the image like this but these are early incorporations of illusions brought to sort of hot point with hans holbein 's ambassadors and hans holbein worked for henry this was hung on a wall where you could walk down from the stair and you can see this hidden skull right now i'm going to show you some designers who with illusions to give that element of surprise one of my favorites is scott kim i worked with scott to create some illusions for ted i hope you will enjoy we have one here ted and happiness so we scott created this wonderful well there's analog and digital figure goes to ground and for the musicians and of course since happiness we want joy to the world now another great designer he 's very well known in japan and he just builds some fantastic things this is simply amazing this is a pile of junk so what i'm going to try and do in my lecture is a go a little bit further and see that when you view it from one particular angle you see its reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano to violinist this is really wild this assemblage of forks knives and spoons and various cutlery welded together can violate your expectations in a pleasing way i mean sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant but i'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way in a very primal way so i can make the audience here happy a shadow of a motorcycle you learn something in the sort of thing that i do which is there are people out there with a lot of time on their hands ken knowlton does wonderful composite images like creating jacques cousteau out of seashells un retouched seashells but just by rearranging them he did einstein out of dice because after all einstein said god does not play dice with the universe out of un retouched keyboards will shortz crossword puzzle john cederquist does these wonderful trompe i'm going to skip ahead since i'm sort of running i want to show you quickly what i've created some new type of illusions i've done something with taking the pixar type illusions so you see these kids the same size here running down the hall the two table tops of the same size they're looking out two directions at once you have a larger piece fitting in with a smaller and that's something for you to think about all right so you see larger pieces fitting in within smaller pieces here you can see the two kids are looking out simultaneously out of two different directions at once now can you believe these two table tops are the same size and shape they are so if you measured them they would be as i say those two figures are identical in size and shape interesting by doing so i'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations first of all i want to show you the particular illusion here this in this sort of rendered fashion how much stronger these illusions are any case i hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness and if you're interested in seeing more cool effects see me outside i'd be happy to show you i want you first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other,1
12,AlaindeBotton_2009G.sph.wav,and uses that to come to a complete vision of who you are that is snobbery and the dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays job snobbery you encounter it within minutes at a party when you get asked that famous iconic question of the early twenty one st century what do you do and according to how you answer that question people are either incredibly delighted to see you or look at their watch and make their excuses now to opposite of a snob is your mother not necessarily your mother or indeed mine but as it were the ideal mother somebody who doesn't care about your achievements but unfortunately most people are not our mothers these career crises often actually on a sunday evening just as the sun is starting to set and the gap between my hopes for myself and the reality love in general respect they are willing to accord us that will be strictly defined by our position in the social hierarchy and that's a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers and indeed start caring so much about material goods you know we're often told that we live in very materialistic times greedy people i don't think we are particularly materialistic i think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods it's not the material goods we want it's the rewards we want and that's a new way of looking at luxury goods the next time you see somebody driving a ferrari don't think this is somebody who is greedy think this is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love feel sympathy rather than contempt there are other reasons there are other reasons why from many sources that anyone can achieve anything we've done away with the caste system we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please and it's a beautiful idea along with that is a kind of spirit of equality we're all basically equal there are no strictly defined kind of hierarchies there is one really big problem with this and that problem is envy envy of my life start to diverge so painfully that i normally end up weeping into a pillow i'm mentioning all this real taboo to mention envy but if there is one dominant emotion in modern society that is envy and it's linked to the spirit of equality let me explain i think it would be very unusual for anyone here or anyone watching to be envious of the queen of england even though she is much richer than any of you are and she's got a very large house the reason why we don't envy we can't relate to her and when you can't relate to somebody you don't envy them the closer two people are in age in background in the process of identification the more there is a danger of envy which is incidentally why none of you should ever go to a school reunion because there is no stronger reference point than people one was at school with but the problem generally of modern society is that it turns the whole world into a school everybody is wearing jeans everybody is the same and yet they're not so there is a spirit of equality combined with deep inequalities which makes for a very can make for a very stressful situation it's probably as unlikely that you would nowadays become as rich and famous as bill gates as it was unlikely in the seventeenth century that you would accede to the ranks of the french aristocracy but the point is it doesn't feel that way it's made to feel by magazines and other media outlets that if you've got energy a few bright ideas about technology a garage you i'm mentioning all this because i think this is not merely a personal problem you may think i'm wrong in this but i think that we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated by career crises by moments when what we thought we knew the first kind tells you you can do it you can make it anything is possible and the other kind tell you how to cope with what we politely call low self esteem or impolitely call feeling very bad about yourself a real correlationship a real correlation between a society that tells people that they can do anything and the existence of low self esteem so that's another way in which something that is quite positive can have a nasty kickback there is another reason why we might be feeling more anxious about our careers about our status in the world today than ever before and it is again linked to something nice and that nice thing is called meritocracy now everybody all politicians on left and right agree that meritocracy is a great thing and we should all be trying to make our societies really really meritocratic to get to the bottom also get to the bottom and stay there in other words your position in life comes to seem not accidental but merited and deserved and that makes failure seem much more crushing you know in the middle ages in england when you met a very poor person that person would be described as an unfortunate literally somebody who had not been blessed by fortune an unfortunate a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser and that shows four hundred years of evolution in society and about our lives about our careers comes into contact with a threatening sort of reality it's perhaps easier now than ever before our belief in who is responsible for our lives it's no longer the gods it's us we're in the driving seat that's exhilarating if you're doing well and very crushing if you're not it leads in the worst cases in the analysis of a sociologist like emil durkheim it leads to increased rates of suicide there are more suicides in developed individualistic countries than in any other part of the world and some of the reason for that is that people take what happens to them extremely personally the own their success but they also their failure is there any relief from some of these pressures that i've just been outlining i think there is i just want to turn to a few of them let 's take meritocracy this idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to i think it's a crazy idea completely crazy i will support any politician of left and right with any halfway decent meritocratic idea i am a meritocrat in that sense but i think it's insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic it's an impossible dream the idea that we will make a society where literally everybody the good at the top and the bad at the bottom and it's exactly done as it should be is impossible there are simply too many random factors accidents accidents of birth accidents of things dropping on people 's heads illnesses etc we will never get to grade them to make a good living it's perhaps harder than ever before to stay calm to be free of career anxiety i want to look in modern english that would mean it's a sin to come to any view of who you should talk to dependent on their business card it's not the post that should count and according to st augustine it's only god who can really put everybody in their place and he 's going to do that on the day of judgement with angels and trumpets and the skies will open insane idea if you're a secularist person like me but something very valuable in that idea nevertheless in other words hold your horses when you're coming to judge people you don't necessarily know what someone 's true value is that is an unknown part of them and we shouldn 't behave as though it is what we fear is the judgement and ridicule of others and it exists you know the number one organ of ridicule nowadays is the newspaper and if you open the newspaper any day of the week it's full of people who 've messed up their lives they've slept with the wrong person they've taken the wrong substance they've passed the wrong legislation whatever it is and then are fit for now if i may at some of the reasons why we might be feeling anxiety about our careers why we might be victims of these career crises as tragic art as it developed in the theaters of ancient greece in the fifth century b c was essentially an art form devoted to tracing how people fail and also according them a level of sympathy which ordinary life would not necessarily accord them i remember a few years ago i was thinking about all this and i went to see the sunday sport a tabloid newspaper that i don't recommend you to start reading if you're not familiar with it already i went to talk to them about certain of the great tragedies of western art and i wanted to see how they would seize the bare bones of certain stories if they came in as a news item at the news desk on a saturday afternoon so i told them about othello they had not heard of it but were fascinated by to write the headline for the story of othello they came up with love crazed immigrant kills senators daughter splashed i gave them the plotline of madame bovary again a book they were enchanted to discover and they wrote shopaholic adulteress swallows arsenic after credit then my favorite they really do have a kind of genius all of their own these guys my favorite is sophocles oedipus the king sex with mum was blinding like at one end of the spectrum of sympathy you've got the tabloid newspaper at the other end of the spectrum you've got tragedy and tragic art and i suppose i'm arguing that we should learn a little bit about what's happening in tragic art it would be insane to call hamlet a loser we're weeping softly into our pillows one of the reasons why we might be suffering is that we are surrounded by snobs he is not a loser though he has lost and i think that is the message of tragedy to us and why it's so very very important i think the other thing about modern society and why it causes this anxiety is that we have nothing at its center that is non human we are the first society to be living in a world where we don't worship anything other than ourselves we think very highly of ourselves and so we should we've put people on the moon of extraordinary things and so we tend to worship ourselves our heros are human that's a very new situation most other societies have had right at their center the worship of something transcendent a god a spirit a natural force the universe whatever it is something else that is being worshiped we've slightly lost the habit of doing that which is i think why we're particularly drawn to nature not for the sake of our health though it's often presented that way but because it's an escape from the human anthill it's an escape from our own competition and our own dramas and that's why we enjoy looking at glaciers and oceans and contemplating the from outside its perimeters etc we like to feel in contact with something that is non human and that is so deeply the screen who is very very successful certain ideas would immediately come to mind you would think that person might have made a lot of money achieved renown in some field my own theory of success and i'm somebody who is very interested in success i really want to be successful i'm always thinking how could i be more successful but as i get older i'm also very nuanced about what that word success might an insight that i've had about success you can't be successful at everything we hear a lot of talk about work life balance nonsense you can't have it all you so any vision of success has to admit what it's losing out on where the element of loss is and i think any wise life will accept as i say that there is going to be an element where we are not succeeding and the thing about a successful life is a lot of the time our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own they are sucked in from other people chiefly if you're a man your father and if you're a woman your mother when we're told that banking is a very respectable profession a lot of us want to go into banking when banking is no longer so respectable we lose interest in banking we are highly open to suggestion so what i want to argue for is not that we should give up on our ideas of success but we should make sure that they are our own we should focus in on our ideas and make sure that we own them that we are truly the authors of our own ambitions because it's bad enough not getting what you want even worse to have an idea of what it is you want and find out at the end of a journey that it isn 't in fact what you wanted all along so i'm going to end it there but what i really want to stress is by all means success yes but let 's accept the strangeness of some of our ideas let 's probe away at our notions of success let 's make sure our ideas of success are truly our own thank you very much that was fascinating how do you reconcile this idea of someone being it being bad to think of someone as a loser the idea that a lot of people like of seizing control of your life and that a society that encourages that perhaps has to have some winners and losers yes i think it's merely the randomness of the winning and losing process that i wanted to stress because the emphasis nowadays is so much on the justice of everything and politicians always talk about justice now i am a firm believer in justice i just think that it is impossible so we should do everything we can we should do everything we can to pursue it but at the end of the day we should always remember that whoever is facing us whatever has happened i mean do you believe that you can combine your kind of kinder gentler philosophy of work with a successful economy or do you think that you can 't but it doesn't matter too much that we're putting too much emphasis on the nightmare thought is that frightening people is the best way to get work out of them and that somehow the crueler the environment the more people will rise to the challenge you want to think who would you like as your ideal dad and your ideal dad is somebody who is tough but gentle and it's a very hard line to make we need fathers as it were the exemplary father figures in society,1
13,AlanKay_2007.sph.wav,to actually get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves so what i'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image about a fifth of a second later like that and they're getting faster and faster each time and if i stack these guys then we see the differences the increase in the speed is constant and they say oh yeah constant acceleration we've done that already and how shall we and verify that we actually the ball and run the movie at the same time very cleverly by running a ball down backwards down the strings of his lute i pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that this is actually this stuff works here gravity here 's this increase the speed by something increase the ship 's speed if i start the little game here that the kids have done it'll crash the but if i oppose gravity here we but in fact if you think of it children are the future we send to the future forget about messages children are the future the problem you have with this summer we're going to build five million of these one hundred dollar laptops and maybe fifty million next year but we that means that we once again have a thing where we can put technology out but the mentoring that is required to go from to draw is not that you can't move your hand but that the way your brain perceives images dollars so this is actually cheap and einstein said is faulty trying to perceive images into objects rather than seeing what's there and to prove it she says the exact size and shape of these tabletops is the same and i'm going to prove it to you she does this with cardboard but since i have an expensive computer here rotate this little guy around and now having seen that and i've seen it hundreds of times because i use this in every talk i give i still can't see that they're the same size and shape and i doubt that you can either great way to start i think measure very very carefully and if you measure very very carefully with a stiff arm a straight edge you'll see that those two shapes are exactly same size and the talmud saw this a long time ago saying we see things not as they are but as we are i certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that insight with my view of simplicity is to back then if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here it's a waking dream and understanding that that is what we actually exist in one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history and what that means simple and understandable might not be actually simple or understandable and things we think are complex might be made simple and understandable take a look at ted here you are understanding why we're here what's going on with no difficulty at all somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws we can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel the way i think of it is we can't learn to see until we admit we're blind finding ways to see things and little additional parts for our brain made out of powerful ideas that help us see the world in different ways and these are in the form of sensory apparatus most importantly in the ability to change perspective on things i'll talk about that a little bit it's this change in perspective and what it is we think we're perceiving that has helped us make more not taught in any k through twelve curriculum in america that i'm aware of one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more the best ai in the planet would find it complex and confusing and my little dog watson would find it simple and understandable but would miss the point and in fact we can keep on doing it for a very long time but murray gell mann yesterday talked about emergent properties another name for them could be architecture as a metaphor for taking the same old material and non obvious non simple ways of combining it what murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature of having the descriptions at various levels be rather similar all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles are both sticky and stand offish and they're in violent motion those three things give rise to all the different levels so when i saw the roslings in conveying complex ideas simply but then i had a thought of boy maybe it's too simple and i put some effort in to try and check to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side and i found that they matched up very well so the roslings have been able to do simplicity without removing what's important about the data whereas the film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell as a former molecular biologist i didn't like that at all not because it wasn't beautiful or anything but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology and that is why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed and what we saw yesterday was every reaction was fortuitous they just swooped in the air and bound and something have a great time and of course if you're a speaker those molecules are spinning at the rate of about a million revolutions per second agitating back and forth their size every two nanoseconds they're completely crowded together they're jammed they're bashing up against each other and if you don't understand that in your mental model of this stuff what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous and i think that's exactly the wrong image for when you're trying to teach science so another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication with the actual understanding of some principle so a kid who 's fourteen in high school this version of the like hans rosling direct one one that gives you more of the feeling of math is something closer to pythagoras own proof which goes like this so here we have this triangle and if we surround that a speaker finds this complex tricky but in hans rosling 's case he had a secret weapon yesterday literally c square with three more triangles and we copy that notice that we can that is all you have to do and this kind of proof is the kind of proof now let 's go to young children this is a very unusual teacher who was a kindergarten and first grade teacher but was a natural mathematician so she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music but is a terrific musician she just had a feeling for math and here are her six year olds and she's got them making shapes out of a shape and this teacher did on every project was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project and then something like science so they'd created these artifacts now she had them look at them in his sword swallowing act and i must say i thought of quite a few objects that i might try to swallow today and finally gave up and do this laborious which i thought for a long time until she explained to me was to slow them down so they'll think so they're cutting out the but the whole point of this thing is them to look at this chart and fill it out what have you noticed about what you did and so six year old lauren there noticed that the first one took one and the second one took three more and the total was four on that one the third one took five more and the total was nine on that one and then the next one so she saw right away that the additional tiles that you had to add around the edges was always going to grow by two so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there and she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six so that's what lauren did and then the teacher gillian ishijima had the kids bring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor and everybody went batshit no matter what the shapes were the growth law is the same and the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progressions as a first order discrete differential equation and a second order discrete he just did it and that was by six year olds so let 's take a look now how we might use the computer for some of this wonderful thing so puck meant and so the first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children do i'm using the software that we're putting on the one hundred dollar laptop so i'd like to draw a little not only are we fools in the pejorative sense but that we're easily fooled in fact what shakespeare was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled so we're actually looking forward to it and here 's a little behavior car forward each time i click it car turn if i want to make a little script to do this over and over again i just drag these guys out goes straight that's a bit of a revelation for nine year olds a little bit like kissing your sister as far as driving a car so the kids want to do a steering wheel so they draw a steering wheel we'll there and to just drop it into the script here and now i can steer the car with the steering wheel we get a visual pattern of what these nine year olds called acceleration so how did the children do science to the we go to magic shows in order to be fooled not and this makes many things fun but it makes it difficult because of course he didn't bother doing the experiment and neither did st thomas aquinas and it was not until galileo actually did it that an adult thought like a child only four hundred years ago we get one child like that about every classroom of thirty kids will actually cut straight to the chase now what if we want to look at this more closely we can take a movie of what's going on but even if we single stepped this movie it's tricky to see what's going on and so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side or stack them up so when the children see this they say ah acceleration,1
14,AlanRussell_2006.sph.wav,and that bio reactor will lay down in the wound bed the gun that you see there sprays cells that's going to spray cells over that area the reactor will serve to fertilize the environment deliver other things as well at the same time and therefore we will that lawn as opposed to try the sodding approach it's a completely different way of doing it so my eighteen minutes is up so let me finish up with some good news and maybe a little bit of bad news the good news is that this is happening today it's very powerful work clearly the images kind of get that across it's incredibly difficult because it's highly inter disciplinary this is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine this is not regenerative medicine regenerative medicine is what business week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago the idea a number of governments and a number of regions have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease the japanese government were perhaps the first when they decided to invest first three billion european union same thing china the same thing china just launched a national tissue engineering center the first year budget was two hundred and fifty million us dollars in the united states we've had a somewhat different approach we and be in the real world as president we've had a different approach and the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along but there's been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way and i'm going to finish up with a quote maybe a little cheap shot at the director of the nih who 's a very charming man to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that twenty seven point five billion dollars get next year and focus it in a strategic way to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients and at the end of a very testy meeting what the nih director said is your vision is larger than our appetite i'd like to close by saying that no one 's going to change our vision but together we can change his appetite thank is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like and i'll come back to that theme a few times instead of doing that we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue so that at the end of the treatment you are the same as you were at the beginning of the you today about hopefully converting fear into hope when we go to the physician this is a good idea very few good ideas are truly novel and this is just the same if you look back in history charles lindbergh who was better known for flying airplanes was actually one of the first people along with alexis carrel one of the nobel laureates from rockefeller we've come a long way since then i'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on but before doing that what i'd like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life and reducing poverty and essentially today when we go to the doctor 's office and we walk in there are words that we just don't want to hear there are words that we're truly afraid and you can basically see that the richer a country is the older the people are within it why is this important and why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now if the average age of your population is thirty then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken ankle every now and again maybe a little bit of if the average age in your country is forty five to fifty five now the average person is looking at diabetes early onset diabetes heart failure coronary artery disease workers per retiree forty one people who were basically outside of being really sick paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease in two thousand and ten two workers per retiree in the u s and this is matched in every industrialized wealthy country in the world how can you actually afford to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this this is age versus cost of health care and you can see that right around age forty five forty to forty five there's a sudden spike in the cost of health care it's actually quite interesting if you do the right studies you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care plotted over your lifetime and about seven years before you're about to die there's a spike and you can actually we won 't get into that there are very few things very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what i would call healthy aging i'd suggest there are four things and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system all those things do is change who pays they don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment one thing you can do is not treat you can ration health care we won 't talk about that anymore it's too depressing you can prevent obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention but perhaps most interesting to me anyway and most important is the idea of diagnosing a and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom think of it in terms of ten twenty thirty forty years and we do ok insulin 's a pretty good therapy but eventually it stops working and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease why couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease perhaps even before it was symptomatic and it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it but if it worked we would truly be able to do something different this video i think gets across the concept that i'm talking about quite dramatically this is a newt re growing its limb if a newt can do this kind of thing why can't we i'll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment what i want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease why it's important why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if you think it already but what we're talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body tissues and for organs themselves so today 's reality is that if we get sick the message is we will treat your symptoms and you need to adjust to a new way of life i would pose to you that tomorrow and when tomorrow is we could debate but it's within the foreseeable future we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation a limb prosthetic up here similar actually to the one that the soldier that's come back from iraq there are three hundred and seventy soldiers that have come back from iraq that have lost limbs imagine if instead of facing that they could actually face the regeneration of that limb it's a wild concept i'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept but it's applicable again to every organ system how can we do that the way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body we need to learn to speak the body 's language and to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus a mammalian fetus if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy will re grow that so our dna has the capacity to do these kinds of wound healing mechanisms it's a natural process but it is lost as we age in a child so to engage in that conversation with the body we need to speak the body 's language and there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today i'm going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body the first is cellular therapies clearly we heal ourselves in a natural process using cells to do most of the work therefore if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body they may do the healing and where we are clinically today and where we might go tomorrow and what some of the hurdles are and we're going to do all of that in eighteen minutes then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself and finally we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to if you threw away all the cells and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself and he asked a very important question he asked the question if i take that material which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine and i place it somewhere else on a person 's body would it give a tissue specific response or would it make small intestine if i tried to make a new ear i wouldn't be telling you this story if it wasn't compelling the picture i'm about to show you is a compelling picture however for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends the lights are down this is a good time to look at your feet check your blackberry do anything other than look at the screen what i'm about to show you i want to start with this slide because this slide sort of tells the story the way science magazine thinks of it this was an issue from two thousand and two is a diabetic ulcer and although it's good to laugh before we look at this this is the reality of diabetes i think a lot of times we hear about diabetics diabetic ulcers we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment which is amputation if you can't heal it so i'm going to put the slide up now it won 't be up for long this is a diabetic ulcer it's tragic the treatment for this is amputation this is an older lady she has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes and has decided to die with what s left of her body intact and this lady decided after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer that she would try this new therapy that steve invented that's what the wound looked like eleven weeks later that material contained only natural signals and that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn't have before there's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you i'll let you know when you can look again this is a horse the horse is not in pain if the horse was in pain i wouldn't show you this slide the horse just has another nostril that's developed because of a riding accident just a few weeks after treatment in this case taking that material turning it into a gel that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human it was basically a regenerative medicine issue regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple and packing that area and then repeating the treatment a few times and the horse heals up and if you took an ultrasound of that area it would look great a dolphin where the fin 's been re attached there are now four hundred thousand patients around the world who have used that material to heal their could you regenerate a limb darpa just gave steve fifteen million dollars to lead an eight institution project to begin the process of asking that question and i'll show you the fifteen million dollar picture this is a seventy eight year old man who 's lost the end of his fingertip remember that i mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips after treatment that's what it looks like this is happening today this is clinically relevant today there are materials which do this there are the heart patches but could you go a little further could you say instead of using material can i take some cells along with the material and remove a damaged piece of tissue put a bio degradable material on there you can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish this was done by now i'm going to show you cell based to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient again if you're squeamish you don't want to watch but this one 's kind of cool this is a bypass operation just like what al gore had with a in this case at the end of the bypass operation you're going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient and i'm standing up here because at one point i'm going to show you that everybody can understand it's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant just how early this technology is here go the stem cells right into the beating heart of the patient and if you look really carefully it's going to be right around this point you'll actually see a back flush you see the cells coming back out we need all sorts of new technology new devices to get the cells to the right place at the right time just a little bit of data a tiny bit of data this was a randomized trial at this time this was an n of twenty now there's an n of about one hundred these are now two years out the coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state this is the same procedure but now done minimally invasively with only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure there go the cells we don't have time to go into all of those details but basically that works too you can take patients who are less sick and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state through that kind of therapy here 's another example of stem cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet but i think very soon will be so we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there we know that if we have a damaged hip you can put an artificial hip in and this is the idea that science magazine used on their front cover it's a great source of stem cells stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid so you could go in you could get your tummy tuck out comes the liposuction fluid and in this case the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons all done in the lab and i think fairly soon you will see patients being treated with their own fat derived or adipose derived stem cells i talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease here 's just one example before i close up this is equally tragic we very abiding and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the institute for surgical research in the us army who have to treat the now eleven thousand kids that have come back from iraq many of those patients are very severely burned and if there's anything that's been learned about burn it's that we don't know how to treat it everything that is done to treat burn basically we do a sodding approach we make something over here and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound and we try and get the two to take in this case here a new wearable bio reactor has been designed it should be tested clinically later this year at isr by joerg gerlach in pittsburgh,1
15,AlanSiegel_2010.sph.wav,i went one step further and said why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document let 's go online people might need help in computation working with the harvard business school you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment if you spent sixty two dollars for a meal the longer you take to pay out that loan you see over a period of time using the minimum payment it's ninety nine dollars and seventeen cents how about that do you think your bank is going to show that to people but it's going to work it's more effective than just computational aids and what about terms like over the limit perhaps a stealth thing define it in context tell people what it means when you put it in plain english changing the content and one of the things i'm most proud of is this agreement for ibm it's a grid it's so basically we have public leaders public officials who are out of control they are writing bills that are unintelligible and out of these bills are going to come maybe forty thousand pages of regulations total complexity at such and such a date ibm has responsibilities you have responsibilities received very favorably by business running through this typical letter that they had i ran it through my simplicity lab it's pretty unintelligible all the the document in red are not intelligible we looked at doing over one thousand letters that cover seventy percent of irs transactions in plain english they have been tested in the laboratory when i run it through my lab this heat mapping shows everything that is intelligible and the irs has introduced the program are a couple of things going on right now that i want to bring to your attention there is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency and how to mandate simplicity we see all this complexity no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate there is no way we should do business with companies that so how are we going to change the world make clarity transparency and simplicity a national priority which has a dramatically negative impact on our life if you're a veteran coming back from iraq or vietnam you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits if you're trying to get a small business loan you face a blizzard of paperwork what are we going to do about it i define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity transparency and empathy building humanity into communications i've been simplifying things for thirty years i come out of the advertising and design business my focus is understanding you people and how you interact with the government to get your benefits how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with and how you view brands so very quickly when president obama said i don't see why we can't have a one page plain english consumer credit agreement so i locked myself in a room figured out the content,1
16,AlexTabarrok_2009.sph.wav,i don't have to tell you the internet have come tumbling down and of course the iron curtains have come tumbling down now all of this has been tremendous for the world and perhaps most remarkably at the beginning of the twenty first century really for the first time in modern history growth extended to almost all parts of the world never before in human history have so many people been raised out of such great poverty as happened in china china is the world 's greatest anti poverty program over the last three decades africa has been the area of the world most resistant to growth and we can see the tragedy of africa in the first few bars here growth was negative we saw growth in africa and i think as you'll see there's reasons for optimism because i believe that the best is yet to come now why on the cutting edge today it's new ideas which are driving growth and by that i mean it's products for which the research and development costs are really high and the manufacturing costs are low the first world war more than ever before it is these types of ideas which are driving growth on the cutting edge now ideas have this amazing property the great depression the second world war and the rise of the communist nations as he who lights his candle at mine receives light without darkening me or to put it slightly differently one apple feeds one man but an idea can feed the world now this is not new this is practically not new to tedsters this is practically the model of ted what is new is that the greater function of ideas is going to drive growth even more than ever before this provides a reason why trade and globalization are even more important more powerful than ever before and are going to increase growth more than ever before and to explain why this is so i have a question suppose that there are two diseases one of them is rare the other one is common but if they are not treated they are equally severe if you had to choose which would you rather have the common disease or the rare disease common the common i think that's absolutely right why because there are more drugs to treat common diseases than there are to treat rare diseases the reason for this is incentives and each one of these forces split the world tore the world apart divided the world and they threw up walls it costs about the same to produce a new drug whether that drug treats one thousand people one hundred thousand people or a million people but the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people so the incentives are much larger to produce drugs which treat more people to put this differently larger markets save lives think about the following if china and india were as rich as the united states is today the market for cancer drugs would be eight times larger than it is now now we are not there yet but it is happening as other countries become richer the demand for these pharmaceuticals is going to increase tremendously and that means an increase incentive to do research and development which benefits everyone in the world action movies have larger budgets than comedies it's because action movies translate easier into other languages and other cultures so the market for those movies is larger people are willing to invest more and the budgets are larger alright well if larger markets increase the incentive to produce new ideas how do we maximize that incentive having one world market by globalizing the world the way i like to put this is one idea ideas are meant to be shared so one idea can serve one world one market political walls trade walls transportation walls communication walls iron curtains which divided peoples one idea one world one market can we create new ideas that's one reason trade how else can we create new ideas well more idea creators idea creators they come from all walks of life artists and innovators many of the people you've seen on this stage i'm going to focus on scientists and engineers because i have some data on that and i'm a data person now today less than one of one percent of the world 's population are scientists and engineers the u s is losing its idea leadership and for that i am very grateful that is a good thing it is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader because for too long the united states and a handful of other developed countries have shouldered the entire burden of research and development but consider the following if the world as a whole were as wealthy as the united states is now there would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers contributing ideas which benefit everyone which are shared by everyone i think of the great indian mathematician and nations it was only in the second half of the twentieth century that we slowly began to pull ourselves out of this abyss how many ramanujans are there in india today toiling in the fields barely able to feed themselves when they could be feeding the world now we're not there yet but it is going to happen in this century the real tragedy of the last century is this if you think about the world 's population as a giant computer a massively parallel processor then the great tragedy has been that billions of our processors have been off but in this century china is coming on line india is coming on line is coming on line we will see an einstein in africa in this century think what this means this means we all benefit when another country gets rich need a greater demand for ideas those larger markets i was talking about earlier and a greater supply of ideas for the world now you can see some of the reasons why i'm optimistic century than you expect to see in a year today trade walls began to come tumbling down here are some data on tariffs starting at forty percent coming down to less than five percent we globalized the world average gdp per capita in the world will be two hundred thousand dollars that's not u s gdp per capita which will be over a million but world gdp per capita two hundred thousand dollars that's not that far we won 't make it but some of our grandchildren probably will and i should say i think this is a rather modest prediction in kurzweilian terms this is gloomy growth alright what about problems what about a great depression well let 's take a look let 's take a look at the great depression we went off a cliff but we recovered in fact in the second half of the twentieth century growth was even higher than anything you would have predicted upon the first half of the twentieth century so growth can wash away even what appears to be a great depression that mean it means that we extended cooperation across national boundaries we made the world more alright what else oil oil this was a big topic when i was writing up my notes oil was one hundred and forty dollars per barrel so people were asking a question the were saying is china drinking our milkshake and there is some truth to this in the sense that we have something of a finite resource and moreover as everyone knows look it's energy not oil which counts and higher oil to overcome an increase in the price of oil today than ever in the past because of what i'm talking about one idea one world one market so i'm optimistic so long as we hew to these two ideas to keep globalizing world markets keep extending cooperation across national boundaries and keep investing in education now the united states has a particularly important role to play in this to keep our education system globalized to keep our education system open to students from all over the world because our education system is the candle that other students come to to light their own candles now remember here what jefferson said jefferson said when they come and light their candles at ours that they gain light and we are not darkened because the truth is so my view is be optimistic spread the ideas spread the light thank you today a container ship can carry one hundred and fifty thousand tons it can be manned with a smaller crew and unloaded faster than ever before,1
17,AlexisOhanian_2009I.sph.wav,to seventy percent at the end of voting which is pretty impressive right we won mister splashy pants was chosen hmm just kidding okay so greenpeace actually wasn't that crazy about it because they wanted one of their more thoughtful names to win so they said no no just kidding we'll give it another week of voting well that got us a little angry so we changed it to fightin splashy community really and the rest of the internet rather really got behind this facebook groups were getting created facebook applications were getting created the idea was vote your conscience vote for mister splashy pants and people were putting up signs in the real world about this whale is obvious it's a great name everyone wants to hear their news anchor say mister splashy pants and i think that's what helped drive this but what was cool was the repercussions now for greenpeace was they created an entire marketing campaign around it they sell mister splashy pants shirts and pins they even created an e card so you could send your friend a dancing splashy was even more important was the fact that they actually accomplished their mission the japanese government called off their whaling expedition mission accomplished greenpeace was thrilled the whales were happy that's a quote this wasn't really out of altruism this was just out of interest in doing something cool and this is kind of how the internet works this is that great big secret and one of the great lessons that greenpeace actually learned was that it's okay to lose control it's okay to take yourself a little less seriously given that even though it's a very serious cause you could ultimately achieve your final goal and that's the final message that i want to share with all of you that you can do well online but no longer is the message going to be coming from just the top down if you want to succeed you've got to be okay to just lose control thank you is actually about discovering new things that pop up on the web because in the last four years we've seen all kinds of memes all kinds of trends get born right on our front page on their whaling campaign these humpback whales were getting killed they wanted to put an end to it and one of the ways they wanted to do it was to put a tracking chip inside one of these humpback whales i believe this is a farsi word for immortal i think this means divine power of the ocean in a polynesian language and then there was this mister splashy pants and this this was special mister pants or splashy to his friends was very popular on the internet in fact someone on reddit thought oh what a great thing we should all vote this up and you know,1
18,AliCarrChellman_2010X.sph.wav,for every one hundred girls with an emotional disturbance diagnosed we have three hundred and twenty four boys and by the way all of these numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black you happen to exist in an overcrowded school and if you are a four times as likely to be diagnosed with adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder now there is another side to this and it is important that we recognize that women still need help in school that salaries are still significantly lower even when controlled for job types and that girls have continued to struggle in math and science for years that's all true nothing about that prevents us from paying attention to the literacy needs of our boys between ages three and thirteen and so we should in fact what we ought to do is take a page from their playbook because the initiatives and programs that have been set in place for women in science and engineering and mathematics are fantastic they've done a lot of good for girls in these situations so i'm here to tell you that we have a problem with boys and we ought to be thinking about how we can make that happen for boys too in their younger years we may be getting close to seventy percent female population in universities this makes university administrators very nervous because girls don't want to go to schools that don't have boys and it's a serious problem with boys we're starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university if you talk to faculty they may say well they're playing video games and they're gambling online all night long and they're playing world of warcraft and that's affecting their academic their culture isn't working in schools and i'm going to share with you ways that we can think about overcoming that problem guess what video games are not the cause video games are a symptom they were turned off a long time before they got here so let 's talk about why they got turned off when they were between the ages of three and thirteen there are three reasons that i believe that boys are out of sync with the culture of schools today and when he did she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns you can't have plastic knives and swords and axes and all in a kindergarten classroom what is it that we're afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun i mean really but here he stands as testament to the fact that you can't roughhouse on the playground today now i'm not advocating for bullies i'm not suggesting that we need to be allowing guns and knives into school but when we say that an eagle scout in a high school classroom to start by saying this is a to write poems and little moments in my life i don't want to write that stuff and this is a girl and this is probably stereotypically what you think of as a boy and a girl if i essentialize gender for you today then you can dismiss what i have to say so i'm not going to do that i'm not interested in doing that well what do you want to write what do you want to write about i want to write about video games i want to write about leveling up i want to write about this really interesting world i want to write about the answer is no he 's just a boy he 's just a little boy it's not okay to write these kinds of things in classrooms today there are fewer male teachers anybody who 's over fifteen doesn't know what this means because in the last ten years the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half now what's the problem with this women are great yep absolutely but male role models for boys that say it's all right to be smart they've got dads they've got pastors they've got cub scout leaders but ultimately six hours a day five days a week they're spending in a classroom and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist and so they say i guess this really isn't a place for boys teachers lounge and they're having a conversation about this is a different kind of boy and a different kind of girl so the point here is that not all boys exist within these rigid boundaries of what we think of as boys and girls you'll see the conversation changes depending upon who 's sitting around the table third reason that boys are out of sync with school today kindergarten is the old second grade folks we have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there in first grade you should be able to read paragraphs of with maybe a picture maybe not in a book of maybe twenty five to thirty pages if you don 't we're probably going to be putting you into a title one special reading program and if you ask title one teachers they'll tell you they've got about four or five boys for every girl that's in their program in the elementary grades is because the message that boys are getting is you need to do what the teacher asks you to do all the time the teacher 's salary depends on no child left behind and race to the top and accountability and testing and all of this so she has to figure out a way and so this is a very serious problem where is it coming from it's coming from we want to live in lake wobegon where every child is above average but what this does to our children is really not healthy it's not developmentally appropriate and it's particularly bad for boys need to meet them where they are we need to put ourselves into boy culture we need to change the mindset of acceptance in boys in elementary schools very specific things we can design better games most of the educational games that are out there are really flashcards they're glorified drill and practice they don't have the depth the rich narrative that really engaging video games have that the boys are really interested in so we need to design better games all of those conversations need to be happening there are some great examples out there of schools the new york times just talked about a school recently a game designer from the new school put together a wonderful video gaming school it only treats a few kids and so this isn't very scalable we have to change the culture and the feelings that politicians and school board members and parents have about the way we accept and what we accept in our schools today we have to find more money for game design because good games really good games cost money and world of warcraft has quite a budget most of the educational games do not the point is that for boys the way that they exist and the culture that they embrace isn't working well in schools now how do we know that and we discovered that they talk about the kids in their school who talk about gaming in pretty demeaning ways they say oh yeah they're always talking about that stuff they're talking about their little action figures and their little nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tolerance policies they are sure that parents and administrators will never accept anything so we really need to think about looking at teacher attitudes and finding ways to change the attitudes so that teachers are much more open and accepting of boy cultures in their classrooms because ultimately if we don have boys who leave elementary school saying you the one hundred girls project tells us some really nice statistics for example for every one hundred girls that are suspended from school there are two hundred and fifty boys that are suspended from school for every one hundred girls who are expelled from school there are three hundred and thirty five boys who are expelled from school for every one hundred girls in special education there are two hundred and seventeen boys for every one hundred girls with a learning disability there are two hundred and seventy six boys,1

21,AndersYnnerman_2010X.sph.wav,we're seeing this it's beginning a technology trend that's happening right now is that we're starting to look at time result situations as well so we're getting the dynamics out of the body as well and just assume that we will be collecting data during five seconds and that would correspond to one terabyte of data that's eight hundred thousand books and sixteen km of phone books that's one patient one data set and this is what we have to deal with so this is really the enormous challenge that we have and already today this is twenty five thousand images imagine the days when we had radiologists doing this they would put up twenty five thousand images they would go like this twenty five zero okay okay there is the problem they can't do that anymore that's impossible so we have to do something that's a little bit more intelligent than doing this so what we do is we put all these slices together imagine that you slice your body in all these directions and then you try to put the slices back together again into a pile of data into a block of data start by posing a little bit of a challenge the challenge of dealing with data data that we have to deal with in medical so this is really what we're doing so this gigabyte or terabyte of data we're putting it into this block but of course the block of data just contains the amount of x ray that's been absorbed in each point in the human body so what we need to do is to figure out a way of looking at the things we do want to look at and make things transparent that we don't want to look at so transforming the data set into something that looks like this and this is a challenge this is a huge challenge for us to do that using computers even though they're getting faster and better all the time it's a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data terabytes of data and extracting the relevant information i want to look at the heart i want to look at the blood vessels i want to look at the liver maybe even find a tumor in some cases so this is where this little dear comes into play this is my daughter this is as of nine zero am this morning she's playing a computer game she's only two years old and she's having a blast so she's really the driving force behind the development of graphics processing units as long as kids are playing computer games graphics is getting better and better and better so please go back home tell your kids to play more games because that's what i need so what's inside of this machine is what enables me to do the things that i'm doing with the medical data so really what i'm doing is using these fantastic little devices and you know going back maybe ten years in time when i got the funding to buy my first graphics computer it was a huge machine it was cabinets of processors and storage and everything i paid about one million dollars for that machine that machine is today about as fast as my so every month there are new graphics cards coming out and here is a few of the latest ones from the vendors nvidia ati intel is out there as well and you know for a few hundred bucks you can get these what we can do this is a data set that was captured using a ct scanner you can see that this is a full data it's a woman you can see the hair you can see the individual structures of the woman you can see that there is scattering of x rays on the teeth the metal in the teeth that's where those artifacts are coming from but fully interactively on standard graphics cards on a normal computer i can just put in a clip plane and of course all the data is inside so i can start rotating i can look at it from different angles and i can see that this woman had a problem she had a bleeding up in the brain and that's been fixed with a little stent a metal clamp that's tightening up the vessel it's a fantastic device it uses x rays x ray beams that are rotating very fast around the human body it takes about thirty seconds to go through the whole machine and just by changing the functions then i can decide what's going to be transparent and what's going to be visible i can look at the skull structure and i can see that okay this is where they opened up the skull on this woman and that's where they went in so these are fantastic images they're really high resolution and they're really showing us what we can do with standard graphics cards today now we have really made use of this and we have tried to squeeze a lot of data into the system and one of the applications that we've been working on and this is gotten a little bit of traction worldwide is the application of virtual autopsies so again looking at very very large and you saw those full body scans that we can do we're just pushing the body through the whole ct scanner and just in a few seconds we can get a full body data set so this is from a virtual and you can see how i'm gradually peeling off first you saw the body bag that the body came in then i'm peeling off the skin you can see the muscles and eventually you can see the bone structure of this woman now at this point i would also like to emphasize that with the greatest respect for the people that i'm now going to show i'm going to show you a few cases of so it's with great respect for the people that have died under violent circumstances that i'm showing these pictures to you in the forensic case and this is something that there's been approximately four hundred cases so far just in the part of sweden that i come from that has been undergoing virtual autopsies in the past four years so this will be the typical work flow situation the police will decide in the evening when there's a case coming in they will decide okay is this a case where we need to do an autopsy so in the morning and is generating enormous amounts of information that comes out of the machine so this is a fantastic machine that we can use for improving health care seven in the morning the body is then transported inside the body bag to our center and is being scanned through one the the ct scanners and then the radiologist together with the pathologist and sometimes the forensic scientist looks at the data that's coming out and they have a joint session and then they decide what to do in the real physical now looking at a few cases here 's one of the first cases that we had you can really see the details of the data set it's very high resolution and it's our algorithms that allow us to zoom in on all the details and again it's fully interactive so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here without saying too much about this case this is a traffic accident a drunk driver hit a woman here 's another case a knifing and this is also again showing us what we can do it's very easy to look at metal artifacts that we can show inside of the body you can also see some of the artifacts from the teeth that's actually the filling of the teeth but because i've set the functions to show me metal and make everything else transparent but as i said it's also a challenge for us and the challenge is really found in this picture here it's the medical data explosion that we're having right now it's very easy to see how air has been leaking from one part to another part which is difficult to do in a normal standard physical autopsy so it really really helps the one of the things that i'm really really happy to be able to show you here today is our virtual autopsy table it's a touch device that we have developed based on these algorithms using standard graphics gpu 's it actually looks like this just to give you a feeling for what it looks like it really just works like a huge so we've implemented all the gestures you can do on the table and you can think of it as an enormous touch interface so if you were thinking of buying an ipad forget about it this is what you want instead steve i hope you're listening to this so it's a very nice little device so if you have the opportunity please try it out it's really a hands on experience so it's gained some traction and we're trying to roll this out and trying to use it for educational purposes but also perhaps in the future in a more clinical situation there's a youtube that you can download and look at this if you want to convey the information to other people about virtual okay now that we're talking about touch let me move on to really touching data and this is a bit of science fiction now so we're moving into really the future this is not really what the medical doctors are using right now but i hope they will in the future so what you're seeing on the left is a touch device it's a little mechanical pen that has very very fast step motors inside of the and so i can generate a force feedback so when i virtually touch data it will generate touch forces in the pen so i get a feedback so in this particular situation it's a scan of a living person i have this pen and i look at the data and i move the pen towards the head and all of a sudden i feel resistance so i can feel the skin if i push a little bit harder i'll go through the skin and i can feel the bone structure inside if i push even harder i'll go through the bone structure especially close to the ear where the bone is very soft and then i can feel the brain inside and this so this is really nice and to take that even further this is a heart and this is also due to these fantastic new scanners that just in zero point three seconds i can scan the whole heart and i can do that with time resolution so just looking at this heart i can play back a video here and this is karljohan one of my graduate students who 's been working on this project and he 's sitting there in front of the haptic device the force feedback system and he 's moving his pen towards the heart and the heart is now beating in front of him so he can see how the heart is beating he 's taken the pen and he 's moving it towards the heart and he 's putting it on the heart and then he feels the heartbeats from the real living patient then he can examine how the heart is moving he can go inside push inside of the heart and really feel how the valves are moving go inside of the patient 's heart before you actually do surgery and do that with high quality resolution data so this is really neat we're going even further into science fiction and we heard a little bit about functional mri now this is really an interesting project is using magnetic fields and radio frequencies to scan the brain or any part of the body so what we're really getting out of this is information the structure of the brain but we can also measure the difference in magnetic properties of blood that's oxygenated and blood that's depleted of oxygen that means that it's possible to map out the activity of the brain taken the liberty just for clarity to translate that to data slices that would correspond to about fifty mb of data which is small so this is something that we've been working on and you just saw motts the research engineer there going into the mri system and he was wearing goggles so he could actually see things in the goggles so i could present things to him in the scanner and this is a little bit freaky because what motts is seeing is actually this he 's seeing his own brain so motts is doing something here and probably he is going like this with his right hand because the left side is activated on the motor cortex and then he can see that at the same time these visualizations are brand new and this is something that we've been researching for a little while this is another sequence of motts brain and here we asked motts to calculate backwards from one hundred so he 's going one hundred ninety seven ninety four and then he 's going backwards and you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain and is lighting up the whole brain well this is fantastic we can do this in real time we can investigate things we can tell him to do things you can also see that his visual cortex is activated in the back of the head and in just a second here you will see okay here motts now move your left foot so he 's going like this for twenty seconds he 's going like that and all of a sudden it lights up up here so we've got motor cortex activation up so this is really really nice and i think this is a great tool and connecting also with the previous talk here this is something that we could use as a tool to really understand how the neurons are working how the brain is working and we can do this with very very high visual quality and very fast resolution you think about the data we can handle today just on normal mobile devices if you translate that to phone books it's about one meter of phone books in the now we're also having a bit of fun at the center so this is a cat scan computer aided tomography so this is a lion from the local zoo outside of norrkoping in kolmarden elsa so she came to the center and we've been experimenting with this and i think this is a great application for the future of this technology because there's very little known about the animal anatomy so with that i'd like to thank all the people that have helped me to generate these images it's a huge effort that goes into doing this gathering the data and developing the algorithms writing all the software so some very talented people my motto is always i only hire people that are smarter than i am and most of these are smarter than i am so thank you very much,1
22,AndrewMwenda_2007G.sph.wav,i want to say that there are two things we need to connect how the media covers africa in the west and the consequences of that by displaying despair helplessness and hopelessness the media is telling the truth about africa and nothing but the truth the media is not telling us the whole truth because despair civil and famine although they're part and parcel of our african reality they are not the only reality and secondly they are the smallest reality thank you very much but let me tell you and when they see him physically it is at public functions like this and even there it is him who advises them we have,1
23,AnilGupta_2009I.sph.wav,in fact they invite the honey,1
24,AnnaDeavereSmith_2005.sph.wav,sitting here alone and watching they became korean victims and other victims who in the mainstream that's why i understand that's why i have a mixed feeling about the verdict funny little play bit the atlanta airport is a modern i wish that i wish that i wish that i could be part of the enjoyment i wish that i could live together with black people the riot much difference how do you igniting fire still there out any time the other reason that i don't wear and get into the feet of somebody walking really in somebody else's shoes and i told you that in you know i didn't give you the year but in seventy nine i thought that i was going to go around and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that and i got sidetracked on race relations finally i did find a bull rider two years ago and i've been going to the rodeos with him and we've bonded and on to a destination and these trains are smooth and and he 's the lead in an op ed i did about the republican convention he 's a republican i won 't say anything about my party affiliation anyway so this is my dear dear brent williams and this is on toughness in case anybody needs to know about being tough for the work that you do i think there's a real lesson in this and this is called well i'm an optimist i mean basically i'm an optimist i mean you know i mean it's like my wife jolene her family 's always saying you know you ever think he 's just a born loser it seems like he has so much bad luck you know but then quiet and they're efficient and there's a voice on the train you know the voice was a human voice you see in the old days we and i mean funny things like this happen i was in a doctor 's office last cat scan and there was a reader 's digest october two thousand and two it was like seven ways to get lucky and she was saying you're going to make me look like an idiot because i've never been to college and i wouldn't be talking professional or anything i said well look the woman talked to me for four hours you know if i wasn't talking you know like you know she wanted me to talk i don't think she would even come out here movie eight seconds i mean like pat o 'mealey always said when i was a boy he say you know you got more try than any kid i ever seen and beauty is imitating robots and so they sewed my face up and then they had to straighten out my nose and they took these rods and shoved them up thing was once they shoved those rods up there and straightened my nose out i could breathe and i hadn't been able to this thank you when i was a little girl if you say a word often enough it becomes you and having grown up in a segregated city baltimore maryland and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors and that voice without losing a beat says because of late entry we're delayed thirty seconds just at this couple with hateful eyes and the couple 's going like this you know shrinking well i do that to steel my nerves and so i imitate a train call time has come you see well some of at the foot of calvary up you know just i see a baby a i know it's hispanic because she's speaking spanish i sort of use that idea to go around america with a tape recorder thank god for technology to interview people thinking that if i walked in their words which is also why i don't wear shoes when i perform i what is your considered opinion and the baby looks you know the way what huck did you see here 's huck he 's an illiterate kid he 's had no schooling but there's something in him and the official truth the truth was the law was that you see and huck gets on the raft and more and more less and less awareness of the pain or the other and kids i that's talk about risk taking i'm going to do somebody that nobody likes you know most actors want to do characters that are well not always but the notion especially at a conference like this i like to inspire people but since this was called risk taking i'm doing somebody who i never do because she's so unlikeable that one person actually came backstage and told me to take her out of the show she like this as a good thing but there are certain other connotations to the word risk and the same thing about the word nature what is nature maxine greene who 's a wonderful philosopher who 's and was the head of a philosophy great big philosophy kind of an organization i went to her and asked her what are the two things that she doesn't know that she still wants to know and she said well personally i still feel like i have to curtsey when i see the president of my university and i still feel as though i've got to get coffee for my male colleagues even though i've outlived most of them and she said and then intellectually i don't know enough about the negative imagination and september eleventh certainly taught us that that's a whole area we don't investigate so this piece is about a negative imagination it raises questions about what nature is what mother nature is and about what a risk can be and i got this in the maryland correctional institute for women everything i do is word for word off of a tape and i title things because i think people speak in organic poems and this is called a mirror to her mouth and this is an inmate named paulette jenkins i began to learn how to cover because i didn't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home i want everybody to think we were a normal family i mean we had all the materialistic ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes and busted lips and bruises i didn't had no more excuses and he beat me but that didn't change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family it was a nightmare and i failed them dramatically because i allowed it to go on and on and on but the night that myesha got killed and the intensity just grew and grew and grew until one night we came home from getting drugs and he got angry with myesha and he started beating her and he put her in a oh he would use a belt he had a belt because he had this warped perverted thing that myesha was having sex with her little brother and they was fondling each other that would be his reason i'm just talking about the particular night and so he put her in the bathtub and i was in the bedroom with the baby and four months before this happened four months before myesha died i thought i could really fix this man so i had a baby by him insane thinking that if i gave him his own kid he would leave mine alone and it didn't work up with three children houston myesha and dominic who was four months old when i came to and i was in the bedroom like i said he had her in the bathroom and he he every time he hit her she would fall but i dared not to move i didn't move i didn't even go and see what was i just sat there and and so she set there for about four or five hours all around her head was just swollen her head was about two sizes of sank the next morning she was on her for school and he got very excited she was dead i didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead so i there was no thing nothing coming out of her mouth he said he said he said we can 't we can't let nobody find out about this he say you've got to help me i agree i mean i've been keeping a secret for years and years and years so it just seemed like second hand to me just to keep on keeping it a secret so we went to the mall and bam it went down it went down and we told a police that we had like lost her we told a security guard that she was missing she came up wow some century to so that's an investigation of the negative imagination search for an american character with my tape recorder i thought that i was going to go around america and find it in all its aspects bull riders pig farmers drum majorettes but i sort of got tripped on race relations because my first big show was a show so this is his answer about a defining moment in american history it's a kind of an aria i would say and in many tapes that i have everybody knows that the los angeles riots happened because four cops beat up a black man named rodney king it was captured on video tape technology was played all over the world everybody thought the four cops would go to jail they did not so there were riots and what a lot of people forget is there was a second trial ordered by george bush sr and that came back with two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent i was at that trial whose stores had been burned to the ground and so this woman misters young soon han i suppose will have taught me the most that i have learned about race and she american history i in society and this is called swallowing the bitterness i used to believe think there's one you can't say many but at the end when we were in such turmoil and having all the financial problems and all the mental i began to really realize that out of this society and we are nothing why why do we have to be amount of money to survive we didn't get any because we have a and a house and we are i many african americans probably think that they won by the trial i was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict and all the they were having a party they celebrated all of south central all the churches and they say well finally well what about as i do he is the only model for black community i don't care jesse jackson model of non violence non violence and they would all like to be and i wonder if that is really justice for them to get their rights in that way,1
25,AnthonyAtala_2009P.sph.wav,i'm going to show you now a very short clip it's a five second clip of a patient who received one of the engineered organs we started implanting some of these structures over fourteen years ago so we have patients now walking around with organs engineered organs for over ten years as well i'm going to show a clip of one young lady she had a spina bifida defect actually took care and now i can just go that could be treated with tissue regeneration or replacement so what can we do about it we've talked about stem cells tonight i want see at the end of the day the promise of regenerative medicine is a single promise and that is really very simple to make our patients better thank you for your attention that's a way to do it but still ways to go to get stem cells into patients in terms of actual therapies for be great if our bodies could regenerate wouldn't it be great if we could actually harness the power of our bodies to actually heal ourselves it's not really that foreign of a concept actually it happens on the earth every day this is actually a picture of a salamander salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate you see here a little video this is actually a limb injury in this salamander and this is actually real photography timed photography showing how that limb regenerates in a period of days you see the scar form this is actually a painting that hangs at the countway library at harvard medical school and it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted in the front you see actually joe and that scar actually grows out a new limb so salamanders can do it why can't we why can't humans regenerate actually we can regenerate your body many organs and every single organ in your body has a cell population that's ready to take over at the time of injury it happens every day as you age you get older your bones regenerate every ten years your skin regenerates every two weeks so your body is constantly regenerating the challenge occurs when there is an injury at the time of injury or disease the body 's first reaction is to seal itself off from the rest of the body it basically wants to fight off infection and seal itself whether it's organs inside your body or your skin the first reaction is for scar tissue to move in to seal itself off from the outside so how can we harness that power one of the ways that we do that is actually by using smart biomaterials how does this work well on the left side here you see a urethra which was injured this is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body and you see that it is injured we basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials that you can actually use as a bridge if you build that bridge and you close off from the outside environment then you can create that bridge and cells that regenerate in your body can then cross that bridge and take that path that's exactly what you see here it's actually a smart biomaterial that we used to actually treat this patient this was an injured urethra on the left side we used that biomaterial in the middle and then six months later on the right hand side you see this reengineered urethra the patient ready for the transplant while in the back room you see hartwell harrison the chief of urology at harvard actually harvesting the kidney turns out your body can regenerate but only for small distances the maximum efficient distance for regeneration is only about one centimeter so we can use these smart biomaterials but only for about one centimeter to bridge those gaps so we do regenerate but for limited distances what do we do now if you have injury for larger organs what do we do when we have injuries for structures which are much larger than one centimeter then we can start to use cells the strategy here is if a patient comes in to us with a diseased or injured organ you can very small piece of tissue from that organ less than half the size of a postage stamp you can then tease that tissue apart and look at its basic components the patient 's own cells you take those cells out grow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities but actually these materials are fairly complex and they are designed to degrade once inside the body it disintegrates a few months later acting only as a cell delivery vehicle it's bringing the cells into the body it's allowing the cells to regenerate new tissue and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away and that's what we did for this piece of muscle this is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through the structures to actually engineer the muscle we take the cells we expand them we place the cells on the scaffold and we then place the scaffold back into the patient but actually before placing the scaffold into the patient we actually exercise it we want to make sure that we condition this muscle so that it knows what to do once we put it into the patient that's what you're seeing here you're seeing this muscle bio reactor actually exercising the muscle back and forth okay these are flat structures that we see here the muscle what about other structures this is actually an engineered blood vessel very similar to what we just did but a little bit more complex here we take a scaffold and we basically scaffold can be like a piece of paper here a blood vessel is made up of two different cell types we take muscle cells we paste or coat the outside with these muscle cells very much like baking a layer cake if you will you place the muscle cells on the outside you place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside you now have your fully seeded scaffold you're going to place this in an oven like device it has the same conditions as a human body thirty seven degrees centigrade ninety five percent oxygen you then exercise it as what you saw on that tape and on the right you actually see a carotid artery that was engineered this is actually the artery that goes from your neck they were still dealing with a lot of the same challenges as many decades ago certainly many advances many lives saved to your brain and this is an x ray showing you the patent functional blood vessel they are not nearly as complex as hollow organs hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity because you're asking these organs to act on so the bladder is one such organ same strategy we take a very small piece of the bladder less than half the size of a postage stamp we then tease the tissue apart into its two individual cell components muscle and these bladder specialized cells we grow the cells outside the body in large quantities it takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder we coat the inside with these bladder lining cells we coat the outside with these muscle cells we place it back into this oven like device from the time you take that piece of tissue six to eight weeks later you can put the organ right back into the patient this actually shows the scaffold the material is actually being coated with the cells when we did the first clinical trial for these patients we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient we brought patients in but we have a major shortage of organs in the last decade the number of patients waiting for a transplant has doubled while at the same time the actual number of transplants has remained almost entirely flat six to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery did x rays and we then composed a scaffold specifically for that patient 's size pelvic cavity for the second phase of the trials we just had different sizes small medium large and extra large i'm sure everyone here wanted an extra large right so bladders are definitely a little bit more complex than the other structures but there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it this is actually a heart valve which we and the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy we take the scaffold we seed it with cells and you can now see here the valve leaflets opening and closing we exercise these prior to implantation same strategy and then the most complex are the solid organs for solid organs they're more complex because you're using a lot more cells per centimeter this is actually a simple solid organ like the ear it's now being seeded with cartilage that's the oven like device once it's coated it gets placed there and then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold this is actually digits that we're engineering these are being layered one layer at a time first the bone we fill in the gaps with cartilage we then start adding the muscle on top and you start layering these solid structures again more complex organs but by far the most complex solid organs are actually the vascularized highly vascularized a lot of blood vessel supply organs such as the heart the liver the kidneys this is actually an example several strategies to engineer solid organs this is actually one of the strategies we use a printer and instead of using ink we use you just saw and inkjet cartridge we just use cells this is actually your typical desktop printer it's actually printing this two chamber heart one layer at a time you see the heart coming out there it takes about forty minutes to print and about four to six hours later you see the muscle cells contract this technology was developed by tao ju who worked at our institute and this is actually still of course experimental not for use in patients that really has to do with our aging population we're just getting older medicine is doing a better job of keeping us alive another strategy that we have followed is actually to use decellularized organs we actually take donor organs we actually take the donor liver we use very mild detergents and we by using these mild detergents we take all the cells out of the liver two weeks later we basically can lift this organ up it feels like a liver we can hold it like a liver it looks like a liver but it has no cells all we are left with is the skeleton if you will of the liver all made up of collagen a material that's in our bodies that will not reject we can use it from one patient to the next we then take this vascular structure and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply you can see actually that's a floroscopy we're actually injecting contrast into the organ now you can see it start we're injecting the contrast into the organ into this decellularized liver and you can see the vascular tree that remains intact we then take the cells the vascular cells blood vessel cells we perfuse the vascular tree with the patient 's own cells we perfuse the outside of the liver with the patient 's own liver cells and we can then create functional livers and that's actually what you're seeing this is still experimental but we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure experimentally but as we age our organs tend to fail more so that's a challenge not just for organs but also for tissues for the kidney as i talked to you about the first painting that you saw the first slide i showed you ninety percent of the patients on the transplant wait list are waiting for a kidney ninety percent so another strategy we're following is actually to create wafers that we stack together like an accordion if you so we stack these wafers together using the kidney cells and then you can see these miniature kidneys that we've they are actually making urine again small structures our challenge is how to make them larger and that is something we're working on right now at the institute the things that i wanted to summarize for you then is what is a strategy that we're going for in regenerative medicine if at all possible we really would like to use smart biomaterials that we can just take off the shelf and regenerate your organs we are limited with distances right now but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time if we cannot use smart biomaterials then we'd rather use your very own cells why because they will not reject we can take cells from you if you present with a diseased wind pipe we'd like to take cells from your windpipe if you present with a diseased pancreas we'd like to take cells from that organ why because we'd rather take those cells which already know that those are the cell types you want a windpipe cell already knows it's a windpipe cell we don't need to teach it to become another cell type so we prefer organ specific cells and today we can obtain cells from most every organ in your body except for several which we still need stem cells for like heart liver nerve and pancreas and for those we still need stem cells if we can not use stem cells from your body then we'd like to use donor stem cells and we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors and we're working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago stem cells from the amniotic fluid and the placenta which have those properties so at this point i do want to tell you that some of the major challenges we have you know i just showed you this presentation everything looks so good everything works these technologies really are not that easy some of the work you saw today was performed by over seven hundred researchers at our institute so i always like to show this cartoon this is how to stop a runaway stage and there you see the stagecoach driver and he goes on the top panel he goes a b c d e f he finally stops the runaway stage and those are usually the basic scientists the bottom is usually the surgeons a very stunning statistic every thirty seconds a patient dies from i'm a surgeon so that's not that funny but actually method a is the correct approach and what i mean by that is that anytime we've launched one of these technologies to the clinic we've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can in the laboratory before we ever launch these technologies to patients and when we launch these technologies to patients we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question are you ready to place this in your own loved one your own child your own family member and then we proceed because our main goal of course is first to do no harm,1
26,AnupamMishra_2009I.sph.wav,and one stores so it depends on the terrain but kund which uses the gypsum belt for that you have to go back to your calendar three million years it can be done right now and you can notice they have created a kind of false the desert is there sand dunes some small field and this is all you can notice the small holes the water will fall on this catchment and there is a slope sometimes and architects do not care about slopes in bathrooms but here they will care properly and the water will go where it should go and then it is forty feet deep the waterproofing is done perfectly better than our city contractors because not a single drop should go waste in this they collect one hundred thousand liters in one season and this is pure drinking water below the surface there is hard saline water but now you can have we should not move quickly to the desert so we often use a term called bylaws because we are used to get things but here it is unwritten by law and people make their house and the water storage tanks these raised up platforms just like this fifteen feet deep and collect rain water from roof there is a small pipe and from their courtyard it can also harvest something like twenty five thousand in a good monsoon another big one this is of course out of the hardcore desert area this is near jaipur this is called the jaigarh fort and it can six million gallons of rainwater in one season the age is four hundred years so since four hundred years it has been giving you almost six million gallons of water per season you can the price of that water it draws water from fifteen kilometers of canals you can see a modern road hardly fifty years it can break sometimes but this four hundred year old canal which draws water is is maintained for so many generations of course if you want to go inside the two doors are locked but they can be opened for ted people and them you can see person coming up with two canisters of water and the water these are not empty canisters water level is right up to this it can the color the taste the purity of this water and this is what they call zero b type of water because it comes from the clouds pure distilled water stop for a quick commercial break and then we come back to the traditional systems the government this is a very backward area and we should bring a multi million dollar project to bring water from the himalayas that's why i said that this is a commercial but we will come back once again to the water from three hundred four hundred kilometers away soon it become like this in many portions water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything of course there are some areas where water is reaching i'm not saying that it is not reaching at all but the tail end the you will notice in bikaner things like this where the water hyacinth couldn't grow the sand is flowing in these canals the bonus is that you can find wildlife around it we had full page advertisements some thirty years twenty five years ago when this canal came they said that your traditional systems these new cement tanks will supply you piped water it's a dream and it became a dream also because so welcome to the golden desert indian desert it receives the least rainfall in the country lowest soon the water was not able to reach these areas and people started renovating their own structures these are all traditional water structures which we won 't be able to explain in such a short time but you can see that no woman is standing on those and this is heart of desert this town was established eight hundred years ago i'm not sure by was there or delhi was there or chennai was there or bangalore was there so this was the terminal point for silk route well connected eight hundred years ago through able to go to europe but jaisalmer was well connected to it and this is the sixteen centimeter such a limited rainfall and highest colorful life flourished in these areas you won 't find in this slide but it is invisible somewhere a stream or a rivulet is through here or if you want to paint you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture drops and deposit in the rooms apart from this system they designed fifty two beautiful water bodies around this town and what we call private public partnership you can add estate also so public and private enterprise work together to build this beautiful water body and it's a kind of water body for all seasons you will admire it just behold the beauty throughout the year whether water level goes up or down the beauty is there throughout another water body dried up of course during the summer period but you can see how the traditional society combines these statues marvelous statues gives you an idea of water this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank it will submerge these beautiful statues in what we call in english today mass communication this everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drown so water will be there for seven months or nine months or twelve months and then they will come and small water body called the it is difficult to hundred meters and in most parts it is saline not fit for drinking so you in severe drought periods nobody has seen this water body getting dried up and perhaps that on sixth november two thousand and nine there will be a ted green and blue session so they painted it like this water body children are standing on a very difficult device to explain this is called kund we have in english it squeeze the moisture hidden in the sand and they have dubbed this water as the third one called and is a gypsum belt running below it and it was deposited by the great mother earth some million years ago and where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water this is the same dry water body now you don't find any they are all submerged but when the water goes down they will be able to draw water from those structures throughout the year this year they have received only six centimeters six there is no electricity in most of the villages but suppose you use the green technology solar pumps they are of no use in this area so welcome to the golden desert and they can telephone you that if you find any water problem in your city delhi bombay bangalore mysore please come to our area of six centimeters we can give you water how they maintain them there are three things concept planning making the actual thing and also maintaining them for maintain for centuries by generations without any department without any funding so the secret your own thing not personal property my property every time so these remind you that you are entering into a water body area don't spit don't to anything wrong so that the clean water can be on your right side if you climb these three six steps you will find something very nice this was done in eleventh century and you have to go further down they say that a picture is worth a thousand words so we can say a thousand words the water table goes down you will find new stairs if it comes up some of them will be submerged so this beautiful system will give you some pleasure three sides such steps on the fourth side there is a four story building where you can organize such ted conferences anytime who built these in front of you the best civil engineers we had the best planners the best architects we can say that clouds seldom visit this area but we find forty different names of clouds in this dialect used there were no english medium schools at that time even no hindi schools schools but such people compelled to the east india company which came here for business a very dirty kind of business but not to create the engineering colleges but because of them first engineering college was created in a small village not in the town the last point we all know in this tire comes from the airplane so look at the beauty from the desert society who can harvest rainwater and also create something through a tire from a jet plane and used in a camel last picture it's a tattoo two thousand years old tattoo they were using it on was at one time a kind of a blacklisted or con thing but now it you can copy this tattoo i have some posters of this life is water these are the beautiful waves these are the beautiful stairs which we just saw in one of these and these are the flowers which add fragrance to our lives so this is the message of desert thank you very much a number of techniques to harvest rain this is a new work it's a new program but for the

27,AriannaHuffington_2010W.sph.wav,men sleep deprivation has become a i was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before and i felt like saying to him but i didn't say it i felt like saying you know what if you had gotten five this dinner would have been a lot more there is now a kind of sleep deprivation one upmanship especially here you try to make a breakfast date and you say how about eight o 'clock they're likely to tell you eight o'clock is too late for me but that's okay i can get a game of tennis in and do a few idea is a very very small idea far too many icebergs hitting our titanics in fact i have a feeling that if lehman brothers was lehman brothers and sisters they might still be while all the brothers were busy just being hyper connected twenty four seven maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg because she would have woken up from a seven and a half or eight hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture can unlock billions of big ideas so as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment what is good for us on a personal level what's going to bring more joy gratitude effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world so i to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep thank you that are at the moment dormant inside us and my little idea that will do that is sleep this is a room of sleep deprived women and two and half years ago i fainted from exhaustion i hit my head on my desk i broke my cheek bone i got five stitches on my right eye and i began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep and in the course of that i studied i met with medical doctors scientists and i'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive more inspired more joyful life is getting enough sleep and we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution this new feminist issue we are literally going to sleep our way to the top,1
28,ArthurBenjamin_2005.sph.wav,i'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator there is something called the square of a number which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself for instance five squared would be and on most calculators that will give you the square on some of these ancient rpn calculators you've got an x squared button on it will allow you to do the calculation even faster what i'm going to try and do now is to square in my head four two digit numbers good morning ladies and gentlemen my name is art benjamin and i am a mathemagician what that means is i combine my loves of math and magic to do something i call faster than they can do on their calculators even using the shortcut method what i'll use is the second row this time and i'll get four of you one two three four yell out a two digit number and if you would square the first number and if you would square the second the third and the i will try and race you to the answer ok so quickly a two digit number please let me try to take this one step further i'm going to try to square some three digit numbers this time i won 't even write these down i'll just call them out as they're called out to me anyone i point to call out a three digit number another another three digit another another another three digit number sir let me try to take this one step further i'm going to try to square a four digit number this time now you can all take your time on this i will not beat you to the answer on this one but i will try to get the answer right nine ab nine seven seven five that does yours go in the meanwhile let me conclude so you should have as an answer either a six digit or probably a seven digit number how many digits do you have six or seven seven and yours i shall attempt the impossible or at least the improbable i see i see one way in the back you sir that's three and anybody on this side here ok you over there on the aisle would the four of you with calculators please bring out your calculators then join me up on stage and let 's give these volunteers a nice round of applause the odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing would be one in ten thousand ten to the fourth power ok any six of them really scramble them up you leave out the number seven and let 's give all four of these people for my next number while i mentally recharge my batteries i have one more question for the audience by any chance does anybody here happen to know anybody here who 'd like to know the day of the week they were born we can do it that way of course i could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know so i come prepared for that i didn't mean to look at you sir you were just sitting there you can help me out here if you wouldn't mind this is a book of calendars and yeah ok that book in front of you do me a favor turn to a year outside of the nineteen hundreds either into the eighteen hundreds or way into the i haven't had the chance to work with these calculators i need to make sure that they are all working properly would somebody get us started by giving us a two digit number please how about a two digit number things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation was a gentleman up here who had a ten digit calculator where is he would you stand up ten digit guy ok well stand up for me just for a second so i can see where you have a ten digit calculator sir as well ok what i'm going to try and do is to square in my head a five digit number requiring a ten digit calculator but to make my job more interesting for you as well as for me i'm going to do this problem thinking out loud so you can actually honestly hear what's going on in my mind while i do a calculation of this size now i have to apologize to our magician friend lennart green i know as a magician we're not supposed to reveal our secrets but i'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week let 's see let 's take a let 's take a different row of with you i'll get five digits one two three four oh i did this row already let 's do the row before you starting with you sir one two three four five call out a single digit that will be the five digit number that i will try to square add all those numbers together and with any luck arrive at the answer now let me recap while i explain something else i know that you can use right while i do these calculation you might words as opposed to numbers creep into the calculation let me explain what that is this is a phonetic code a mnemonic device that i use that allows me to convert numbers into words i store them as words and later on retrieve them as numbers i know it sounds complicated it's not i just don't want you to think you're seeing something out of rain man here there's definitely a method to my madness definitely definitely sorry want to talk to me about adhd afterwards by the way one last instruction for my judges with the calculators ok you know who you are there is at least a fifty percent chance that i will make a mistake here if i do don't tell me what the mistake is just say you 're close or something like that and i'll try and figure out the answer which could be pretty entertaining in itself if here that to fission to would you like to try a more standard calculator just in case ok great what i'm going to try and do then i notice that took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer that's ok,1
29,ArthurBenjamin_2009.sph.wav,if it's it can be a lot of fun i mean probability and statistics it's the mathematics of games and gambling it's analyzing trends it's predicting the future look the world has changed from analog to digital and it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital from the more classical continuous to the more modern discrete mathematics the mathematics of uncertainty of randomness of data and that being probability and statistics in summary instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus i think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means and i mean it thank you very much i would have a suggestion for him that i think would vastly improve the and algebra and everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject and at top of that pyramid it's calculus and i'm here to say that i think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid the correct summit that all of our students every high school graduate should know should be statistics probability and statistics don't get me wrong calculus is an important subject it's one of the great products of the human mind the laws of nature are written in the language of calculus and every student who studies math science engineering economics they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college but i'm here to say as a professor of mathematics that very few people actually use calculus in a and should use on daily basis right it's risk it's reward it's randomness it's understanding data,1
30,ArthurGanson_2004.sph.wav,and this is one that i did probably like when i was around seventh grade and i remember when i was doing this i was thinking about that little rock there and the pathway of the vehicles as they would fly through the air and how the characters would come shooting out of the car so on my mind i was thinking about the trajectory of the vehicles and of course when you're a little kid there's always destruction so it has to end with this gratuitous violence so that was how i first started to explore the way things moved and expressed it now when i went to college i found myself making fairly complicated fragile machines and this really came about from having many different kinds of interests when i was in high school i loved to program computers so i sort of liked the logical flow of events i was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surgeon it meant working with my hands in a very focused intense way so i started taking art courses and i found a way to make sculpture that brought together my love for being very precise with my hands with coming up with different kinds of logical flows of energy through a also working with wire everything that i did was both visual and a mechanical engineering decision at the same time so i was able to sort of exercise all of that now this kind of machine is as close as i can get to painting and it's full of many little trivial end points like there's a little foot here that just drags around in circles and it doesn't really mean anything it's really just for the sort of joy of its own connection i have with engineering is the same as any other engineer in that i love to solve problems i love to figure things out but the end result of what i'm doing is really completely ambiguous that's pretty ambiguous the next piece that is going to come up is an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex i gave myself the problem since i'm always liking to solve problems i gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction and solving all of the mechanical problems for getting this little man to walk back and forth kind of as a way of surviving i would go into my own very personal space and i would make things so when i started this i didn't have an overall plan for the machine but i did have a sense of the gesture and a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space and then it was a matter of starting from one point and sort of building to that final point it really it's almost like doing it came about from playing with this wishbone after dinner you know they say never play with your food but i always play with things so i had this wishbone and i thought it's kind of like a cowboy who 's been on his horse for too long and i started to make him walk across the table and i thought oh i can make a little machine that will do that make things for people as a way of you know giving showing them my love i would go into these private places and i would put my ideas so i made this device linked it up and the wishbone walks and because the wishbone is bone it's animal it's sort of a point where i think we can enter into it this kind of work is also very much like puppetry where the found object is in a sense the puppet and i'm the puppeteer at first because i'm playing with an object but then i make the machine which is sort of the stand in for me and it is able to achieve the action that i want the next piece i'll show you is a much more conceptual thought and it's a little piece called cory 's yellow chair i had this image in my mind when i saw my son 's little chair and i saw it explode so the way i saw this in my mind at first was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed and the pieces would move far out then they would begin to be pulled back with a kind of a gravitational feel to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center and they would coalesce for just a moment and my passions into objects and sort of learning how to speak with my hands so the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects is very much connected so you could perceive that there was a chair there for me it's kind of a feeling about the fleetingness of the present moment and i wanted to express that now the machine is in this case it's a real approximation of that because obviously you can't move physical matter infinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously this whole thing is about four feet wide and the chair itself is only about a few inches on the left and it goes through a gear train there are twelve pairs of fifty to one reductions so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once so i've invented it in concrete because it doesn't really matter all the now a completely different thought i'm always imagining myself in different situations i'm imagining myself as a machine what would i love i would love to be bathed in oil so this machine does nothing but just bathe itself and it's really just sort of for me it was just really about the lusciousness of oil i got a call from a friend who wanted to have a show of erotic art and i didn't have any pieces but when she suggested to be in the show this piece came to mind so it's sort of related but you can see it's much more overtly erotic with not only the idea realm but also with very much the feeling realm this is a happy machine i'll tell you it's definitely happy from an engineering point of view this is just a little four bar linkage and then again this is a found object a little fan that i found and i thought what about the gesture of opening the fan and how simply could i state something and in a case like this i'm trying to make something which is clear but also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or plant for me the process is very important because i'm inventing machines but i'm also inventing tools to make machines and the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning so this is a little wire bending tool after many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers i made that tool and then i made this other tool for sort of centering gears very quickly and my life completely changed when i found a spot welder the ideas are very disparate i'm going to show you many different kinds of pieces and there's no real connection between one or the other except that they sort of come out of my brain and that was that tool it completely changed what i could do now here i'm going to do a very poor job of silver soldering this is not the way they teach you to silver solder when you're in school i just like throw it in i mean real jewelers put little bits of solder so that's a finished when i moved to boston i joined a group called the world sculpture racing society and the idea their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best it would be whatever came across the finish line so i made this is my first racing sculpture and i thought oh i'm going to make a cart and i'm going to have it i'm going to have my hand writing faster so as i run down the street the cart 's going to talk to me and it's going to go faster faster so that's what it does then in the end what i decided was every time you finish writing the word i would stop and i would give the card to somebody on the side of the road so i would never win the race because i'm always stopping now i only have two and a half minutes i'm going to play this is a piece that for me is in some ways the most complete kind of piece because when i was a kid i also played a lot of guitar and they're all different sort of thoughts that are triggered by looking at life and seeing nature and seeing objects and just having kind of playful random thoughts about things and when i had this thought i was imagining that i would make i would have a whole machine theater evening where i would you would have an audience the curtain would open and you'd be entertained by machines on stage so i a very simple gestural dance that would be between a machine and just a very simple chair and i'm making these pieces i'm always trying to find a point where saying something very clearly and it's very simple but also at the same time it's very ambiguous and i think there's a point between simplicity and ambiguity which can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it and that leads me to the thought that all of these pieces start off in my own mind in my heart and i do my best at finding ways to express them with materials and it always feels really crude it's always a struggle but somehow i manage to sort of get this thought out into an object and then it's there ok it means nothing at all the object itself just means nothing once it's perceived and someone brings it into their own mind then there's a cycle that has been completed and to me that's the most important thing because ever since being a kid i've wanted to communicate my passion and love and that means the complete cycle of coming from inside out to the physical to someone perceiving so i'll just let this chair when i was a child i started to explore i fell in love with the way things moved so i started to explore motion by making little,1
31,ArthurPottsDawson_2010G.sph.wav,floor sustainable recyclable chairs recycled and recyclable tables forestry commission this is norwegian forestry commission wood this bench although it was uncomfortable for my mom she didn't like sitting on it so she went and bought these cushions from a local jumble sale reusing a job that was pretty good i hate waste especially walls if they're not working put a shelf on it which i did and that shows all the customers my products the whole business is run on sustainable energy this is powered by wind all of the lights are daylight bulbs paint is all low volume chemical which is very important when you're working in the room will they outlive me they probably might right here 's a reconditioned coffee machine it actually looks better than a brand new one so looking good there now reusing is vital and we filter our own water we put them in bottles refrigerate them and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again here 's a great little example if you can see this orange tree it's actually growing in a car tire which has been turned inside out and sewn up it's got my compost in it which is growing an orange tree which is restaurants and the food industry in general are pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world for every calorie of food we consume the kitchen which is in the same room i basically created a menu that allowed people to choose the amount and volume of food that they wanted to consume rather than me putting a dish down they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they okay it's a small kitchen it's about five sq meters it serves two hundred and twenty people a day we generate quite a lot of waste this is the waste room i compost it in this garden all of the soil you can see there is basically my food which is generated by the restaurant and it's growing in these tubs which i made out of storm felled trees and wine casks and all sorts of things three compost bins go through about seventy kilos of raw vegetable waste a week really good makes fantastic compost a couple of wormeries in there too and actually one of the wormeries was a big wormery i had a lot of worms in it seeing here is a water filtration system this takes the water out of the restaurant runs it through these stone beds this is going to be mint in there and i sort of water the garden with it and i ultimately want to recycle that put it back into the loos maybe wash hands with so water is a very important aspect i started meditating on that and created a restaurant called waterhouse if i could get waterhouse to be a no carbon restaurant that is consuming no gas to start with that would be great i managed to do it this is an electrical restaurant the whole thing is electric the restaurant and the kitchen and it's run on hydroelectricity so i've gone from air to water this is basically air handling i'm taking the temperature of the canal outside pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof and that in turn is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant cooling them or heating them as the this is an english willow air diffuser and that's softly moving that air current through the room very advanced no air conditioning i love it in the canal which is just outside the restaurant there is hundreds of meters of coil piping this takes the temperature of the canal and turns it into this four degrees heat exchange i have no idea how it works but i paid a lot of money for it and what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant lives on this boat it's off grid it generates all its own power he 's growing all his own fruit and that's fantastic if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later you're very welcome to the humble potato and i've spent a long time twenty five years preparing these and it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime five restaurants based on the five chinese medicine acupuncture specialities i've got water and wood i'm just about to do fire to come so you've got to watch your space for that okay so this is my next project five weeks old it's my baby and it's people i e perhaps more working class or people who actually believe in a cooperative this is a social enterprise not for profit it really is about the social disconnect between food communities in urban settings and their relationship to rural growers that's zero food waste and no one 's doing that just yet in fact sainbury 's if you're watching try it on i'm going to get there before you so nature and that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time and it's an important statement to understand if we don't stand up and make a difference and think about sustainable food think about the sustainable nature of it then we may fail but i wanted to get up and show you that we can do it if we're more first of all it's planted and that takes energy it grows and is nurtured it's then harvested the idea is embryonic i think it's important i think that if we reduce reuse refuse recycling is the last point i want to make but it's the four r 's rather than the three r 's then i think we're going to be on our way so these three are not perfect they're ideas i think that there are many problems to come but with help i'm sure i'm going to find solutions and i hope you all take part thank you very much it's then distributed and distribution is a massive issue it's then sold and bought and it's then delivered to me i basically take it prepare it and okay you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like basically a restaurant just like any other this is the restaurant acorn house front and back so let me run you through a few ideas,1

33,AshrafGhani_2005G.sph.wav,the aid system does not have the knowledge the vision the ability i'm all for it after all i raised a lot of to be exact you know i managed to persuade the world they had to give my country twenty seven point five billion they didn't want to give us the money ca and it still didn't work ag no it's not that it didn't work it's that a dollar of private in my judgment is equal at least to twenty dollars of aid in terms of the dynamic that it generates second is that one dollar of aid could be ten cents it could be twenty cents or it could be four dollars it depends on what form it comes what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it the aid system at first was designed to benefit entrepreneurs of the developed countries not to generate growth in the poor countries and this is again one of those assumptions the way car seats are an assumption that we've inherited in governments and you would think that the us government would not think that american firms needed subsidizing to function in developing countries provide advice but they do an entire weight of history vis a vis aid that now needs to be reexamined if the goal is to build states that can credibly or how provisional our consensus to be able to move forward but the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems take care of themselves and i'm putting that proposition equally you know i'm very harsh on my counterparts in each country in a definable period and every year there must be progress on mobilization of domestic revenue and generation of the economy unless that kind of compact is entered into you will not be able to sustain the most of the globe experiences the state as repressive as and in terms of experience of capitalism there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences first extractive industry blood diamonds smuggled emeralds timber that is cut right from under the poorest second is technical assistance and technical assistance might shock you but it's the worst form of today of the ugly face a public dewey long ago observed is constituted through discussion and debate if we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question of the developed world to the developing countries tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to one thousand five hundred dollars a day we do not live in three different worlds we live but that's easily said but we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living and that is that if we want to have one world this one world cannot be based on huge pockets of exclusion and then inclusion for some we must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global this open moment in history where we have a consensus on both the form of politics and the form of economics what is one of these organizations to pick we have three critical terms economy civil society and the state i will not deal with those first two except to say that uncritical transfer of assumptions from one context to another can only make for disaster economics in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context my country is dominated by drug economy and a mafia avoid doxa the realm of the unquestioned then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions and not imposition of the framework that works on the basis of mathematical modeling for which i have enormous respect my colleagues at johns hopkins were among the best second instead of debating endlessly about what is we hope to share that much widely with and third is that we could actually construct an index to measure comparatively how well these functions that we would agree on are being performed in different places so what are these functions we propose ten and it's legitimate monopoly of means of violence administrative control management of public finances investment in human capital provision of citizenship rights to debate and discussion it is in this spirit that i i won 't elaborate i hope the questions will give me an opportunity this is a feasible goal basically because contrary to widespread assumption i would argue that we know how to do this who would have imagined but people at oxford prepared for a democratic germany and engaged in planning and there are lots of other examples now in order to do this and this brings this group we have to rethink the notion of capital the least important form of capital in this project is financial capital money money is not capital in most of the developing countries it's just cash because it lacks the institutional organizational managerial forms to turn it into capital and what is required is a combination of physical capital institutional capital human capital and security of course is critical but so is information now the issue that should concern us here and that's the challenge that i would like to pose to this group is again it takes sixteen years in your countries to produce somebody with a bs degree it takes twenty years to produce somebody with a phd the first challenge is to rethink fundamentally the the time do we need to repeat what is it that we need to do fundamentally to re engage in a project that capital formation is they need different ways of being approached different ways of being enfranchised different ways of being and that's the first thing second is you're problem solvers but you're not engaging your global responsibility away from the problems of corruption you only want clean environments in which to function but if you don't think through the problems of corruption who will you stay away from design for development you're great designers but your designs are selfish it's for your own immediate use the is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work as the work on paradigms long time ago showed thomas kuhn 's work it's in the intersection of ideas that new developments true breakthroughs occur and i hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world 's poor through this means thank you what scares me most is is you lack of your engagement you know i always give the unconventional answer no but seriously the issue of afghanistan first has to be seen as at least a ten to twenty year perspective today the world of globalization is on speed time has been compressed and space does not exist for most people but in my world you know when i went back to afghanistan after twenty three years so the first is when the scale is that we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure it takes six years to deliver infrastructure in our world any meaningful sort of but the modality of attention or what is happening today what's happening tomorrow second is when a country has been subjected to one of the most immense brutal forms of exercise of power we had the red army for ten continuous years one hundred and ten thousand strong literally terrorizing the sky every afghan sees the sky as a source of fear we were bombed practically out of existence then tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism from all sides how to turn a bicycle into an instrument of terror how to turn a donkey a cart horse anything and the russians equally so when violence erupts in a country like afghanistan it's because of that legacy but we have to understand that we've been incredibly lucky i mean i really can't believe how lucky i am here standing in front of you speaking when i joined as finance minister i thought that the chances of my living more than three years would not be more than five percent the question now however is both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation you see because i mean i give you one statistic ninety one percent of the men in afghanistan eighty six percent of the women listen to at least three radio stations in terms of their discourse in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world i think that i much more sophisticated than rural americans with college degrees and the bulk of europeans because the world matters to them and what is their predominant concern abandonment afghans have become deeply internationalist you know when i went back in december of two thousand and one i had absolutely no desire to work with the afghan government because i'd lived as a nationalist and i told them my people with the americans here separate yes i have an advisory position with the u n i went through ten afghan provinces very rapidly and everybody was telling me it was a different world you know they engage they see engagement global engagement as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people and the thing that the ordinary afghan is most concerned with is clare lockhart is here so i'll recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in northern afghanistan and that woman said she didn't care whether she had food on her table what she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future where her children could really have a different life that gives me hope how is afghanistan going to provide alternative income to the many people who are making their living off the drugs trade the first is instead of sending a billion dollars on drug eradication and paying it to a couple of security companies but we must acknowledge that this moment has brought about a rare consensus of assumptions and that they should give this hundred billion dollars to fifty of the most critically innovative companies in the world to ask them to create one million jobs to the drug eradication is jobs look there's a very little known fact countries that have a legal average income per capita of one thousand dollars don't produce drugs if you want us to be able to compete with china and to attract investment we could probably attract four to six billion dollars and we need to understand it's the value chain look and the ordinary afghan is sick and tired of hearing about microcredit it is important but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro production want is global access they don't want to sell to the charity bazaars that are only for foreigners and the same bloody shirt embroidered time and again what we want is a partnership with the italian design firms we have the best embroiderers in the world why can't we do what was done with northern italy with the put out so i think economically the critical issue really is to now think through and what i will say here is that aid doesn't work you know the aid system is broken,1
34,AubreydeGrey_2005G.sph.wav,of course one can make a biological argument one can say ok what are we made of we're made of cells and stuff between cells what can damage accumulate in the answer is long lived molecules because if a short lived molecule undergoes damage but then the molecule is destroyed like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis then the damage is gone too it's got to be long lived molecules so these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news because it means that you know we've come a long way in biology in these twenty years so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done i haven't got time to go through them at all but my conclusion is that if we can actually get suitable funding for this then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only ten years but we do need to get serious about it we do need to really start trying so of course there are some biologists in the audience and to some of the questions that you may have you may have been dissatisfied with this talk but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff i've published a great deal on this i the experimental work on which my optimism is based and there's quite a lot of detail there the detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that i'm predicting here so if you think that i'm wrong you'd better damn well go and find out why you think i'm wrong i like in an audience in britain especially to talk about the comparison with fox hunting which is something that was banned after a long struggle and of course the main thing is that you shouldn 't trust people who call themselves gerontologists because as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field you know you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously so you know you've got to actually do your homework in order to understand whether this is true with a few things one thing is you know you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in and everyone said well it's obviously impossible and you know what happened so you know this does happen we have various strategies there's the methuselah mouse prize which is basically an incentive to innovate and to do what you think is going to work and you get money for it if you win there's a proposal to actually put together an institute this is what's going to take a bit of money but i mean look how long does it take to spend that on the war in iraq not very long ok it's got to be philanthropic because profits distract biotech but it's basically got a ninety percent chance i think of succeeding in this and i think we by the government not very many months ago i mean i know i'm with a sympathetic audience here but as we know a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic because i am an old man i am actually one hundred and fifty eight on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate which is that no aging is not a product of selection evolution is simply a product of evolutionary neglect in other words and this is actually a rather good comparison it seems to me you know a lot of people said well you know city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time it's a traditional part of the way of life and we should be we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging you need more genetic pathway more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowly and that carries on being true you push it out so to the extent that evolution doesn't matter doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals living a long time or by procreation amount of modulation of that which is why different species have different lifespans but that's why there are no immortal species ca the genes don't care but we do ag that's right hello i read somewhere that in the last twenty years the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by ten years if i project that would make me think that i would live until one hundred and twenty if i don't crash that means that one of your subjects to become a one thousand year old if you i was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo and that the brain cells last eighty years or so if that is indeed true biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation if there are cells in my body that live all eighty years as opposed to a typical you know couple of months there are technical implications certainly basically what we need to do is replace cells in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate especially neurons no aging hydra for example but they do it by not having a nervous system and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long lived cells to carry on doing it it's ecologically sound it stops the population explosion of foxes but ultimately the government prevailed in the end because the majority of the british public and certainly the majority of members of parliament to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society and i think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades what part of this do people not understand it's not just about life it's about healthy life you know getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun and i mean ok i'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless there are some good points to be made here things that we ought to be thinking about forward planning so that nothing goes too well so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging but these are completely crazy when you actually remember your sense of proportion you know these are arguments these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about but the question is are they so dangerous these risks of doing something about aging that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite namely leaving aging as it is are these so bad that they outweigh condemning one hundred thousand people a day to an unnecessarily early death and you know a lot of people try to fudge this question and give answers like this i don't agree with those answers i think they basically don't work i think it's true that we will face a dilemma in this respect we will have decide whether to have a low birth rate or a high death rate a high death rate will of course arise from simply rejecting these therapies in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids and i say that that's fine the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice what's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future if we vacillate hesitate and do not actually develop these therapies then we are condemning a whole cohort of people who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies to talk about feasibility as well of course i'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging and then i'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about but will not be because we haven't developed them as quickly as we could we'll be denying those people an indefinite life span and i consider that that is immoral that's my answer to the overpopulation question right so the next thing is now why should we get a little bit more active on this and the fundamental answer is that the pro aging trance is not as dumb as it looks it's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging aging is ghastly but it's inevitable so you know we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do to do that like for example making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all but of course this becomes part of the problem this pro aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things and that's why we have to really aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place which is to say metabolism this is not you know how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong namely by actually doing something about it i'm going to do that in two steps the first one i'm going to talk about is a completely tautological statement it's a reasonable statement aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars and it also happens to us despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self repair mechanisms because those self repair mechanisms are not perfect so basically metabolism which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next has side effects those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology that's a fine definition so we can put it this way we can say that you know we have this chain of events the geriatrician will intervene late in the day when pathology is becoming evident and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time and stop the but unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well in fact we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work even cells we're not really too good on yet we've discovered things like for example rna interference only a few years ago and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work basically gerontology is a fine approach in the end but it is not an approach whose time has come when we're talking about intervention so then how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension which i'm going to define as thirty years applied to people who are already in middle age when you start to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging namely essentially an elimination of the just suppose as i said that we do acquire let 's say we do it today for sake of argument the ability to confer thirty extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age let 's say fifty five i'm going to call that robust human rejuvenation ok what would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today or equivalently of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive would actually live that question you might think it's simple but it's not simple we can't just say well if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies then they'll live thirty years longer that's the wrong and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs now they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time but after that things were pretty steady and pretty uniform i think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight we can think really that each one is beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one if you like the incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore this is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough and you see it in all sorts of technologies computers you can look at a more or less parallel time line happening of course a bit later you can look at medical care i mean hygiene vaccines antibiotics you know the same sort of time frame so i think that actually step two that i called a step a moment ago isn't a step that in fact the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension even though those people are already middle aged when the therapies arrive will be at some sort of cusp they will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further thirty or maybe fifty years in other words they will be staying ahead of the game the therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us this is a very important point for me to get across because you know most people when they hear that i predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to one thousand or more they think that i'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are but we'll be able to fix the things that two hundred year olds die of before we have any two hundred year olds and the same for three and four hundred and so on i decided to give this a little name which is longevity escape velocity across so these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live in terms of remaining life expectancy as measured by their health given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive if you're already one hundred or even if you're eighty and an average eighty year old we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies because you're too close to death 's door for the really initial eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense in terms of your youthfulness both physical and mental and in terms of your risk of death from of course if you're a bit younger than that then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age related causes so this is a genuine but irrespective of that age i'm claiming that the first person to live to one thousand all right so finally i'm going to spend the rest of the talk my last seven and a half minutes on step one namely how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity and in order to do that i need to talk about mice a little bit i have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation i'm calling it robust mouse rejuvenation not very imaginatively and this is what it is i say we're going to take a long lived strain of mouse which basically means mice that live about three years on average we do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old and then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them and with those therapies we get them to live on average to their fifth birthday i want to ask a question hands up anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria that was easy ok ok hands up anyone in the audience who 's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing and it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question and it's extremely hard to answer one has to be very speculative and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation that we should simply assess their priorities so i say that we have a fifty fifty chance of reaching this rhr milestone robust human rejuvenation within fifteen years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation fifteen years from the robust mouse the public 's perception will probably be somewhat better than that the public tend to underestimate how difficult scientific things are so they'll probably think it's five years away they'll be wrong but that actually won 't matter too much and finally of course i think it's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance i spoke about earlier the coping strategy that will be history at this point because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice so we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people 's attitudes and of course that has enormous implications so in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice i'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging i'm going to use this word damage to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology ok so we all think malaria is a bad thing that's very good news because i thought that was what the answer would be now the thing is i would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with but it is not part of metabolism itself and this turns out to be useful because we can re draw our original diagram this way we can say that fundamentally the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the which metabolism lays down this damage and i'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment and geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology and the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate so there's a third approach if we look at it this way we can call it the engineering approach and i claim that the engineering approach is so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist that causes it to be pathogenic we know that this threshold exists because we don't get age related diseases until we're in middle age even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born why do i say that we're in range well this is basically it the point about this slide is actually the bottom if we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging we will be here all night because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another this list is just for illustration it is incomplete the list on the right is also incomplete it's a list of types of pathology that are age related and it's just an incomplete list but i would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete this is the list of thing that qualify as damage side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end or that might cause pathology and there are only seven of them thing of course but there's only seven of them cell loss mutations in chromosomes mutations in the mitochondria and so on first of all i'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete aging and here is that characteristic the only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria,1
35,AuretvanHeerden_2010G.sph.wav,they didn't say money they said the people who employ us treat us like we are less than human please ask them to treat us like human beings that's my simple understanding of human rights in this room everybody out there we can all make a decision to come together and pick up the balls and run with the balls that governments have dropped if we don't do it we're abandoning hope we're abandoning our essential humanity and all of those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in manila these places these origins represent governance gaps that's the politest description i have for them these are the dark pools where global supply chains begin the global supply chains which bring us our favorite brand name products some these governance gaps are run by rogue states some of them are not states anymore at all they're failed states some of them are just countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation is the best way to attract investment promote trade now i didn't come here to depress you about the state of the global supply chain we need a reality check we need to recognize just how serious a deficit of rights we have this is an independent republic probably a failed state it's definitely not a democratic state and right now that independent republic of the supply chain is not being governed in a way that would satisfy us that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption now that's not a new story you've seen the documentaries of sweatshops making garments all over the world even in developed countries you want to see the classic sweatshop meet me at madison square garden i'll take you down the street and i'll show you a chinese but take the example of heparin you expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital probably squeaky clean the problem is is that the active ingredient in there as i mentioned earlier comes from pigs by armed gangs using child slaves what the u n security council calls blood minerals then traveled into some components and ended up in a factory in shinjin in china and when their factory in china which probably is pretty clean is getting all of the ingredients from backyard some of the suppliers realized that they could substitute a product which mimicked heparin in the answer is quite simple the chinese define these facilities as chemical facilities not pharmaceutical facilities so and the u s fda has a jurisdictional problem this is five hundred of these facilities producing active ingredients in china in fact about eighty percent of the active ingredients in medicines now come from offshore particularly china and india and we don't have a governance system we don't have a regulatory system able to ensure that that production we don't have a system to ensure that human rights basic dignity are ensured so at a national level and we work in about sixty different countries at a national level we've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments to regulate the real problem with the global supply chain is that it's supranational so governments who are failing who are dropping the ball that factory over a dozen people have committed suicide already this year at a national level have even less ability to get their arms around the problem at an international level and you can just look at the headlines take copenhagen last year complete failure of governments to do the right thing in the face of an international challenge take the g twenty meeting a couple of weeks ago stepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago you can take any one of the major global simple answer is they can 't they're national one man died after working a thirty six voters are local they have parochial interests they can't subordinate those interests to the greater global public good so if we're going to ensure the delivery of the key public goods at an international level in this case in the global supply chain we have to come up with a different mechanism we need a different machine fortunately we have some examples in the nineteen nineties there were a whole series of scandals concerning the production of brand name goods in the u s child labor forced labor serious health and safety abuses we all love chocolate we buy it for our kids eighty percent of the cocoa comes from cote d 'ivoire and ghana and it's harvested by children how to prevent that but i'm at least going to use my good offices to get you folks together to come up with a response so they formed a white house task force and they spent about three years arguing about who takes how much responsibility in the global supply chain companies didn't feel it was their responsibility those facilities they don't employ those workers they're not legally liable agreed okay what we'll do is we agree on a common set of standards make it part of the contract and that was a stroke of absolute genius because what they did was they harnessed the power of the contract private power to deliver public goods and let 's face it the contract from a major multinational brand to a supplier in india or china has much more persuasive value than the local labor law the local environmental regulations the local human rights standards we have a huge problem of child slaves children have been trafficked from other conflict zones to come and work on the coffee plantations those factories will probably never be amazing if they were able to even if they did their jobs and they cited those facilities for their violations the fine would be derisory but you lose that contract for a major brand name that's the difference between staying in business or going bankrupt makes a difference so what we've been able to do is we've been able to harness the power and the influence of the only truly transnational institution in the global supply chain that of the multinational company and get them to do the right thing get them to use that power for good to deliver the key public goods now of course this doesn't come naturally to multinational companies they weren't set up to do this they're set up to make money but they are extremely efficient organizations they have resources and if we can add the will the commitment they know how to deliver that product heparin blood thinner a pharmaceutical product starts out in artisanal workshops like this in china now getting there is not easy those supply chains i put up on the screen earlier they're not safe space you need a place where people can come together sit down without fear of judgment without recrimination to actually face the problem agree on the problem and come up with solutions we can do it the technical solutions are there the problem is the lack of trust the lack of confidence the lack of partnership between ngo 's campaign groups we can put those two together in a safe space get them to work together we can deliver public goods right now or in extremely short supply this is a radical proposition and it's crazy to think that if you're fifteen year old bangladeshi girl leaving your rural village to go and work in a factory in dhaka crazy multinationals are protecting human rights i know there's going to be disbelief you'll say how can we trust well we and then we publish the results you can call yourself responsible but responsibility without accountability often doesn't work need to believe me you shouldn 't believe me go to the website look at the audit results ask yourself is this company behaving in a socially responsible way can i buy that product without compromising my ethics that's the way the system works i hate the idea that governments are not protecting human rights around the world i hate the idea that governments have dropped this ball and i can't get used to the idea that somehow we can't get them to do their jobs i've been at this for thirty years and in that time i've seen the ability the commitment the will of government to do this decline and i don't see them making a comeback right now so we started out thinking this was a stopgap measure companies and ngo 's are going to have to get together to face the major challenges we are going to face just look at pandemics swine flu bird flu h one n one look at the health systems in so many countries do they have the resources to face up to a serious pandemic could the private sector and ngo 's get together and marshal a response absolutely the second biggest exporter of cotton on earth every year when it comes to the cotton harvest the government shuts down the schools puts the kids in buses what they lack is that safe space to come together agree and move to action that's what we're trying to provide as well that this often seems like overwhelming level of responsibility for people to you want me to deliver human rights it seems too daunting too dangerous for any company to take on but there are companies we have four thousand companies who are members some of them are very very large companies the sporting goods industry in particular stepped up to the plate and have done it the example the role model and whenever we discuss one of these problems that we have to address child labor in cottonseed farms in india this year we will monitor fifty thousand cottonseed farms in india it seems overwhelming the numbers just make you but we break it down to some basic realities and human rights comes down to a very simple proposition can i give this person their dignity back poor people people whose human rights have been violated the crux of that is the loss of dignity the lack of it starts with just giving people back their dignity i was sitting in a slum outside gurgaon just next to delhi one of the flashiest brightest new cities popping up in india right now and i was talking to workers who worked in garment sweatshops down the road and i asked them what message they would like me to take the brands,1
36,BarbaraBlock_2010Z.sph.wav,same thing with laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes up to the same zone the tunas use you can see why they might be caught then there's george schillinger and our leatherback team out of playa grande tagging leatherbacks that go right past where we are and scott benson 's team that showed that leatherbacks go from indonesia all the way to monterrey there is a gold rush on earth and this is a gold rush for bluefin there are traps that fish sustainably up until recently so what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predators are we can actually see how they're using ecospaces as large as an ocean and from this information we can begin to map the hope spots right so this is just three years of data right here and there's a decade of this data we see the pulse and the seasonal activities that these animals are going on so what we're able to do with this information is boil it down to hot spots four thousand deployments a huge herculean task two thousand tags in an area shown here for the first time off the california coast that appears to be a gathering place and then for sort of an encore from these animals they're helping us they're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down two thousand meters they're taking information from our planet at very critical places like antarctica and the poles those are seals from many countries and then as these animals swim and give us the information that's important to climate issues we also think it's critical to get this information to the public to engage the public with this kind of data we did this with the great turtle race and yet the type of fishing going on today with pens with enormous stakes is really wiping bluefin ecologically off the planet tagged turtles brought in four million hits and now with google 's oceans we can actually put a white shark in that ocean and when we do and it swims we see this magnificent bathymetry that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from california to hawaii but maybe mission blue can fill in that ocean that we can't see we've got the capacity nasa has the ocean we just need to put it together so in conclusion we know where yellowstone is for north america it's off our coast we have the technology that's shown us where it is what we need to think about perhaps for mission blue is increasing the biologging capacity how is it that we can actually take this type of activity elsewhere a lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the golden gate bridge let 's connect the public to this activity right on their iphone that way we do away with a few internet myths so we can save the bluefin tuna we can save the white shark we have the science and technology hope is here yes we can we need just to apply this capacity further in the oceans thank you now bluefin in general goes to one place japan some of you may be guilty of having contributed to the demise of bluefin they're delectable muscle rich in fat absolutely taste delicious and that's their problem we're eating them to death now in the atlantic the story is pretty simple bluefin have two populations one large one small the north american population is fished at about two thousand ton the european population and north african the eastern bluefin tuna is fished at tremendous levels fifty thousand tons over the last decade almost every year the result is whether you're looking at the west or the eastern bluefin population there's been tremendous decline on both sides as much as ninety percent if you go back to lions to certain african elephants and to pandas these fish have been proposed for an endangered species listing in the past two months they were voted on and rejected just two weeks ago despite outstanding science that shows from two committees this fish meets the criteria of cites i and if it's tunas you don't care about perhaps you might be interested that international long lines chase down tunas and bycatch animals such as leatherbacks sharks marlin albatross these animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries the challenge we face is that we know very little about tuna and everyone in the room knows what it looks like when an african lion takes down its prey i doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed this tuna symbolizes what's the problem for all of us in the room and go deep into the seas remotely and we've got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean realm works most of us from the ship even i look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea we don't know where the structure is we can't tell where are the watering holes like we can on an african plain they're the largest of the tunas the second largest fish in the sea bony fish they actually are a fish that is endothermic powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal we can't see the corridors and we can't see what it is that brings together a tuna a leatherback and an albatross we're only just beginning to understand how the physical oceanography and the biological oceanography come together to create a seasonal force that actually causes the upwelling that might make a hot spot a hope spot the reasons these challenges are great is that technically it's difficult to go to sea it's hard to study a bluefin on its turf the entire pacific realm it's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it so the story of our team a dedicated team is fish and chips we basically are taking the same satellite phone parts or the same and for the first time we're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean using light and photons to measure sunrise and sunset now i've been working with tunas for over fifteen years i have the privilege of being a partner with the monterrey bay aquarium we've actually taken a sliver of the ocean put it behind glass and we together have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display when the veil of bubbles lifts every morning we can actually see a community from the pelagic ocean one of the only places on earth you can see giant bluefin swim by we can see in their beauty of form and function their ceaseless activity they're flying through their space ocean space brought in both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity we'd been studying these fish but first we had to learn how to husbandry them what do they like to eat what is it that they're happy with we go in the tanks with the tuna we touch their naked skin it's pretty amazing it feels wonderful and then better yet we've got our own version of tuna whisperers our own chuck farwell alex norton who can take a big tuna and in one motion put it into an envelope of water so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea we're taking this data and building better models and when i see that tuna this is my favorite view i begin to wonder how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did so take a look at that animal that's the closest you'll probably ever get now the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean so in a program called tag a giant we've actually gone ireland to canada from corsica to spain we've fished with many nations around the world in an effort to basically put electronic computers inside giant tunas for ocean swimming it flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins gets lift powers its movements with a lunate tail it's a very hard process but it's a ballet we bring the tuna out we measure it a team of fishers captains scientists and technicians work together to keep this animal out of the ocean for about four to five minutes we put water over its gills give it oxygen and then with a lot of effort and from our data that gets collected when that tag comes back because a fisher returns it for a thousand dollar the size of the biggest tuna we've ever tagged it takes a human effort a team effort to bring the fish in in this case what we're going to do is put a pop up satellite archival tag on the tuna this tag rides on the tuna senses the environment around the tuna and actually will come off the fish detach float to the surface and send back to earth orbiting satellites position data estimated by math on the tag both the electronic tags i'm talking about are expensive these tags have been engineered by a variety of teams in north america they are some of our finest instruments our new technology in the ocean today one community in general has given more to help us than any other community and that's the fisheries off the state of north carolina there are two villages harris and morehead city eight hundred to nine hundred fish in this case we're actually going to measure the fish we're going to do something that in recent years we've started take a mucus sample watch how shiny the skin is you can see my reflection there and from that mucus we can get gene profiles we can get information on gender checking the pop up tag one more time and then it's out in the ocean now bluefin were revered by man for all of human history for four thousand years we fished sustainably for this animal the tuna wants to go it wants to forage on schools of herring but it can't get there it's too cold but then it warms up and the tuna pops in gets some fish maybe comes back to home base goes in again and then comes back to winter down there in north carolina and then on to the bahamas and my favorite scene three tunas going into the gulf of mexico three tunas tagged so from data like this we're able now to put the map up and in this map you see thousands of positions on the hot spots the hope spots they're mixed populations and so what we've done with the science is we're showing the international commission building new models showing them that a two stock no mixing model to this day used to reject the cites treaty that model isn't the right model this is model a model of overlap is the way to move forward so we can then predict where management places should be places like the gulf of mexico and the mediterranean are places where the single species the single population can be captured these become forthright in places we need to protect the center of the atlantic where the mixing is i could imagine a policy that lets canada and america fish because they manage their fisheries well they're doing a good job and it's evidenced in the art that we see from thousands of years ago bluefin are in cave paintings in france they're in coins that date back now in a second project called tagging of pacific pelagics we took on the planet as a team those of us in the census of marine life and funded primarily through sloan foundation and others we were able to actually go in in our project we're one of seventeen field programs and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators not just tunas so what we've done is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in alaska met salmon shark on their home territory them catching salmon and then went in and figured out that if we take a salmon and put it on a line we can actually take up a salmon shark this is the cousin of the white shark and very carefully note i say very carefully we can actually keep it calm put a hose in its mouth keep it off the deck and then tag it with a satellite tag that satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message and that shark leaping there if you look carefully has an antenna it's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon sending home its data and come into monterrey now right next door in monterrey and up at the farallones are a white shark team led by scott anderson there and sal jorgensen they can throw out a target it's a carpet shaped like a seal and in will come a white shark a curious critter that will come right up to our sixteen ft boat it's a several thousand pound animal and three thousand years this fish was revered by humankind it was fished sustainably till all of time except for our generation bluefin are pursued wherever they go we also tag makos with our noaa colleagues blue sharks and now together what we can see on this ocean of color that's temperature we can see ten day worms of makos and salmon sharks we have white sharks and blue sharks for the first time an ecoscape as large as ocean scale showing where the sharks go stick out the tuna and then let them go they get returned and when they get returned here on a nasa our team from ucsc has tagged elephant seals with tags that are glued on their heads that come off when they slough these elephant seals cover half half an ocean,1
37,BarrySchuler_2008P.sph.wav,of the plants themselves if you take a closer look at a root system you will find there are many many many diverse microbial colonies this is not big news to viticulturists they have been you know concerned with water and fertilization and again this is sort of my notion of shit against the wall pharmacology you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in you don't necessarily know with granularity we've seen so much change and we've given ourselves these tools now these high powered tools that are allowing us to turn the lens inward into something that is common to we all talk about terroir we worship terroir we say wow is my terroir great it's so special i've got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn't believe well you know we really we argue and debate about it we say it's climate it's soil it's this well guess what we can figure out what the heck terroir is it's in there waiting to be sequenced there are thousands of microbes there easy to sequence unlike a human they you know have a thousand two thousand genes we can figure out what they are all we have to do is go around and sample dig into the ground find those bugs sequence them correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don't like that's just a big database and then fertilize and then we understand what is terroir so some people will say oh my god are we playing god are we now if we engineer organisms are we playing god and you know people would always ask james watson he 's not always the most politically correct guy and they would say are you know are you playing god and he had the best answer i ever heard to this question i consider myself a very spiritual person and without you know the organized religion part and i will tell you i don't believe there's anything unnatural i don't believe that but we don't make anything unnatural now we can create bad impacts we can poison ourselves we can poison the earth but that's just a natural outcome of a mistake we so what's happening today is nature is presenting us with a toolbox and we find that this toolbox is very extensive there are microbes out there that actually make gasoline believe it or not there are microbes you know go back to yeast these are chemical factories the most sophisticated chemical factories are provided by nature and we all of us and that is a genome also is a set of rules nature will not allow you to we could engineer a grape plant but guess what we can't make the grape plant produce babies nature has put a set of rules out there we can work within the rules we can't break the rules we're just learning what the rules are i just ask the question if you could cure all disease if you could make disease go away because we understand how it actually works if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious healthy plants that grow in very hard to grow environments how 's your genome today have you thought about it lately heard about it at least if we could create clean and plentiful energy we right in the labs at synthetic genomics have single celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline is highly refined we could solve our energy problems we can reduce co two we could clean up our oceans we could make better wine if we could would we well you know i think the answer is very simple working with nature working with this tool set that we now understand i really don't understand so i will tell you right off of the bat you've heard of dna you probably studied a little bit in biology a genome is really a description for all of the dna that is in a living organism and one thing what's happening genes and chromosomes and when watson and crick in the fifties first decoded this beautiful double helix that we know as and how this revolution is about to change everything we know about the world life ourselves the dna molecule very long complicated molecule we then started on this journey to understand that all of the dna in your body has been around since the beginning of us of us as creatures there is a historical archive living in your genome is the history of our species and you as an individual human being where you're from going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years and that's now starting to be understood but also the genome is really the instruction manual it is the program it is the code of life it is what makes you function it is what makes every organism function dna is a very elegant molecule it's long and it's complicated really all you have to know about it is that there's four letters a t c g they represent the name of a chemical and with these four letters you can create a language a language that can describe anything and very complicated things you know they are generally put together in pairs creating a word or what we call base pairs and you would you know when you think about it and how we think about them if you saw two thousand and one a space odyssey and you heard the boom boom boom boom and you saw the monolith you know that was arthur c clarke 's representation that letters or the representation of four things makes us work and that may not sound very intuitive but let me flip over to something else you know about and that's computers look at this screen here and you know you see pictures and you see words but really all there are are ones and zeros the language of technology is binary you've probably heard that at some point in time everything that happens in digital is converted or a representation of a one and a zero so when you're listening to itunes and your favorite a lot of ways to describe mechanisms so let 's talk about what that means so if you look at a human genome they consist of three point two billion of these base pairs that's a lot and they mix up in all different fashions and that makes you a human being if you convert that to binary just to give you a little bit of sizing we're actually smaller than the program microsoft office it's not really all that much data i will also tell you we're at least as buggy this here is a bug in my genome that i have struggled with for a long long time when you get sick it is a bug in your genome in fact many many diseases we have struggled with for a long time like cancer we haven't been able to cure because we just don't understand how it works the genomic level we are starting to understand that so up to this point we tried to fix it by using what i call shit against the wall pharmacology which means we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species in this case it was picking up bones and creating a tool using it as a tool which meant that well let 's just throw chemicals at it and maybe it's going to make it work but if you really understand why does a cell go from normal cell to cancer what is the code what are the exact instructions that are making it do that then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out so for your next dinner over a great bottle of wine here 's a few factoids for you we actually have about twenty four thousand genes that do things we have about a hundred one hundred and twenty thousand others that don't appear to function every day but represent this archival history of how we used to work as a species going back tens of thousands of years you might also be interested in knowing that a mouse has about the same amount of genes they recently sequenced pinot noir and it also has about thirty thousand genes so the number of genes you have may not necessarily represent the complexity or the evolutionary order of any particular species now look around just look next to your neighbor look forward look backward we all look pretty different a lot of very handsome and pretty people here skinny chubby different races cultures we are all ninety nine point nine percent genetically equal it is one one hundredth of one percent of genetic material that makes the difference between any one of us that's a tiny amount of material but the way that ultimately expresses itself is what makes changes in humans and in all species apes just sort of running around and eating and doing each other figured out they can make things if they used a tool all the time the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human for about dollar five thousand in about an hour or a half hour you will see that happen in the next five years and what that means is you are going to walk around with your own personal genome on a smart card it will be here and when you buy medicine you won 't be buying a drug that's used for everybody you will give your genome to the pharmacist and your drug will be made for you and it will work much better than the ones that were you won 't have side effects all those side effects you know oily residue and you know whatever they in those commercials forget about that they're going to make all that stuff go away what does a genome look like well there it is it is a long long series of these base pairs if you saw the genome for a mouse of for a human it would look no different than but what scientists are doing now is they're understanding what these do and what they mean because what nature is doing is double clicking all the time and that moved us to the next level and you know we in the last thirty years in particular have seen this acceleration in knowledge and in other words the first couple of sentences here assuming this is a grape plant make a root make a branch create a blossom in a human being down in here it could be make blood cells start cancer for me it may be every calorie you consume you conserve because i come from a very cold climate for my wife eat three times as much and you never put on any weight it's all hidden in this code and it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace so what can we do with genomes now that we can read them now that we're starting to have the book of life well there's many things some are exciting some people will find very scary i will tell you a couple of things that will probably make you want to projectile puke on me but that's okay so you know we now can learn the history of organisms you can do a very simple test scrape your cheek send it off you can find out how we may be able to fix them because we can understand this we can fix them make better organisms far better and smarter than us has given us that toolbox and we now have the ability to use it you have a uti you've probably or ever had a uti you've come in contact with this little bug very simple only has about two hundred and forty six genes but we were able to completely synthesize that genome now you have the genome and you say to yourself so if i plug this synthetic genome if i pull the old one out and plug it in does it just boot up and live not only does it do that if you took the genome that synthetic genome and you plugged it into a different critter like yeast you now turn that yeast into sort of like booting up a pc with a mac os software well actually you could do it the other way so you know by being able to write a genome and plug it into an organism the software if you will changes the hardware and this is extremely profound last year the french and italians announced they got together and they went ahead and they sequenced pinot noir the genomic sequence now exists for the entire pinot noir organism they identified once again about twenty nine thousand genes they have discovered pathways that create flavors although it's very important to understand that those compounds that it's cranking out have to match a receptor in our genome in our tongue for us to understand and interpret those flavors they've also discovered that there's a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well knowing that we can read it knowing that we can write it change it maybe write its genome from scratch in your home and in not just your pc but in every device in your washing machine well one thing you could do is what some people might call franken we can build a better vine by the way just so you know you get stressed out about genetically modified organisms there is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere that is not genetically modified not grown from seeds they're grafted into root stock they would not exist in nature on their own so don't worry about don't stress about that stuff we've been doing this forever so we could you know focus on disease resistance we can go for higher yields without necessarily having dramatic farming techniques to do it or we could conceivably expand the climate window we could make pinot noir grow maybe in long island god forbid we could produce better flavors and aromas you want a little more raspberry a little more chocolate here or there all of these things could conceivably be done and i will tell you i 'd pretty much bet that it will be done but there's an ecosystem here in other words we're not sort of unique little organisms running around we are part of a big your cellphone you're walking around your car has twelve microprocessors then we go along and create the internet and connect the world together we flatten the world i'm sorry to inform you that inside of your digestive tract is about ten pounds of microbes which you're circulating through your body quite a bit our ocean 's teaming with microbes in fact when craig venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet by discovering all new microbes in the first twenty feet of water we now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate and regulating co two and oxygen than plants do which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere we find microbial life in every part of the planet in ice in coal in rocks in,1
38,BarrySchwartz_2009.sph.wav,are behind you this will fail and there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you because different people in different communities organize their lives in different ways so there's a lot here at ted and at other places to celebrate and you don't have to be a mega hero there are ordinary heroes ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too as practitioners each and everyone of us should strive to be ordinary if not extraordinary heroes as heads of organizations we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will even the wisest and most well meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work if you run an organization you should be sure that none of the jobs none of the jobs have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors because the truth is that any work that you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work and any moral work depends upon practical wisdom and perhaps most important as teachers we should strive to be the ordinary heroes the moral exemplars to the people we mentor the janitor 's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital and yet and there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers one is that we are always teaching someone is always watching the camera is always on bill gates talked about the importance of education and in particular the model that kipp was providing knowledge is power and he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that kipp is doing to take inner city kids and turn them in the direction of college i want to focus on one particular thing kipp is doing that bill didn't mention that is that they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character they need to learn to respect themselves they need to learn to respect their schoolmates they need to learn to respect their teachers and most important they need to learn to respect learning that's the principle objective if you do that the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill and the teachers the way you teach these things to the kids is by having the teachers and all the other staff when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like they encountered mike other virtues honesty kindness courage and so on to be displayed at the right time and in the right way he also appealed to hope right again think there is reason for hope i think people want to be allowed to be virtuous in many ways it's what ted is all about wanting to do the right thing in the right way for the right reasons this kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention paying attention to what we do to how we do it and perhaps most importantly to the structure of the organizations in which we work so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than having it suppressed thank you very much thank you who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because mister jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise trying to build up his strength walking slowly up and down the hall you and charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor 's admonition and didn't vacuum the visitor 's lounge because there were some family members who were there all day every day who at this moment happened to be taking a nap his inaugural address barack obama appealed and then there was luke who washed the floor in a comatose young man 's room twice and behavior like this from janitors from technicians from nurses and if we're lucky now and then from doctors each of us to give our best doesn't just make people feel a little better it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well now not all janitors are like this of course but the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness care and empathy are an essential part of the job as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis but what did he appeal to he did not happily follow in the footsteps of his predecessor and tell us to just go shopping and yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings these janitors have the moral will to do right by other people and beyond this they have the moral skill to figure out what doing right means practical wisdom aristotle told us is the combination of moral will and moral skill a wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives a wise person knows how to improvise as luke did when he re washed the floor real world problems are often ambiguous and ill defined and the context is always changing a wise person is like a jazz musician using the notes on the page but dancing around them inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand a wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims to serve other people not to manipulate other people and finally perhaps most important a wise person is made not born wisdom depends on experience and not just any experience you need the time to get to know the people that you're serving you need permission to be allowed to improvise try new things occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures and you need to be mentored by wise teachers when you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones i described how hard it is to learn to do their job they tell you that it takes lots of experience and they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans it takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people at ted brilliance is rampant it's scary the good news is you don't need to be brilliant to be wise the bad news is that without wisdom now i hope that we all know this there's a sense in which it's obvious and yet let me tell you a little story it's a story about lemonade nor did he tell us trust us trust your country invest invest invest instead what he told us was to put aside childish things a dad and his seven year old son were watching a detroit tigers game at the ballpark his son asked him for some lemonade and dad went to the concession stand to buy it all they had was mike 's hard lemonade which was five percent alcohol dad being an academic had no idea that mike 's hard lemonade and they were ready to let the kid go but not so fast the wayne county child welfare protection agency said no and the child was sent to a foster home for three days at that point can the child go home well a judge said yes but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel after two weeks i'm happy to report the family was reunited but the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing we hate to do it but we have to follow procedure how do things like this scott simon who told this story on npr said rules and procedures may be dumb but they spare you from thinking and to be fair rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lax and they let a child go back to an abusive household fair enough when things go wrong as of course they do we reach for two tools to try to fix them one tool we reach for is rules better ones more of them the second tool we reach for is incentives better ones more of them what else after all is there we can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis regulate regulate regulate fix the incentives fix the incentives fix the incentives the truth is and he appealed to virtue virtue is an old fashioned word it seems a little out of place that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job how could you even write a rule that go the janitors to do what they did and would you pay them a bonus for being it's preposterous on its face and what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules rules and incentives may make things better in the short run but they create a downward spiral moral skill is chipped away by an over reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisations and moral will is undermined by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing second no doubt more familiar to you is the nature of modern american education scripted lock step curricula here 's an example from chicago kindergarten reading and enjoying literature and words that begin with b the bath assemble students on a rug and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water say in a cutting edge environment like this one and besides some of you might be wondering what the hell does it mean let me begin with an example seventy five items in this script to teach a twenty five page picture book all over chicago in every kindergarten class in the city every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day we know why these scripts are there we don't trust the judgment of teachers enough to let them loose on their own don't get me wrong we need rules jazz musicians need some notes most of them need some notes on the page we need more rules for the bankers god knows but too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising and as a result they lose their gifts or worse they stop playing altogether now how about incentives they seem cleverer if you have one reason for doing something and i give you a second reason for doing the same thing it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you're more likely to do it right well not always sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complimenting and they make people less likely to do it i'll just give you one example because time is racing in switzerland back about fifteen years ago they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps there was going to be a national referendum they knew it was dangerous they thought it would reduce their property values but it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens the psychologists asked other people a slightly different question they said if we paid you six weeks salary this is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up on the screen and all of the every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community two reasons it's my responsibility and i'm getting paid instead of fifty percent saying yes twenty five percent said yes what happens is that the second this introduction of incentive gets us so that instead of asking what is my responsibility all we ask is what serves my interests when incentives don't work when ceos ignore the long term health of their companies in pursuit of short term gains that will lead to massive bonuses the response is always the same get smarter incentives the truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough any incentive system can be subverted by bad will we need incentives people have to make a living but excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word it causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality barack obama said before he was inaugurated we must ask not just is it profitable but is it right items on it are unremarkable they're the things you would expect mop the floors sweep them empty the trash restock the cabinets it may be a little surprising and we certainly see it in the world of business it is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work so what can we do a few sources of hope we ought to try to re moralize work one way not to do it teach more ethics courses there is no better way to show people that you're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course what to do instead one celebrate moral exemplars acknowledge when you go to law school that a little how many things there are but it's not surprising what they are but the one thing i want you to notice about them is don't know how many of you remember this another moral hero fifteen years ago aaron feuerstein who was the head of malden mills in massachussetts they made polartec the factory burned down three thousand employees he kept go maybe on paper our company is worth less to wall street but i can tell you it's worth more we're doing fine just at this ted we heard talks from several moral heroes two were particularly inspiring to me one was ray anderson who turned turned you know a part of the evil empire into a zero footprint or almost zero footprint business why because it was the right thing to do and a bonus he 's discovering is he 's actually going to make even more money his employees are inspired by the effort why because there happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do yesterday we heard willie smits talk about even though this is a very long list there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings not one but most important to make it work and he emphasized this is that it took knowing the people in the communities unless the people you're working with,1
39,BarrySchwartz_2010S.sph.wav,he was married he had a third kid on the way he suffered from ptsd in addition to the bad and recurrent nightmares and he had started using marijuana to ease some of the symptoms he was only able to get part time work because of his back and so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table and take care of his family so he started selling marijuana he was busted in a drug sweep his family was kicked out of their apartment and the welfare system was threatening to take away his kids under normal sentencing procedures judge russell would have had little choice but to sentence pettengill to serious jail time as a drug but judge russell did have an alternative and that's because he was in a special court he was in a court called the veterans court in the veterans court this was the first of its kind in the united states judge russell created the veterans court it was a court only for veterans who had broken the law and he had created it exactly because mandatory sentencing laws were taking the judgment out of no one wanted non violent offenders and especially non violent offenders who were veterans to boot to be thrown into prison they wanted to do something about what we all know namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system and what the veterans court did was it treated each criminal as an individual tried to get inside their problems to fashion responses to their crimes that helped them to rehabilitate themselves and didn't forget about them once the judgment was made stayed with them followed up on them made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan had been jointly developed to get them over the hump there are now twenty two cities that have veterans courts like this why has the idea well one reason is that judge russell has now seen one hundred and eight vets in his veterans court if things aren't going right the first response is let 's make more rules as of february of this year and out of one hundred and eight guess how many have gone back through the revolving door of justice into prison none anyone would glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record so here 's is a system and it seems to be catching there's a banker who created a for profit community bank that encouraged bankers i know this is hard to believe encouraged bankers who worked there to do well by doing good for their low income clients the bank helped finance the rebuilding of what was otherwise a dying community though their loan recipients were high risk by ordinary standards the default rate was extremely low the bank was profitable the bankers stayed with their loan recipients they didn't make loans and then sell the loans they serviced the loans they made sure that their loan recipients were staying up with their payments banking hasn't always been the way we read about it now in the newspapers let 's set up a set of detailed procedures to make sure that people will do the right thing give teachers scripts even goldman sachs once used to serve clients before it turned into an institution that serves only itself banking wasn't always this way and it doesn't have to be this way so there are examples like this in medicine doctors at harvard who are trying to transform medical education so that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion and loss of empathy which characterizes most medical students in the course of their medical training and the way they do it is to give third year medical students patients who they follow for an entire year so the patients are not organ systems and they're not diseases they're people people with lives and in order to be an effective doctor you need to treat people who have lives and not just disease in addition to which there's an enormous amount of back and forth mentoring of one student by another of all the students by the doctors and the result is a generation we hope of doctors who do have time for the people they treat we'll see so there are lots of examples like this that we talk about each of them shows that it is possible to build on and nurture character and keep a profession true to its proper mission what aristotle would have called its and ken and i believe that this is what practitioners actually want people want to be allowed to be virtuous to follow in the classroom so even if they don't know what they're doing and don't care about the welfare of our kids as long as they follow the scripts our kids will get educated they want to have permission to do the right thing they don't want to feel like they need to take a shower to get the moral grime off their bodies everyday when they come home from work aristotle thought that practical wisdom was the key to happiness and he was right there's now a lot of research being done in psychology on what makes people happy and the two things that jump out in study after study i know this will come as a shock to all of you the two things that matter most to happiness are love and work rules and incentives don't tell you how to be a good friend how to be a good parent how to be a good spouse or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher rules and incentives are no substitutes for wisdom indeed we argue there is no substitute for wisdom and so practical wisdom does not require heroic acts of self sacrifice on the part of practitioners in giving us the will in fees more and more rules to protect us against an indifferent uncaring set of institutions we have to deal with or or maybe and in addition to rules let 's see if we can come up with some really clever incentives so that even if the people we deal with don't particularly want to serve our interests it is in their interest to serve our the magic incentives that will get people to do the right thing even out of pure selfishness so we offer teachers bonuses if the kids they teach score passing grades on these big test scores that are used to evaluate the quality of school systems rules and incentives sticks and carrots we passed a bunch of rules to regulate the financial industry in response to the recent collapse there's the dodd frank act there's the new consumer financial protection agency that is temporarily being headed through the backdoor by elizabeth warren maybe these rules will actually improve the way these financial services companies behave we'll see in addition we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them more interested in serving the long term interests even of their own companies rather than securing short term profits so if we find just the right incentives they'll do the right thing as i said selfishly and if we come up with the right rules and regulations they won 't drive us all over a cliff and ken and i certainly know that you need to reign in the bankers if there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse it is that but what we believe and what we argue in the book is that there is no set of rules no matter how detailed no matter how specific no matter how carefully monitored and enforced there is no set of rules that will get us what we need why because bankers are smart people and like water they will find cracks in any set of rules you design a set of rules that will make sure that the particular reason why the financial system almost collapsed again it is naive beyond description to think that having blocked this source of financial collapse you have blocked all possible so there is among many people certainly me and most of the people i talk to a kind of collective dissatisfaction with the way things are working with the way our institutions sources of financial collapse so it's just a question of waiting for the next one and then marveling at how we could have been so stupid as not to protect ourselves against that what we desperately need beyond or along with better rules and reasonably smart incentives is we need virtue we need character we need people who want to do the right thing and in particular the virtue that we need most of all is the virtue that aristotle called practical wisdom practical wisdom is the moral will to do the right thing and the moral skill to figure out what the right thing is so aristotle was very in watching how the craftsmen around him worked and he was impressed at how they would improvise novel solutions to novel problems problems that they hadn't anticipated so one example is he sees these stonemasons working on the isle of lesbos and they need to measure out round columns well if you think about it it's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler so what do they do they fashion a novel solution to the problem they created a ruler that bends what we would call these days a tape measure a flexible rule a rule that bends and aristotle said hah they appreciated that sometimes to design rounded columns you need to bend the dealing with other people demands a kind of flexibility that no set of rules can encompass wise people know when and how to bend the rules wise people know how to improvise the way my co author ken and i talk about it they are kind of like jazz musicians the rules are like the notes on the page our kids teachers seem to be failing them you started but then you dance around the notes on the page coming up with just the right combination for this particular moment with this particular set of fellow players so for aristotle the kind of rule bending rule exception finding and improvisation that you see in skilled craftsmen is exactly what you need to be a skilled moral craftsman and in interactions with people almost all the time it is this kind of our doctors don't know who the hell we are and they don't have enough time for us we certainly can't trust the bankers if you are a rule bender and an improviser mostly to serve yourself what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people so it matters that you do this wise practice in the service of others and not in the service of yourself and so the will to do the right thing is just as important as the moral skill of improvisation and exception finding together they comprise practical wisdom which aristotle thought was the master virtue so i'll give you an example of wise practice in action it's the case of michael he had a pretty low wage job he was supporting his wife and a child and the child was going to parochial school then he lost his job he panicked about being able to support his family one night he drank a little too much and he robbed a cab driver and we certainly can't trust the brokers they almost brought the entire financial system down and even as we do our stole dollar fifty he robbed him at gunpoint it was a toy gun he got he had never committed a crime before he was a responsible husband and father he had been faced with desperate circumstances all this would do is wreck a family and so she improvised a sentence eleven months and not only that but release every day to go to work it turned out the prosecutor was not happy that judge forer ignored the sentencing guidelines and sort of invented her own and so he appealed and he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery all too often we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing and doing the expected thing or the required thing or the profitable he did after all have a toy gun the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery is five years had to follow the law and by the way this appeal went through after he had finished serving his sentence so he was out and working and michael disappeared so that is an example both of wisdom in practice and the subversion of wisdom by rules that are meant of course to make things better now consider miss dewey miss dewey 's a teacher in a texas elementary school she found herself listening to a consultant one day who was trying to help teachers boost the test scores of the kids so that the school would reach the elite category in percentage of kids passing big tests all these schools in texas compete with one another to achieve these milestones and there are bonuses and various other treats that come if you beat the other schools don't waste your time on kids who can't pass the test no matter what you do third don't waste your time on kids who moved into the district too late for their scores to be counted focus all of your time and attention on the kids who are on the bubble the so called bubble kids kids where your intervention can get them just maybe over the line from failing to passing so miss dewey heard this and she shook her head in despair while fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on and nodding approvingly it's like they were about to go play a football game for miss dewey this isn't why she became a teacher thing so everywhere we look pretty much across the board we worry that the people we depend on don't really have our interests at heart now ken and i are not naive and we understand that you need to have rules you need to have incentives people have to make a living but the problem with relying on rules and incentives is that they demoralize professional activity and they demoralize professional activity in two senses first they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity judge forer quits and miss dewey in completely disheartened and second they demoralize the activity itself the very practice is demoralized and the practitioners are demoralized it creates people when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing it creates people who are addicted to incentives that is to say it creates people who only do things for incentives now the striking thing about this is that psychologists have known this for thirty years psychologists have known about negative consequences of incentivizing everything for thirty years we know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures they stop caring about the drawing and care only about the reward if you reward kids for reading books they stop caring about what's in the books and only care about how long they are if you reward teachers for kids test scores they stop caring about educating and only care about test preparation if you were to reward doctors for doing more procedures which is the current system they would do more if instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures they will do fewer what we want of course is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures and do the right amount for the right reason namely to serve the welfare of their patients psychologists have known this for decades and it's time for policymakers to start or if they do have our interests at heart we worry that they don't know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to paying attention and listen to psychologists a little bit instead of economists and it doesn't have to be this way we think ken and i that there are real sources of hope we identify one set of people in all of these practices who we call canny outlaws these are people who being forced to operate in a system that demands rule following and creates incentives find away around the rules find a way to subvert the rules so there are teachers who have these scripts to follow and they know that if they follow these scripts the kids will learn nothing and so what they do is they follow the scripts but they follow the scripts at double time and squirrel away little bits of extra time during which they teach in the way that they actually know is so these are little ordinary everyday heroes and they're incredibly admirable but there's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity in the face of a system that either roots them out or grinds them down so canny outlaws are better than nothing but it's hard to imagine any canny outlaw sustaining that for an indefinite period of time more hopeful and we talk about several one in particular is a judge named robert russell and one day he was faced with the case of gary pettengill pettengill was a twenty three year old vet,1
40,BartWeetjens_2010X.sph.wav,talking ninety five now princess diana is announcing on tv that landmines form a structural barrier to any development which is really true as long as these devices are there or there is suspicion of landmines you can't really enter into the land actually there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable because aren't they vermin well actually rats are contrary to what most people think about them rats are left and right there the animal finds a mine it scratches on the soil and the animal comes back for a food reward very very simple very sustainable in this environment here the animal gets its food reward and that's how it works very very simple i'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey extraordinarily rewarding journey actually which brought me into now why would you use rats rats have been used since the fifties last century in all kinds of experiments rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species they're extremely sensitive to smell moreover they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about how do we communicate with rats well don't talk rat but we have a clicker a standard method for animal training which you see there a clicker which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors first of all we associate the click sound with a food reward which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe once the animal knows click food click food click food so click is food we bring it in a cage with and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed and to do that for five seconds five seconds which is long for a rat once the animal knows this we make the task a bit more difficult it learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes up to ten holes then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets in the next step training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis there's a number of mines placed blindly and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the just like dogs by the way maybe one slight difference we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog this is our team in mozambique one tanzanian trainer who transfers the skills to these three mozambican fellows and you should see the pride in the eyes of these people they have a skill which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid moreover this small team together with of course you need the heavy vehicles and the manual deminers to follow up with this small investment in a rat capacity we have demonstrated in mozambique that we can reduce the cost price per sq meter up to sixty percent of what is currently normal two dollars per sq meter we do it at one point one eight and we can still bring that price down question of scale as a child i had two passions one was a passion for rodents if you can bring in more rats we can actually make the output even bigger we have a demonstration site in mozambique eleven african governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology they have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the great lakes region and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines but let me bring you to a very different problem and there's about six thousand people last year that walked on a landmine but last year almost one point nine million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection especially in africa where t b and hiv are strongly linked there is a huge common problem microscopy the standard who procedure reached from forty to sixty percent reliability in tanzania the numbers don't lie forty five percent of people t b patients all kinds of rats mice hamsters gerbils squirrels you name it i bred it and i sold them to b secondary infections and if however you are detected very early diagnosed early treatment can start and even in hiv positives it makes sense you can actually cure t b even in hiv positives so in our common language dutch the name for which etymologically refers to the smell of tar already the old chinese and actually published documented that t b can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients so what we did is we collected some samples just as a way of testing from hospitals trained rats on them and this works and wonder well we can reach eighty nine percent sensitivity eighty six percent specificity using how it works and really this is a generic technology how does it work you have a cassette with of a second to discriminate the scent so it goes extremely fast here it's already at the third sample i also had a passion for africa growing up in a multicultural environment we had african students in the house and i learned about their stories which patients are positive which are like this provided that you have rats and we have now currently twenty five tuberculosis rats a cage like this operating throughout the day can process one thousand six hundred and eighty samples five clinics in dar es salaam on a population of five hundred thousand people where fifteen thousand reported to get we were able to increase case detection rates by over thirty percent throughout last year we've been different backgrounds dependency on imported know how goods services exuberant cultural diversity depending on which intervals you take we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in dar es salaam between thirty and forty percent so this is really considerable knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to fifteen people healthy people per year you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives at least our hero rats have saved lots of lives the way forward for us is now to standardize this technology and there are simple things like for instance we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds so to standardize this also to standardize the and to semi automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people to conclude there are also other applications at the horizon here is a first prototype of our camera rat which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on this is in a prototype stage we don't have a working system here yet to conclude i would actually like to say you may think this is about rats these projects but in the end it is about people it is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks and doing that with a local resource plenty available so something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you whether they are environmental technological animal or human and to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable work thank you very much i started working in the industry but i wasn't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear extracting and manufacturing mode i quit my job to focus on the real world problem,1
41,BartonSeaver_2010Z.sph.wav,but what if we eat only in the green list you've got pole caught yellowfin tuna here comes from sustainable stocks pole caught no bycatch great for fishermen lots of money supporting local economies but it's a lion of the sea it's a top predator what's the context of this meal am i sitting down in a steakhouse to a sixteen oz portion of do i do this three times a week i might still be in the green list but i'm not doing myself or you or the oceans any favors we have to have a context a gauge for our actions in all this example i've heard that red wine is great for my health and minerals heart healthy that's great i love red wine i'm going to drink so much of it i'm going to be so healthy well how many bottles is it before you tell me that i have a problem so the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs restorative seafood might best be represented not by jaws or by flipper or the gordon 's fisherman but rather by the jolly green giant we must continue to eat the best seafood possible if at all but we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables the best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half shell with a bottle of tabasco and lemon wedges it comes in a five ounce portion of tilapia breaded with dijon mustard this is an easy sell and the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood walmart jamie oliver so i think we have this whole eating this wrong and so i think it's time we change what we expect from our food sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand so let 's start there green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters just because it comes from a green source doesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the we have eco friendly shrimp we can make them we have that technology but we can never have any eco friendly all you can eat shrimp buffet it doesn't work heart healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood while we try and manage declining marine populations the media's recommending increased consumption of seafood restorative options this is what we need to favor this is what the green list says but this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment i have a recipe for you it pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean so here we go start with a sixteen oz portion of big fish to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem it allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we're also so fortunate to eat so what do we call this i think we call it restorative seafood i expect a lot from food i expect health and joy and family and community i expect that producing ingredients preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests i was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook and he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents i remember well the meals of my childhood they were i get sick when i go to steakhouses i get the meat sweats it's like a hangover from protein it's disgusting but of all the dire news that you'll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans i have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right eat your vegetables it's pretty straightforward so what are we looking for in a meal well for health i'm looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body for joy i'm looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance for family i'm looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories for community though we start at the very beginning there's no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact so try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it so if we all take only what we need then we can begin to share the rest we can begin to celebrate we can begin to restore where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain restorative is the ability to replenish and progress restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean we need to savor vegetables we need to savor smaller portions of seafood and we need to save dinner thank you as a resource suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency it is a more hopeful it is a more human and is a more useful way of understanding our environment guides standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world are very handy they're a wonderful tool green yellow and red lists seafood species the association is very easy buy green don't buy red think twice about yellow but in my mind it's really not enough to just eat green list we can't sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red,1
42,BeauLotto_2009G.sph.wav,what i want to talk about is not that context is everything but why is context everything because it's answering that question that tells us not only we see what we do but who we are as individuals and who we are as a society now can any of you see the predator that's about to jump out at you and if you haven't seen it yet you're dead right can anyone see it anyone no now let 's see the surfaces according the quality of light that they reflect and now you see it so color to see the similarities and differences between surfaces according to the full spectrum of light that they reflect but what you've just done is in many respects mathematically impossible why because as berkeley tells us we have no direct access to our physical world other than through our senses and the light that falls on to our eyes is determined by multiple things in the world not only the color of objects i want to start with a game but also the color of their illumination and the color of the space between us and those objects you vary any one of those parameters and you'll change the color of the light that falls to win this game all you have to do is see the reality that's in front of you as it really is all right so we have two panels here of colored dots they are identical in every single way identical in shape size spectral content they are the same as far as your eye is concerned and yet they come from completely different sources the one on the right comes from a yellow surface in shadow oriented facing the left viewed through a pinkish medium the one on the left comes from an orange surface under direct light facing to the right viewed through a sort of a blueish medium completely different meanings giving rise to the exact same retinal information and yet it's only the retinal information that we get so how on earth do we even see so if you remember anything in this next eighteen minutes remember this that the light that falls on to your eye sensory information is meaningless because it could mean literally anything and what's true for sensory information is true for information generally there is no inherent meaning in information it's what we do with that information that matters so how do we see well we see by learning to see so the brain evolved the mechanisms for finding patterns finding relationships in information and associating those relationships with a behavioral meaning a significance by interacting with the world we're very aware of this in the form of more cognitive attributes like language so i'm going to give you some letter strings and i want you to read them out for me if you can and one of those dots is the same in the two panels okay and you have to tell me which one now narrow it down to so you don't do it again so let me show you how quickly our brains can redefine normality even at the simplest thing the brain does which is color so if i could have the lights down up here i want you to first notice that those two desert scenes are physically the same one is simply the flipping of the other okay now i want you to look at that dot between the green and the red okay and i want you to stare at that dot don't look anywhere else and we're going to look at that for about thirty seconds which is a bit of a killer in an eighteen minute talk really want you to learn and i'll tell you don't look anywhere else and i'll tell you what's happening inside your head i tell you i want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes so why don't you do that now have the lights up again i take it from your response they don't look the same right why because is seeing that same information as if the right one is still under red light and the left one is still under green light that's your new normal so what does this mean for context it means that i can take these two identical squares and i can put them in light and dark surrounds and now the one on the dark surround looks lighter than the one on the what's significant is not simply the light and dark surrounds that matter it's what those light and dark surrounds meant for your behavior in the past so i'll show you what i mean here we have that exact same illusion we have two identical tiles on the left one in a dark surround one in a light surround and the same thing over on the right notice that on the left the two tiles look nearly completely opposite one very white and one very dark alright whereas on the right the two tiles look nearly the same and yet there is still one on a dark surround and one on a light surround why because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow it would have to be more reflective just the laws of physics so you see it that way whereas on the right the information is consistent with those two tiles being under the same light if they are under the same light reflecting the same amount of then they must be equally reflective so you see it that way bright orange tile at the side that is your perceptual reality the physical reality is that those two tiles are the same gray one really okay how many people think it's the green one here you see four gray tiles on your left seven gray tiles on the right i'm not going to change those tiles at all but i'm going to reveal the rest of the and see what happens to your perception the four blue tiles on the left are gray the seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray they are the same okay don't believe me let 's watch it again what's true for color is also true for complex perceptions of motion so here we have let 's turn this around a diamond and what i'm going to do is i'm going to hold it here and and for all of you you'll see it probably spinning this direction now i want you to keep looking at it move your eyes around blink maybe close one eye and suddenly it will flip and start spinning the opposite direction yes raise your hand if you got that yes keep blinking every time you blink it will switch alright so i can ask you which direction is it rotating how do you know your brain doesn't know because both are equally likely so depending on where it looks it flips between the two possibilities and how many people think it's the orange one sees illusions does the most complicated things that even our most sophisticated computers can't do so in my lab we of course work on bumblebees because we can completely control their experience and see how that alters the architecture of their brain and we do this in what we call the bee matrix and here you have the hive you can see the queen bee that large bee in the middle there those are all her daughters the eggs and they go back and forth between this and the arena via this tube and you'll see one of the bees come right we pull them out put them in the fridge and they fall asleep and then you can superglue little numbers on them and sometimes they learn not to go to the blue but to go to where the other bees go so they copy each other they can count to five they can recognize faces and here she comes down the ladder and she'll come into the hive find an empty honey pot and throw up and that's honey let 's find out what the reality is here is the orange one now remember and the answer to the question is no those are actually blue flowers but those are blue flowers under green light so they are using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle which is exactly what we do so illusions are often used especially in art in the words of a more contemporary artist to demonstrate the fragility of our senses okay this is complete rubbish the senses aren't fragile and if they were we wouldn't be here instead the brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past and how we see is by continually redefining so how can we take this incredible capacity of plasticity of the brain and get people to experience their world one of the ways we do in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound and we enable people to hear their visual world here is the green one and here is the gray one and they can navigate the world using here is david in the right and he is holding a camera on the left is what his camera sees and you'll see there is a line a faint line going across that image that line is broken up into thirty two squares in each square we calculate the average color and then we just simply translate that into sound and now he 's going to turn around and find a plate on the he finds it amazing right so not only can we create a prosthetic for the visually impaired but we can also investigate so working with kids they created images thinking about what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them and then we translated these images and this is one of those images and this is a six year old child composing now what does all this mean what this suggests is that no one is an outside observer of nature okay we are not defined by our central properties by the bits that make us up defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment by our ecology and that ecology is necessarily relative historical and so what i'd like to finish with is this over here because what i've been trying to do is really celebrate uncertainty because i think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding so if some of you are still feeling a bit too certain i'd like to do this one so if we have the lights down so this pretty amazing actually isn't it because nearly every living system has evolved the ability to detect light in one way or another so for us what we have here can everyone see twenty five purple surfaces on your left right now you can see that changes the light that's coming through there right because now the light is going yellowish filter and then a purplish filter i'm going to do this opposite on the left here i'm going to put the middle nine under purplish light now some of you will notice that the consequence is that the light coming through those middle nine on the right or your left is exactly the same as the light coming through the middle nine on your right agreed yes okay so they are physically the same let 's pull the covers off remember you know the middle nine are exactly the same do they look the same no the question is is that an illusion and i'll leave you with that so thank you very much seeing color is one of the simplest things the brain does and yet even at this most fundamental level context is everything,1
43,BeckyBlanton_2009G.sph.wav,but then the anger and the depression about my father 's death set in my freelance job ended and i had to get a full time job to pay the bills it became impossible to park anywhere used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops or i washed up in food rotted in the heat ice in my ice chest melted within hours and it was pretty miserable i couldn't afford to find an apartment or couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me to have the rottweiler and the cat i'm a writer and a journalist and i'm also an insanely curious person and i refused to give them up so i stayed in the van outside my van at night i used a bucket a trash bag as a toilet a different place every night so i would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police i didn't always succeed but out of control of my life which i went from being a talented writer and journalist so in twenty two years as a journalist i've learned how to do a lot of new things i hadn't changed my i q hadn't dropped my talent my integrity my values and as depressed as anyone in line i just wasn't drunk or high you aren't homeless why are you really here and three years ago other homeless people didn't see me as homeless but i did a reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal and i remember thinking if i killed myself no one would notice a friend told me shortly after that that she had heard that tim russert a nationally renowned journalist had been talking about me on national an essay i'd written about my father the year before he died was in tim 's new book and he was doing the talk show circuit and he was talking about my writing and when i realized that tim russert i became one of the working homeless former moderator of meet the press was talking about my writing while i was living in a van in a wal mart parking lot i started laughing you should too i started laughing i quit my job as a newspaper editor by the summer of the following year i was a working journalist i was winning awards i was living in my own apartment i was no longer homeless and i was no longer invisible thousands of people work full and part time jobs and live in their cars after my father died in february of that same year and decided to travel so the homeless the working homeless primarily remain invisible but if you ever meet one engage them encourage them and offer them hope the human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope or what their life situation is at any given time three years ago i was living in a van in a wal mart parking lot and today i'm speaking at ted hope always always finds a way his death hit me pretty hard and there were a lot of things that i wanted to feel and deal with while i was doing that i've camped my whole life and i decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip so that society equates living in a permanent structure even a shack with having value as a person two i failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality if we let it three i failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude not a lifestyle i showered in campgrounds i ate out regularly and i had time to relax and to grieve,1
44,BenCameron_2010X.sph.wav,now competes with between three and five thousand different marketing messages a typical citizen see every single day we now know in fact that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time five yeas ago gen x 'ers spent twenty point seven hours online and tv the majority on tv gen y 'ers spent even more twenty three point eight hours the majority online and now a typical university entering student arrives at college already having spent twenty thousand hours online and an additional ten thousand hours playing video games we're afraid that technology has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption thanks to the internet we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it delivered to our own doorstep i am a cultural omnivore one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an ipod an ipod that contains wagner and mozart pop diva christina aquilera we can shop at three in the morning or eight at night ordering jeans tailor made for our unique body types expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts which have set curtain times set venues attendant inconveniences of travel parking and the like simply cannot meet and we're all acutely aware what's it going to mean in the future when we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars for a symphony opera or ballet ticket cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet twenty four hours a day for ninety nine cents a song or for free these are enormous questions for those of us who work in this terrain but as particular as they feel to us we know we're not all of us are engaged in a seismic fundamental realignment of culture and communications a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry the magazine industry the book and publishing industry and more saddled in the performing arts as we are by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction and streaming locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the nineteenth century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues where we charge exorbitant prices many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of tower records and ask ourselves are we next everyone i talk to in performing arts resonates to the words of adrienne rich who in doctoreams of a common language wrote we are out in a country that has no language no laws whatever we do together is pure invention the maps they now rather than saying that we're on the brink of our own annihilation i prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental reformation a reformation like the religious reformation of the sixteenth century the arts reformation like the religious reformation is spurred in part by technology with indeed the printing press really leading the charge on the religious reformation both reformations were predicated on fractious discussion internal self doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models and at heart both reformations i think were asking the questions who 's entitled to practice how are they entitled to practice and indeed do we need anyone to intermediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual chris anderson someone i trust you all know editor and chief of wired magazine and author of the long tail really was the first for me to nail a lot of this he wrote a long time ago you know thanks to the invention of the internet web technology mini cams and more the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history and now who in this room doesn't know a fourteen year old hard at work on her second third or fourth movie similarly the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history again in the warner bros rko did that for you now go to youtube facebook you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own this double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market a time when anyone is a potential author but the number of arts participants people who write poetry who sing songs who perform in church choirs is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations and one who lives for my home theater a home theater where i devour dvds video on demand and a lot of television this group others have called the pro ams amateur artists doing work at a professional level you see them on youtube in dance competitions film festivals and more they are radically expanding our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions ultimately we now live in a world defined not by consumption but by participation they currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity not opulence of dignity and they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home but to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community is by far too short sighted and indeed while we've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional for me law and order svu tine fey and thirty rock and judge judy the people are real the cases are real the rulings are the single most exciting development in the last five to ten years has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist the professional artist who works not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage but most frequently around women 's rights or human rights or on global warming issues or aids relief for more not out of economic necessity but out of a deep organic conviction that the work that she or he is called to do cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment today 's dance world is not defined solely by the royal winnipeg ballet or the national ballet of canada but by liz lerman 's dance exchange a multi generational professional dance company whose dancers range in age from eighteen to eighty two and who work with genomic scientists to embody the dna strand and with nuclear physicists at cern today 's professional theater community is defined not only the shaw and stratford festivals but by the cornerstone theater of los angeles a collective of artists that after nine eleven brought together ten different religious communities the muslim the jewish even the native american and the gay and lesbian communities of faith helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play where they explored the differences in their faith and found commonality as an important first step toward cross today 's performers like rhodessa jones work in women 's prisons helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration while today 's playwrights and directors work with young gangs to find alternate channels to violence and more and i'm convinced a lot of you probably share my passions especially my passion for judge judy and more and indeed i think rather than being annihilated the performing arts are posed on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been for a long time we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town and absolutely i hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community and you'd fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us but i'm a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life empathy to articulate change to motivate others the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter especially as we all must confront the fallacy of a market only orientation uninformed by social conscience we must seize and celebrate the power of the arts to shape our individual and national characters and especially characters of the young people who all too often are subjected bombardment of sensation rather than digested experience and in a context of analysis where the thing we hear most repeatedly day in day out in the united states in every train station every bus station every plane station is ladies and gentlemen please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest you when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion the arts whatever they do whenever they call us together invite us a passion for the live professional performing arts performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire yes but jazz as well modern dance opera theater and to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity god knows if we ever needed that capacity in human history we need it you know we're bound together not i think by technology entertainment and design but by common cause we work to promote healthy vibrant societies to ameliorate human suffering to promote a more thoughtful substantive i salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work whatever your purpose may be i promise you the hand of the doris duke charitable foundation is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come and i thank you for your kindness and your patience in listening to me this afternoon thank you and more and more you know frankly it's a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology while we initially heralded the internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems we now realize that the internet is if anything too effective in that regard depending on who you read an arts organization or an artist who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket buyer,1
45,BenDunlap_2007.sph.wav,meal and then they got into a furious argument and what they were arguing about was this whether the second harry potter movie was as good as the first and doctor robicsek reeled back in his chair but quickly gathered his wits leaned forward and said well that is true but i'll bet you went to the movie with a grandchild i did conceded mister milliken aha said doctor robicsek i went to the movie all by myself and i realized in this moment of revelation that what these two men were revealing was the secret of their extraordinary success each in his own right and it lay precisely in that insatiable curiosity that irrepressible desire to know no matter what the subject no matter what the cost even at a time when the keepers of the doomsday clock are willing to bet even this is what i'm passionate about it is precisely this it is this undaunted appetite for learning and experience no matter how risible no matter how esoteric no matter how seditious it might seem this defines the imagined futures of our fellow hungarians robicsek and teszler and bartok as it does my own as it does i suspect that of everybody here to which i need only add this is our task we know it will be hard it seems to me that this hungarian presence in my life is difficult to account for but ultimately i ascribe it to an admiration for people with a complex moral awareness with a heritage of guilt and defeat matched by defiance and bravado it's not a typical mindset for most americans but it is perforce typical of virtually all hungarians so yo napot i went back to south carolina after some fifteen years amid the alien corn at the tail end of the nineteen sixties with the reckless condescension of that era thinking i would save my people napot pacak which as somebody here must surely know means what 's up guys in magyar that peculiar never mind the fact that they were slow to acknowledge they needed saving i labored in that vineyard for a quarter century before i knew nothing about wofford and even less about methodism but i was reassured on the first day that i taught at wofford college to find among the auditors in my classroom a ninety year old hungarian he was a puckish widower whose wife and children were dead and whose grandchildren lived far away in appearance he resembled mahatma gandhi minus the loincloth plus orthopedic boots he was ostracized as a child not because he was a jew his parents weren't very religious anyhow but because he had been born with two club feet a condition which in those days required institutionalization and a succession of painful operations between the ages of one and eleven he went to the commercial business high school as a young man in budapest and there he was as smart as he was modest and he enjoyed a considerable success and after graduation when he went into textile engineering non indo european language spoken by hungarians for which given the fact that cognitive diversity is at least as threatened as biodiversity on this planet the success continued he built one plant after another he married and had two sons he had friends in high places who assured him that he was of great value to the economy he had left instructions to have done he was summoned in the middle of the night by the night watchman at one of his plants but why do you steal from me if you need money you have only to ask the night watchman seeing how things were going and waxing indignant said well we're going to call well maybe he was too trusting because he stayed where he was long after the nazi anschluss in austria and even after the arrests and deportations began in budapest he took the simple precaution of having cyanide capsules placed in lockets that could be worn about the necks of himself and his family but none who entered that death house had ever come out alive and in a twist you would not believe in a steven spielberg film few would have imagined much of a future even a century or two ago but there it is the gauleiter who was overseeing this brutal beating was the very same thief who had stolen socks from mister teszler 's hosiery mill it was a brutal beating and midway through and whispered into mister teszler 's ear no do not take the capsule help is on the way and then resumed the beating but help help was on the way and shortly afterward a car arrived from the swiss embassy they were spirited to safety they were reclassified as yugoslav citizens and they managed to stay one step ahead of their pursuers for the duration of the war surviving burnings and bombings and at the end of the war arrest by the soviets i said somebody here must surely know because despite the fact that there aren't that many hungarians to begin with and the further fact that so far as i know there's not a drop of hungarian blood and then to the center of the textile industry in the american south which as chance would have it was spartanburg south carolina the location of wofford college and there mister teszler began all over again and once again achieved immense success especially after he invented a process for manufacturing a new fabric called double knit and then then in the late nineteen fifties in the aftermath of brown versus board of education when the klan was resurgent all over the south mister teszler said i have heard this talk before and he called his top assistant to him and asked where would you say in this region he was told and shortly afterwards mister teszler received a visit from the white mayor of kings mountain now you should know that at that time the textile industry in the south was notoriously segregated he also received a visit from the leader of the black community a minister who said mister teszler i sure hope you're going to hire some black workers for this new plant of yours he got the same answer you bring the best workers you can find and if they are good enough i will hire them as it happens the black minister did his job better than the white mayor but that's neither here or there misterteszler hired sixteen eight white eight black they were to be his seed group his future foremen he had installed the heavy equipment for his new process in an abandoned store in the vicinity of kings mountain and for two months these sixteen men would live and work together mastering the new process at every critical juncture of my life there has been a hungarian friend or mentor there beside me i even have dreams that take place in landscapes he gathered them together after an initial tour of the facility and asked if there were any questions there was hemming and hawing and shuffling of feet and then one of the white workers stepped forward and said well yeah this place and there's only one place to sleep there's only one place to eat there's only one bathroom is this plant going to be integrated or what two months later when the main plant opened and hundreds of new workers white and black poured in to see the facility for the first time they were met by the sixteen foremen white and black standing shoulder to shoulder the facility and were asked if there were any questions and inevitably the same question arose is this plant integrated or what one of the white foremen stepped you are being paid twice the wages of any other workers in this industry in this region and this is how we do business do you have any other and there were none in one fell swoop mister teszler had integrated the textile industry in that part of the south it was an achievement worthy of mahatma gandhi conducted with the shrewdness of a lawyer and the idealism of a saint his eighties mister teszler having retired from the textile industry adopted wofford college auditing courses every semester and because he had a tendency to kiss anything that moved becoming affectionately known as opi which is as the landscapes of hungarian films especially the early movies of miklos jancso so the faculty decided to honor itself by naming mister teszler professor of the college partly because at that point he had already taken all of the courses of the catalog but mainly he was so wiser than any one of us to me it was immensely reassuring that the presiding spirit of this little methodist college in upstate south carolina was a holocaust survivor from central europe he was indeed but he also had a wonderful sense of humor and once for an interdisciplinary class i was screening the opening segment of ingmar bergman 's the seventh seal as the medieval knight antonius blok returned from the wild goose chase of the crusades and arrived on the rocky shore of sweden only to find the specter of death waiting for him how do i explain this mysterious affinity maybe it's because my native state of south carolina mister teszler sat in the dark with his fellow students and as death opened his cloak to embrace the knight in a ghastly embrace i heard mister teszler 's but it was music that was his greatest passion especially opera and on the first occasion that i visited his house he gave me honor of deciding what piece of music we would listen to and i delighted him by rejecting cavalerria rusticana in favor of bela bartok 's bluebeard 's castle i love bartok 's music as did mister teszler and he had virtually every recording of bartok 's music ever issued and it was at his house that i heard for the first time bartok 's third piano concerto and learned from mister teszler that it had been composed in nearby asheville north carolina in the last year of the composer 's life he was dying of leukemia and he knew it and he dedicated this concerto to his wife dita who was herself a concert pianist and into the slow second movement marked adagio religioso he incorporated the sounds of birdsong that he heard outside his window in what he knew would be his last spring he was imagining a future which is not much smaller than present day hungary once imagined a future for itself as an independent country and as a consequence of that presumption my hometown was burned to the ground by an invading army for her in which he would play no part and clearly clearly this composition is his final statement to to her it was first performed after his death and through her to the world and just as clearly it is saying whenever you hear this it was only after mister teszler 's death that i learned that the marker on the grave of bela bartok in hartsdale new york was paid for by not long before mister teszler a s own death at the age of ninety seven he heard me hold forth on human iniquity i delivered a lecture in which i described history as on the whole a tidal wave of human suffering you human beings are fundamentally good and i made a vow to myself then and there that if this man who had such cause to think otherwise had reached that conclusion i would not presume to differ until he released me from my vow and now he 's dead so i'm stuck with my vow yo napot i thought my skein of hungarian mentors had come to an end but almost immediately i met francis robicsek a hungarian doctor actually a heart surgeon in charlotte north carolina then in his late seventies who had been a pioneer in open heart surgery and tinkering away in his garage behind his house had invented many of the devices that are standard parts of those procedures he 's also a prodigious art collector beginning as an intern in budapest by collecting sixteenth and seventeenth century dutch art and hungarian painting and when he came to this country moving on to spanish colonial art russian icons and finally an experience that has befallen many a hungarian town and village throughout its long and troubled history or maybe it's because when i was a teenager back in the fifties my uncle henry mayan ceramics he 's the author of seven books six of them on mayan ceramics it was he who broke the mayan codex enabling scholars to relate the pictographs on mayan ceramics to the hieroglyphs of the mayan script and doctor robicsek said with obvious pride now for the piece de resistance and he opened the door and we walked into a windowless twenty by twenty foot room with shelves from floor to ceiling and crammed on every shelf his collection of mayan ceramics now i know absolutely nothing about mayan ceramics but i wanted to be as ingratiating as possible so i said but doctor this is absolutely dazzling yes he said that is what the louvre said they would not leave me alone until i let them have a piece but it was not a good one well it occurred to me that i should invite doctor robicsek to lecture at wofford college on what else leonardo da vinci and further i should invite him to meet my oldest trustee who had majored in french history at yale some seventy odd years before and at eighty nine the world 's largest privately owned textile empire with an iron hand his name is roger milliken and milliken agreed and doctor robicsek agreed and doctor robicsek visited and delivered the lecture and it was a dazzling success and afterwards we convened at the president 's house with doctor robicsek on one hand mister milliken on the other and it was only at that moment as we were sitting down to dinner that i recognized the enormity of the risk i had created because to bring these two titans these two masters of the universe together having denounced the ku klux klan and having been bombed for his trouble and had crosses burned in his yard living under death threat took his wife and children to massachusetts for safety and went back to south carolina to,1
46,BenKatchor_2002.sph.wav,come from is is simply the byproduct of a crude mechanical action or is it an imitation of one half a set of sounds we make to express disappointment the often dedental consonant of no indo european language or is it the amplified sound of a synapse firing in the brain of a cockroach in the nineteen fifties they tried their best to muffle this sound with mercury switches and silent knob controls but today these improvements seem somehow inauthentic the click is the modern triumphal clarion proceeding us through life announcing our entry into every lightless room the sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature i'm going to read a few strips these are most of these are from a monthly page i do in and architecture and design magazine it has a deep melancholy ring children don't like it it's why they leave lights on around the house adults find it comforting but wouldn't it be an easy matter to wire a wall switch so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship or the recorded crowing of a rooster the distant peel of thunder thomas edison went through thousands of unlikely substances before he came upon the right one for the filament of his electric lightbulb why have we settled so quickly for the sound of its switch that's the end praise of the taxpayer that so many of the city 's most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom is cause for celebration these one or two story structures designed to yield only enough income to cover the taxes on the land on which they stand were not meant to be permanent buildings yet for one reason or another they have confounded the efforts of developers to be combined into lots suitable for high rise construction although they make no claim to architectural beauty they are in their perfect temporariness a delightful alternative to the large scale structures that might someday take their place called metropolis and the first story is called the faulty switch another beautifully designed new building ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch the most perfect examples occupy corner lots they offer a pleasant respite from the high density development around them a break of light and air an architectural biding of time so buried in signage are these structures that it often takes a moment to distinguish the modern specially constructed taxpayer from its neighbor the small commercial building from an earlier century whose upper floors have been sealed and whose groundfloor space now functions as a taxpayer the few surfaces not covered by signs are often clad in a distinctive dark green gray striated aluminum siding take out sandwich shops film processing drop offs peep shows and necktie stores now these provisional structures have in some cases remained standing for the better part of a human lifetime the temporary building is a triumph of modern industrial organization a healthy sublimation of the urge to build and proof that not every architectural idea need be set in stone that's the end the lap was a platform upon which to place the earthly possessions of the dead thirty cubits from foot to knee it was not until the fourteenth century that an italian painter recognized the lap as a grecian temple upholstered in flesh and cloth over the next two hundred years we see the infant christ go from a sitting to a standing position on the virgin 's lap and then back again every child recapitulates this ascension straddling one or both legs sitting sideways or leaning against the body it's fine during the day when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight but at dusk everything changes the from there to the modern ventriloquist 's dummy is but a brief moment in history you were late for school again this morning the ventriloquist must first make us believe that a small boy is sitting on his lap the illusion of speech follows incidentally what have you got to say for yourself jimmy as adults we admire the lap from a nostalgic distance we have fading memories of that provisional temple erected each time an adult sat down on a crowded bus there was always a to sit children and teenage girls who are most keenly aware of its architectural beauty they understand the structural integrity of a deep avuncular lap as compared to the shaky arangement of a neurotic niece in high heels the relationship between the lap and its owner is direct and intimate i envision a thirty six story four hundred and fifty unit residential high a reason to consider the mental health of any architect before granting an important commission the bathrooms and kitchens will of course have no windows the lap of luxury is an architectural construct of childhood which we seek in vain as adults to employ that's the end the hundreds of hours designing the burnished brass switchplates serves as the temporary resting place for the haverpiece collection of european dried fruit the profound convolutions on the surface of a dried cherry the foreboding sheen of an extra large date do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries where everything was displayed in poorly labeled roach proof bins pears dried in the form of genital organs for his new office tower and then left it to a contractor to install these seventy nine cent switches behind them we know was purchased by maurice haverpiece a wealthy prune juice bottler and consolidated to form the core collection as an art form it lies somewhere between still life painting and plumbing the rest of the collection remains here stored in plain brown paper bags until funds can be raised to build a permanent museum and study center a shoe made of apricot leather for the daughter of a where to reach when we enter a dark room we automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward but the sound we are greeted with as the room is bathed in the simulated glow of late afternoon light recalls to mind a dirty men 's room in the rear of a greek coffee shop this sound colors our first impression of any room it can't be helped but where does this sound commonly described as a click,1
47,BenSaunders_2005.sph.wav,and scott the british guy captain scott scott had sort of ponies and some tractors and a few dogs all of which went wrong and scott and his team of four people ended up on foot i have a school report i was thirteen years old and it's framed above my desk at home it says ben lacks sufficient impetus to achieve anything we started running very low on food we were both pretty hungry losing lots of weight some very unusual weather conditions very difficult ice conditions we had decidedly low tech communications we couldn't afford a satellite phone so we had hf radio you can see two ski poles sticking out of the a wire dangling down either side that was our hf radio antenna we had less than two hours two way communication with the outside world in two months we spoke to the russian helicopter pilots on the radio and they said look boys you've run out of time we've got to pick you up and i felt that i had of this expedition and i got back to heathrow my mum was there my brother was there my granddad was there had in a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition and lying on my mum 's sofa day in day out watching daytime tv one and a half times the size of america five and a half thousand square miles more than two thousand people have climbed everest twelve people have stood on the moon including me only four people have skied solo to the north pole and i think the reason for that my brother sent me a text message an sms it's it was a quote from the simpsons it said you tried your hardest and failed miserably the lesson is don't even try three years i did eventually get off the sofa and start planning another expedition this time i wanted to go right across on my own this time from russia at the top of the map reason this was what i wanted to have a crack at but i knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece let alone make it across to canada i had to take a radical approach and the expedition started in february last year big support team we had a film crew a couple of logistics people with us the next bit we'd chartered a pretty elderly russian plane to fly us up to a town called khatanga which was the sort of last bit of civilization we got to khatanga i think the joke is that khatanga isn't the end of the world but you can see it from loaded up the helicopters two helicopters flying in tandem dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice to make things worse you can just see the white dot up at the top right hand side of the screen that's a full moon because we'd been held up in russia of course the full moon brings the highest and lowest tides thank you i think the reason for that is that it's it's well it's as chris said bonkers it's a journey that is right at the limit of human i didn't have a hope in hell i had to pull one leave it and go back and get the other one literally scrambling through what's called pressure ice the ice had been my record was minus two point five miles i got up in the morning took the tent down skied north for seven and a half hours put the tent up and i was two and a half miles further back than when i'd started i literally couldn't keep up with the drift of the ice just appalling oh drifted back about five miles in the last last later in the expedition the problem was no longer the ice it was it also meant if the worst came to the worst i could actually jump in and swim across and drag the sledge over after me some pretty radical technology a radical approach but it worked perfectly another exciting thing we did last year was with communications technology as dangerous as everest it wasn't all high tech this is navigating in what's called a whiteout when you get lots of mist low cloud the wind starts blowing the snow up you i got to the pole on the eleventh of may it took me sixty eight days to get there from russia and there is nothing there there isn't even a pole at the pole there's nothing there purely because it's sea ice it's drifting stick a flag there leave it there pretty soon it will drift off usually towards canada or greenland i knew this but i was expecting something that sat down on my sledge did a sort of video diary piece took a few photos i got my satellite phone out i warmed the battery up in my armpit i dialed three numbers i dialed my mum i dialed my girlfriend i dialed the ceo of my sponsor and i got three the entire planet is rotating beneath my feet the the whole world i finally got through to my mum she was at the queue of the supermarket she started crying i skied on for a week past the pole i wanted to get as close to canada as i could before conditions just got too dangerous to continue this was the last day i had on the ice when i spoke to the my project management team they said look ben conditions are getting too dangerous there are huge areas of open water just south of your position we'd like to pick you up ben could you please look for an airstrip this was the view outside my tent when i had this fateful phone call find it took me thirty six hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip was exactly four hundred and seventy three meters i could measure it with my skis i didn't tell tony that i didn't tell the pilots that i thought it'll have to do it just about worked a pretty dramatic landing the plane actually passed over four times and i was a bit worried it wasn't going to land at all the pilot i knew was called troy i was expecting someone called troy that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy i was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed troy troy was smoking a cigarette on the ice we took a few photos he climbed up the ladder he said just just get in the back he threw his cigarette out as he got on the front and i climbed in the back his i thought god here we go we 're we're this is all or nothing rammed it forwards bounced down the runway just took off one of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge i could see into the cockpit troy battling the controls and he just took one hand off reached back flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit and it was the fasten seat belt sign you can in the traditional sense i'm not skiing along drawing maps everyone knows where the north pole is at the south pole there's a big scientific base there's an airstrip there's a cafe for me this is about exploring human limits about exploring the limits of physiology of psychology and of technology they're the things that excite me scratching the surface of their potential just doing three or four or five percent of what they're truly capable of so on a wider scale i hope that this journey was a chance to inspire other people to think about what they want to do with their potential and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time we each have on this planet the last question what's next as quickly as possible if i have a minute left at the end i'll go into more detail what's next the coldest highest windiest and driest continent on earth,1
48,BenjaminWallace_2008P.sph.wav,eminent and accomplished figures in the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles i think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world i became with the generous backing of a magazine i write for sometimes i decided to sample the very best or most expensive or most coveted item in about a dozen categories which was a very grueling quest as you to play a brief video clip for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them so that's why you're going to see this recurring character which i guess you know communicates to you that i did not think that one was really worth the white truffles one of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world to try this i went to a mario batali restaurant in manhattan del posto the waiter you know came out with the white truffle knob and his shaver and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said you know would signore like the truffles and the charm of white truffles is in their aroma it's not in their taste really it's not in their texture it's in the smell these white that you know their purpose had been served and so i'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me there were several several of these items were disappointments this is soap that's made from silver nanoparticles which have antibacterial properties i washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this and it you know tickled a little bit and it smelled good but i have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness then again nobody has complimented me on the these ones gq did spring for i own these but i will tell you not only did i not get a compliment from any of you i have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that i have owned and i don't think that whether or not you're getting a compliment should be the test of something 's value but i think in the case of a fashion item an article of clothing that's a reasonable benchmark that said a lot of work goes into these they are made from handpicked organic zimbabwean cotton that has been shuttle and then hand dipped in natural indigo twenty four times but no compliments is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oil from an olive that grows on a single slope in tuscany and he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from was kip forbes son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the twentieth century the original owner of the bottle turned out to be one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the eighteenth century oxygen and light he uses tiny bottles the glass is tinted he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas and he actually once he releases a batch of it he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online so you can go online it tasted fine it tasted interesting it was very green it was very peppery but in the blind taste test it came in last which had been oxidizing next to my stove for six months a recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from japan you'll start to notice i don't play golf so i couldn't actually road test these but i did interview a guy who owns them even the people who market these clubs these have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed and thereby drive the ball farther but they'll say look you know you're not getting fifty seven thousand dollars worth of performance from these clubs you're paying for the bling that they're encrusted with gold and platinum the guy who i interviewed who owns them did say that he 's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them so you know this one this is a coffee made from a very unusual process comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations and apparently it's a very picky eater and it you know homes in on only the ripest coffee cherries and then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats leavings then go through the one of the greatest wines in the world the prince of any wine cellar japan is doing crazy things with there is now a toilet that has an mp three player in it there's one with a fragrance dispenser about all the videotape that remains of an event that set off the longest running mystery in the modern wine world and the mystery existed because of a gentleman named hardy rodenstock and transmits the results via email to your doctor it's almost like a home medical center and that is the direction that japanese toilet technology is this one does not have those bells and whistles but for pure functionality it's pretty much the best the neorest six hundred and to try this i couldn't get a loaner but i did go into the manhattan showroom of the manufacturer toto and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use which i it's fully automated you walk towards it and the seat lifts the seat is preheated there's a water jet that cleans you there's an air jet that dries you you get it flushes by itself the lid closes it self cleans not only is it a technological leap forward but i really do believe it's a bit of a cultural leap forward i mean a no hands no toilet paper toilet and i want to get one of these i could not get a loaner of tom cruise supposedly owns this bed there's a little plaque on the end that you know each buyer gets their name engraved on it to try this one the maker of it let me and my wife spend the night in the manhattan showroom lights this was a fun one this is the fastest street legal car in the world and the most expensive production car i got to drive this with a chaperone from the company i get up to eighty they start to rattle i switched lanes on the highway and the driver this chaperone said you know you were just going one hundred and ten miles an hour and i had no idea that i was one of those obnoxious people you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic because it was just that smooth and if i was a this is a completely gratuitous video i'm just going to show of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology this is tom cruise arriving at the mission impossible and cheval blanc is kind of an unusual wine for bordeaux in having a significant percentage of that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following but it's sixty years old there's not much of it left what there is of it left you don't know if it's real it's considered to be the most faked wine in the world not that many people are looking to pop open their one remaining bottle for a journalist so i'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these i'd put out feelers to retailers to auctioneers and it was coming up empty and then i got an email from a guy named is a uc riverside theoretical physicist who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings and he said i 've got a and it was an invitation you do not refuse i went it was three days four meals and at lunch on saturday we opened the forty seven and call my palate a philistine palate so it doesn't necessarily mean something that i wasn't impressed but i was not the only one there who had that reaction and it wasn't just to that wine he wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles he would not revealexactly where the building was and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building any one of the wines served at this tasting if i'd been served it at a dinner party it would have been you know the wine experience of my lifetime and incredibly memorable but drinking sixty great wines over three days they all just blurred together and it became almost a grueling experience and i just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study which came out earlier this year from some researchers at stanford and caltech and they gave subjects the same wine labeled with different price tags a lot of people you know said that they liked the more expensive wine more it was the same wine but they thought it was a different one that was more expensive but what was unexpected was that these researchers did mri brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag thank you the mystery persisted for about twenty years it finally began to get resolved in two thousand and five because of this bill koch is a florida billionaire who owns four of the jefferson bottles and he

the population likes classical music if only we could move it to four percent our problems would be if you thought everybody loves classical music they just haven't found out about it yet see different worlds now i had an amazing experience i was forty five years old i'd been conducting for twenty years i see some of you recognize this child now if he practices for a year and takes lessons he 's now eight and he sounds like this and i suddenly had a realization the conductor of an orchestra doesn't make a sound my picture appears on the front of the cd but the conductor doesn't make a sound he depends for his power on his ability to make other people powerful and that changed everything for me it was totally life changing i wanted to know whether i was doing that and you know how you find out you look at their eyes if their eyes are shining you know you're doing it you could light up a village with this guy 's eyes right so if the eyes are shining you know you're doing it if the eyes are not shining you ask a question and this is the question who am i being that my players eyes are not shining we can do that with our children too who am i being that my children 's eyes that's a totally different world now we're all about to end this magical on the mountain week and we're going back into the world and i say it's appropriate for us to ask the question who are we being as we go back out into the world and you know i have a definition of success for me it's very simple it's not about wealth and fame and power it's about how many shining eyes i have around me so now i have one last thought which is that it really makes a difference what we say the words that come out of our mouth i learned this from a woman who survived auschwitz one of the rare survivors she went to auschwitz when she was fifteen years old and her brother was eight and the parents were lost and she told me this she said we were in the train going to auschwitz and i looked down and saw my brother 's shoes were missing so stupid can't you keep your things together for goodness sake the way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother and i made a vow and the vow was i will never say anything that couldn't stand as the last thing i ever say for another year and takes lessons now he 's nine now can we do that no and we'll make ourselves wrong and others wrong but it is a possibility to live into thank you for another and takes lessons now he 's ten if you'd waited if you'd waited for one more year you would have heard this what happened was not maybe what you thought which is he suddenly became passionate engaged involved got a new teacher he hit puberty or whatever it is what actually happened was the impulses were reduced you see the first time he was playing with an impulse on every note by looking at my head the nine year old the nine year old put an impulse on every and the ten year old on every eight notes and the one impulse on the whole phrase i don't know how we got into this position say i'm going to move my shoulder over move my body no the music pushed me over which is why i call it one you know a gentleman was once watching a presentation i was doing when i was working with a young pianist he was the president of a corporation in ohio and i was working with this young pianist and i said the trouble with you is you're a two buttock player you should be a one buttock player and i moved his body like that while he was playing and suddenly the music took off took flight there was a gasp in the audience when they heard the difference and then i got a letter from this gentleman he said i was so moved i went back and i transformed my entire company into a one and one of them wrote situation hopeless stop they don't wear shoes and the other one wrote glorious opportunity they don't have any shoes yet don't mind now comes the third group these are the people who never listen to classical music it's just simply not part of your life you might hear it like second hand smoke at the airport but people think they're tone deaf actually i hear a lot my husband is tone deaf actually you cannot be tone deaf nobody is tone deaf if you were tone deaf you couldn't change the on your car in a stick shift car you couldn't tell the difference between somebody from texas and somebody from rome and the telephone the telephone if your mother calls on the miserable telephone she calls and says hello you not only know who it is you know what mood she's in you have a fantastic ear everybody has a fantastic ear so nobody is tone deaf but i tell you what it doesn't work for me to go on with this thing with such a wide gulf between those who understand love and passionate about classical music and those who have no relationship the tone deaf people they're no longer here but even between those three categories it's too wide a gulf so i'm not going to go on until every single person in this room downstairs and in aspen and everybody else looking now there's a similar situation in the classical music world because there are some people who think that classical music is dying and there are some of us who think you ain't seen nothing yet will come to love and understand classical music so that's what now you notice that there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that this is going to work if you look at my face it's one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he 's leading to realize whatever he 's dreaming imagine if martin luther king had said i have a dream of course i'm not sure they'll be up to it i think probably happened in this room when i started you thought how beautiful that sounds the same place for our summer holidays next year has it ever occurred to you that the reason you feel sleepy in classical music is not because of you but because of us did anybody think while i was playing why is he using so many impulses if i'd done this with my head you certainly would have thought it and for and rather than go into statistics and trends and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing the rest of your life every time you hear classical music you'll always be able to know if you hear those impulses so let 's see what's really going on here we have a b this is a b the next note is a c and the job of the c is to make the b sad with four sads now we have and the record companies that are folding i thought we should do an experiment tonight an experiment actually it's not really an experiment because i know the outcome that might nobody is tone deaf right nobody is you know every village in bangladesh and every hamlet in china everybody knows da da da da da everybody knows who 's expecting that e now chopin didn't want to reach the e there he backs away and he goes up to him again and almost kills him and the critics all of whom are sitting in the back row there they have to have an opinion so they say hamlet is a procrastinator they say hamlet has an oedipus complex no otherwise the play would be over stupid that's why shakespeare puts all that stuff in hamlet you know ophelia going mad and the play within the play and yorick 's skull and the grave diggers that's in order to delay until act five he can kill him it's the same with the chopin he 's just about to reach the now he gets excited have to worry about it now he gets to f sharp and finally he goes down to now we call that a deceptive cadence because it deceives us i always tell my students if you have a deceptive cadence be sure to raise your eyebrows then everybody will know it's the wrong chord now he tries e again it's the same gesture he makes when he comes home after a long day turns off the key in his car and says aah i'm home because we all know where home is so this is a piece which goes from away to all the way through and you're going to follow b c b c b c b down to a down to g down to f almost goes to e but otherwise the play would be over he goes back up to b he gets very excited to e it's the wrong chord it's the wrong chord it's the wrong chord and finally goes to e and it's home and what you're going to see is one buttock playing for me to join the b to the e i have to stop thinking about every single note along the way and start thinking about the long long line from b to e you know we were just in south africa and you can't go to south africa without thinking of mandela in jail for twenty seven years what was he thinking about lunch to follow the line all the way from b to e and i've one last request before i play this piece all the way through would you think of somebody who you who 's no longer there a beloved grandmother a lover somebody in your life who you love with all your heart but that person is no longer with you bring that person into your mind and at the same time follow the line all the way from b to e and you'll hear everything that now you may be you may be wondering why i'm clapping well i did this at a school in boston with about seventy seventh graders twelve year olds and i did exactly what i did with you and i told them and explained them and the whole thing and at the end they went crazy clapping they were clapping i was clapping they were clapping finally i said why am i clapping and one of the little kids said because we were listening by a piece by chopin now that is something now am i sure that every single person followed that understood it was moved by it of course i can't be sure but i tell you what happened to me i was in ireland and one of them came to me the next morning and he said you know i've never listened to classical music in my life but when you played that shopping piece he said my brother was shot last year and i didn't cry for him but last night when you played that piece he was the one i was thinking about and i felt the tears streaming down my face and you know it felt really good to cry for my brother so i made up my mind at that moment,1
50,BenoitMandelbrot_2010.sph.wav,now this is the real it's a cauliflower now why do i show a cauliflower a very ordinary and ancient vegetable because old and ancient as it may be it's very complicated and it's very simple both at the same time if you try to weigh it of course it's very easy to weigh it and when you eat it the weight matters but suppose you try to measure its surface very interesting if you cut with a sharp knife one of the florets of a cauliflower and look at it separately you think of a whole cauliflower but smaller and then you cut again again again again again again again again again and you still get small cauliflowers so the experience of humanity has always been that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property that each part is like the whole but smaller did humanity do with that very very little so what i did actually is to study this problem and i found something surprising that one can measure roughness by a number a number two point three one point two and sometimes much more one day a friend of mine to bug me brought a picture and said what is the roughness of this curve i said well just short of one point five it was one point time i've been looking at these things for so long so these numbers are the numbers which denote the roughness of these surfaces i hasten to say that these surfaces and so on the left i took the roughness copied from many landscapes to the right i took a higher roughness so the eye after a while can distinguish these two very well well the topic i'm going to discuss is one which is in a certain sense very peculiar because it's very old roughness is part of human life to learn about measuring roughness this is very rough and this is sort of smooth and this perfectly smooth very few things are very smooth so then if you to ask questions what's the surface of a cauliflower well you measure and measure and measure each time you're closer it gets bigger very very small distances what's the length of the coastline of these lakes the closer you measure the longer it the concept of length of coastline which seems to be so natural because it's given in many cases is in fact completely fallacy there's no such thing you must do it differently what good is that to know these things well surprisingly enough it's good in many ways to begin with artificial landscapes which i invented sort of are used in cinema all the time we see mountains in the distance they may be mountains but they may be just just cranked on now it's very easy to do it used to be very time consuming but now it's nothing something very strange if you take this thing you know very well it weighs very little the volume of a lung is very small but what about the area of why so because in fact the area of the lung is something very the bronchi branch branch branch and they stop branching not because of any matter of principle but because of physical considerations the mucus which is in the lung so what happens is that the way you have a much bigger lung but if it branches and branches down to distances about the same for a whale for a man and for what good is it to have that well surprisingly enough amazingly enough the anatomists had a very poor idea of the structure of the lung until very recently and i think that my mathematics so i found myself in other words constructing a geometry a geometry of things which had no geometry and a surprising aspect of it is that very often the rules of this geometry are extremely short it several times sometimes repeatedly again again again the same repetition and at the end you get things like that this cloud is completely one hundred percent artificial something so complicated like a cloud so unstable so varying should have a simple rule behind it now this simple rule not an explanation of clouds the seer of clouds had to take account of it i don't know how much advanced these pictures are they're old i was very much involved in it but then turned my attention to other phenomena now here is another thing which is one of the shattering events in the history of mathematics which is not appreciated by many people different kinds of mess now in fact by a complete fluke i got involved many years ago in a study of this form of complexity to an extent which was absolutely amazing that man can invent things that nature in particular it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane a curve 's a curve a plane 's a plane and the two won 't mix well they do mix a man named peano did define such curves and it became an object of extraordinary interest it was very important but mostly interesting because a kind of break a separation between the mathematics coming from reality on the one hand and new mathematics coming from pure man 's mind well i was very sorry to point out that the pure man 's mind has in fact seen at long last what had been seen for a long time and so here i introduce something the set of rivers of a plane filling curve and well it's a story unto itself and the objects which were used as examples when i was a child and a student of the break between mathematics and visible reality those objects i turned them completely around i used them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature i first told it to my friends in mathematics they said don 't be silly it's just something well actually i was and to my utter amazement i found traces very strong traces i must say of order in that painter hokusai knew it very well the things on the ground are algae he did not know the mathematics it didn't yet exist and he was japanese who had no contact with the west but painting for a long time had a fractal side i could speak of that for a long time has a fractal aspect and i read the book that mister eiffel wrote about his tower and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood this is a mess mess mess brownian loop one day i decided i was held by so many things in my work i decided to test myself could i just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time and find something dramatically new then i was telling my assistant i don't see anything can you paint it so he painted it which means he put inside everything he said well this thing came out and i said stop stop stop i see it's an island and amazing so brownian motion which happens to have a roughness number of two i measured it one point three three again again again long measurements big brownian motions one point three three mathematical problem how to prove it it took my friends twenty years three of them were having incomplete proofs they got together and together they had the proof and so today i would like to present to you a few examples of what this represents i prefer the word roughness to the word irregularity because irregularity to someone who had latin so they got the big medal in mathematics one of the three medals that people have received for proving things which i've seen without being able to prove them now everybody asks me at one point or another how did it all start what got you in that strange business to be at the same time a mechanical engineer a geographer and a mathematician and so on well actually i started oddly enough studying stock market prices and so here i had this theory and i wrote books about it it was very easy and you can write many books very fast about it there are thousands of books on that now compare that with real price increments and where are real price increments well these other lines include some real price increments and some forgery which i did so the idea there was that one must able to how do you say model price variation and it went really well fifty years ago for fifty years people were sort of pooh poohing me because they could do it much much easier but i tell you at this point people listened to me these two curves are averages standard poor the blue one and the red one is standard poor 's from which the five biggest discontinuities are taken out now discontinuities are a nuisance so in many studies of prices one puts them aside well acts of and you have the little nonsense which is left acts of god in this picture five acts of god are as important as everything in other words it is not acts of god that we should put aside that is the meat the problem if you master these you master price and if you don't master these you can master the little noise as well as you can but it's not important well here are the curves for it now i get to the final thing which is the set of which my name is attached in my long past youth means the contrary of regularity but it is not so regularity is the contrary of in a way it's the story of my life my adolescence was spent during the german occupation of france and since i thought that i might vanish within a day or a week i had very big dreams and after the war i saw an uncle again my uncle was a very prominent mathematician and he told me look there's a problem which i could not solve twenty five years ago and i went from what's called real numbers which are points on a line to imaginary complex numbers which are points on a plane which is what one should do there and this shape came out this shape is of an extraordinary complication equation is hidden there z goes into z squared plus c it's so simple so dry it's so uninteresting now you turn the crank once twice twice marvels come out i mean this comes out i don't want to explain these things this comes out this comes out shapes which are of such complication such harmony and such beauty because the basic aspect of the world is very rough so let me show you a few objects some of them are artificial others of them are very real in a certain sense this comes out repeatedly again again again and that was one of my major discoveries was to find that these islands were the same as the whole big thing more or less and then you get these extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place all that from this little formula which has whatever five symbols in it and then this one the color was added for two reasons first of all because these shapes are so complicated one couldn't make any sense of the numbers and if you plot them you must choose some system and so my principle has been to always present the shapes with different colorings because some colorings emphasize that and others it is that or that it's so complicated a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing so where did this come from obviously from so the newspaper in cambridge published an article about that discovery and received the next day five thousand letters from people saying but that's simply a mandelbrot set very well let me finish this shape here just came out of an exercise in pure mathematics bottomless wonders spring from simple rules which are repeated without end thank you very much,1
51,BertrandPiccard_2009G.sph.wav,so you see this is what we're doing on our side everyone has his goal has his dreams has his visions the question i leave you with now is which is the ballast you would like to throw overboard which will be the altitude at which you would like to fly in your life to get to the success that you wish to have to get to the point that really belongs to you with the potential you have and the one you can really fulfill because the most renewable energy we have how do we steer a balloon by understanding that the atmosphere is made out of several different layers of wind which all have different direction so then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory in life or in the balloon we have to change altitude but how do we do that in ballooning or in life how do we change altitude how do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day well in a balloon it's easy we have ballast and when we drop the ballast overboard we climb sand water all the equipment we don't need anymore and i think in life it should be exactly like this you know when people speak about pioneering spirit well very often they believe that pioneers are the ones who have new ideas it's not true the pioneers are not the ones who have new ideas because new ideas are so easy to have we just close our eyes for a minute we all come back with a lot of new ideas learned a lot of things about ballooning especially at the end of these balloon flights around the world i did with brian jones the pioneer is the one who allows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast habits certainties convictions exclamation marks paradigms dogmas and when we are able to do that what happens life is not anymore just one line going in one direction in one dimension no life is going to be made out of all the possible lines that go in all the possible directions in three and pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves to explore this vertical axis of course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon but in life itself this is very practical this can be in politics this can be in spirituality this can be in environment in finance in education of children i deeply believe that life is a much greater adventure if we manage to do politics when i took this picture the window was frozen because of the moisture of the night and on the other side there was a rising sun i deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment if we get rid if we throw overboard this fundamentalism that some of the greens have showed in the past and that we can aim for much higher spirituality if we get rid of the religious dogmas throwing overboard as ballast to change our direction well these basically are things i believed in such a long time but actually i had to go around the world in a balloon to be invited to talk about it one who calculate the direction of each layer of wind at which altitude in order to help the balloonist but sometime it's very paradoxal when brian jones and i were flying around the world the weather man asked us one day to fly quite low and very slow and when we calculated we thought we're never going to make it around the world at that speed so we disobeyed we flew much higher and double the speed and i was so proud to have found that jetstream that i called the weather man and i told him hey guy don't you think we're good pilots up there we fly twice the speed you predicted and he told me don 't do that go down immediately in order to slow down so you see that on the other side of ice you have the unknown you have the non obvious you have the non seen for the people who don't dare to go through the ice and i started to argue i said i 'm not going to do that we don't have enough gas to fly so slow and he told me yes but with the low pressure you have on your left if you fly too fast in a couple of hours you will turn left and end up at the north pole and then he asked me and this is something i will never forget in my life he just asked me you 're the good pilot up there what do you really want you want to go very fast in the wrong direction or slowly in the good direction and this is why you need weathermen this is why you need people with long term vision and this is precisely what fails in the political visions we have now in the political governments we are burning as you heard so much energy not understanding that such an unsustainable way of life can not last for long so we went down actually we slowed down and we went through moments of fears because we had no idea how the little amount of gas we had in the balloon could allow us to travel forty five thousand kilometers in the middle of the pacific when you don't have the good winds you can not land you can not go back that's a crisis that's the moment when you have to wake up from the automatic way of thinking that's the moment when you have to motivate your inner potential your creativity that's when you throw out all the ballast all the certainties in order to adapt to the new situation and actually we changed completely our flight plan we changed completely our strategy and after twenty days we landed successfully in egypt but if i show you this picture it's not to tell you how happy we were it's to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles we took of with three point seven tons of liquid propane we landed with forty kilos when i saw that i made a promise to myself i made a promise that the next time i would fly around the world it would be with no fuel so many people who prefer to suffer in the ice they know instead of taking the risk of going through the ice to see what there is on the other side i had no idea how it was possible i just thought it's a dream and i want to do it and when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the air and space museum in washington together with the airplane of charles lindbergh with apollo eleven with the wright brothers flier with chuck yeager 's sixty one i had really a thought then i thought well the twentieth century that was brilliant it allowed to do all those things there but it will not be possible in the future any more it takes too much energy it will cost too much it will be prohibited because we'll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now so how can we perpetuate this pioneering spirit with something that will be independent from fossil energy and this is when the project solar impulse really started to turn in my head it has been done but rather to improve the quality of life how can we go through the ice of certainty in order to make the most incredible a possible thing what is today completely impossible rid of our dependency on fossil energy if you tell to people we want to be independent from fossil energy in our world people will laugh at you except here where crazy people are invited to speak and i think that's one of the main problems of our society we learn maybe not the famous ted audience but so many other people learn so the idea is that if we fly around the world in a solar powered airplane using absolutely no fuel nobody ever could say in the future that it's impossible to do it for cars for heating systems for computers and so on and so on well solar power airplanes are not new they have flown in the past but without saving capabilities without batteries which means that they have more proven the limits of renewable energies than the potential of if we want to show the potential we have to fly day and night that means to load the batteries during the flight in order to spend the night on the batteries and fly the next day again it has been made already on remote controlled little airplane models without pilots but it stays an anecdote because the public couldn't identify to i think you need a pilot in the plane that can talk to the universities that can talk to students talk to politicians during the flight and really make it a human adventure that unfortunately four meters wingspan is not enough you need sixty four meter wingspan because fuel is not easy to replace that's for sure and with two hundred square meters of solar power on our plane we can produce the same energy than two hundred little lightbulbs that means a christmas tree a big christmas tree the unknown the doubts the question marks are dangerous and we have to resist to the changes we have to keep everything under control so the question is how can you carry a pilot around the world with an airplane that uses the same amount of energy as a big christmas tree people will tell you it's impossible and that's exactly why we try to do it we have gone through the stages of simulation design computing preparing the construction of the first prototype that has been achieved after two years of work propeller engine just the fuselage here it's so light it's not designed by an artist but it could be fifty kilos for the entire fuselage couple of kilos more for the wing spars this is the complete structure of the airplane and one month ago we have unveiled it you can not imagine how it is for a team who has been working six years on it to show that it's not only a dream and a vision it's a real airplane real airplane that we could finally present and what's the goal now the goal is to take end of this year for the first test but mainly next year spring or summer take off on our own power without additional help without being to nine thousand meters altitude the same time we load the batteries we run the engines and when we get at the maximum we arrive at the beginning of the night and there there will be just one goal just one reach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty well the unknown is part of life and in that sense ballooning is a beautiful metaphor because in the balloon like in life and this is exactly the symbol of our world if our airplane is too heavy if the pilot wastes energy never make it through the night and in our world if we keep on spoiling wasting our energy resources if we keep on building things that consume so much energy that most of the companies now go bankrupt it's clear that we'll never give the planet to the next generation without a major problem so you see that this airplane is more a symbol i don't think it will transport two hundred people in the next but when lindbergh crossed the atlantic the payload was also just sufficient for one person and some fuel and twenty years later there were two hundred people in every airplane crossing the atlantic so we have to start and show the example a little bit like on this picture here this is a painting from in the museum in holland that i love so much it's a pipe and it's written this is not a pipe this is not an airplane this is a symbol of what we can achieve when we believe in the impossible when we have a team when we have pioneering spirit and especially when we understand that all the certainties we have should be thrown overboard pleases me very much is that in the beginning i thought that we would have to fly around the world with no fuel in order to have our message been understood and more and more we're invited around the world with andre to talk about that project to talk about the symbol of it invited by politicians invited in we go very well in unforeseen directions we want to go in a direction but the winds push us in another direction like in life energy forums in order to show that it's not anymore completely stupid to think about getting rid of the dependency on fossil energies so through speeches like this one today through interviews through meetings our goal is to get as many people possible on the team success will not come if we just quote unquote fly around the world in a solar powered airplane no the success will come if enough people are motivated to do exactly the same in their daily life save energy go to renewables and this is possible you know with the technologies we have today we can save between thirty and fifty percent of the energy of a country in europe and we can solve half of the rest with renewables it leaves twenty five or thirty percent for oil gas coal nuclear or whatever this is acceptable this is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team you can just go on solarimpulse com subscribe to just be informed of what we're doing but much more to get advices to give your comments to spread the word that if it's possible in the air of course it's possible in the and as long as we fight horizontally against life against the winds against what's happening to us life is a nightmare and each time we have some ice in the future we have to know that life will be great and the success will be brilliant if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice to go through the obstacle to go through the problem in order to see what there is on the other side,1
52,BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W.sph.wav,is probably true that's really what it needs we need it we respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman as a community and as part of this planet getting to know her that individual personality of hers and really coming to know her now i'm destined to spend a lot of time with some unique very very special individualistic and often seductive female characters clearly one of them and this little leopard legadema is another and she changed our lives well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her in fact more time than even her mother did when her mother would go off hunting we would stay and film and early on a lightning bolt hit a tree twenty paces away from us it was frightening and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell and of course we were standing for well we needn't have worried she came charging out of the thicket straight towards us sat next to us shivering with her back towards dereck and looking out and actually from that day on she's been comfortable with us so we felt that that day was the day that she really earned her name we called about the african wilderness and protecting the african wilderness and so what we've done is we've focused on which means light from the sky now we've found these individualisms in all sorts of animals in particular in the cats this particular one is called eetwidomayloh he who greets with fire and you can just see that about him you know that's his character but only by getting up close to these animals and spending time with them can we actually even reach out and dig out these personal characters that but through our investigation we have to seek the wildest places in africa and right now this is in the okavango delta in botswana yes it is swamp we live in the swamp in a tent but i must tell you everyday is exhilarating but also our hearts are in now one of the big things of course everybody knows that cats hate water and so this was a real revelation for us and we could only find this by pushing ourselves by going where no sane person should go and i know in the light of around we don't always get we seriously underestimated the depth we got deeper and deeper until it we drowned our pride i must tell you which was really serious and we seized the and of course one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who drowns the vehicle gets to swim with the crocodiles notice also that all of these images here are taken from the top angle by beverly the dry top angle all the places we get stuck in really have great views and it wasn't a moment and these lions came back towards us and beverly was able to get a great but we truly do spend day and night trying to capture unique footage and twenty years ago we did a film called eternal enemies one would it was amazing because you can see that this lion is doing exactly what his name eetwidomayloh represents he 's focused on this hyena and he is going to get it but that 's i think what this is all about is that these individuals have these personalities and characters but for us to get them not only do we push ourselves but we live by certain rules of engagement which mean we can't interfere today we're here to share with you a message that we have learned from a very important and special character this so as dereck says we have to work through extremes extreme temperatures push ourselves at night sleep deprivation on the edge through a large part of the time for ten years we tried to that it was a disturbing night for me i had tears rolling down my cheeks i was shaking with anxiety but i knew that to capture something that had never been seen before had never been documented and i do believe you should stay with us the amazing thing about these moments and this is probably a highlight of our career is that you never know how it's going to end many people believe in fact that death begins in the eyes not in the heart not in the lungs and that's when people give up hope or when any life form gives up and you can see the start of it here this elephant against overwhelming odds simply gives up well our lives have basically been like a super long episode of csi something like twenty eight years but by the same token so just when you think it's all over something else happens some spark gets into some sort of will to fight that iron will that we all have that this elephant has that conservation has that big cats have everything has that will to survive to fight to push through that mental barrier and to keep going and for us in many ways this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration for us a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our this is about couples working together and so i do need to say that within the vehicle we have quite strict territories beverly and but when this little cub saw that i had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear she came in like a curious cat to come and it was phenomenal and we felt grateful that she trusted us to that extent but at the same time we were concerned that if she created this as a habit and jumped into somebody else's car it might not turn out the same way she might get shot for that so we knew we had to react quickly and the only way we thought we could without scaring her were excited i was like watching a graduation ceremony we felt like we were surrogate parents and of course we knew now that she was going to survive but only when we saw the tiny baby baboon clinging to the mother 's fur did we realize that something very unique was taking place here with the next couple of hours was very unique it was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety protecting it from the hyena over the next five hours she took care of it we realized that we actually don't know everything and that so she was a little bit but in fact what we were seeing here was interesting because she is a wanting to play but she was also a predator needing to kill and yet conflicted in some way because she was also an emerging mother she had this maternal instinct and of course through the night they lay together they ended up sleeping for hours but i have to tell you everybody always asks what happened to the baby baboon die and we suspect it was from the freezing so at this stage i guess we had very very firm ideas on what conservation meant we had to deal with these individual personalities we had to deal with them with respect and celebrate them and so we with the national geographic formed the big cats initiative to march forward into conservation taking care of the big cats that we loved and then had an opportunity to look back over the last fifty years to see how well we had all collectively been doing so when beverly and i were born there were four hundred and fifty thousand lions and today there are twenty and then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to twelve thousand leopards have plummeted from seven hundred thousand down to fifty thousand now in the extraordinary time that we have worked with legadema which is really over a five year period ten thousand leopards were legally shot by safari hunters and that's not the only leopards that were being killed through that period the same tree that we found her mother in and her grandmother and she took us on a journey and revealed something very special to us an immense amount of poaching as well and so possibly the same amount it's simply not sustainable we admire them and we fear them we want to steal their power it used to be the time where only kings wore a leopard skin but now throughout rituals and ceremonies traditional healers and ministers and of course looking at that has been skinned it eerily reminds me of a human hand and that's ironic because their fate is in our hands a burgeoning bone trade south africa just released some lion bones onto the market lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same and so in the lion bone industry is going to wipe out all the tigers so we have a real problem here no more so than the lions the male lions so the twenty thousand lion figure you just saw is actually a red herring because there may be three or four thousand male lions and they all are actually infected with the same disease because there's a sport there's an activity going on that we're all aware of that we and you have to know that when a male lion is into the area and takes over the pride and of course first of all kills all the cubs and possibly some of the females that eight days old and the minute we found this leopard we realized that we needed to move in and so we basically stayed with this leopard for the next four so we've estimated that between twenty to thirty lions are killed when one lion is hanging on a wall somewhere in a far off place so what our investigations have shown is that these lions are essential they're essential to the habitat it they disappear whole ecosystems in africa disappear an eighty billion dollar a year eco tourism revenue stream into africa so this is not just a concern about lions it's a concern about communities in africa as well if they disappear all of that goes away but what i'm more concerned about in many ways is that as we de link ourselves from nature as we de link ourselves spiritually from these animals we so you have to know looking into the eyes of and leopards right now it is all about critical awareness and so what we are doing in february we're bringing out a film called the last and the last lion is exactly what is happening right now that is the situation we're in the last that is if we don't take action and do something these plains will be completely devoid of big cats and then in turn everything else will disappear and simply if we can't protect them we're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well and in fact that original thing that we spoke about and designed our lives by that conservation was all about respect and celebration,1
53,BillClinton_2007.sph.wav,of of the the less than three tenths of one percent about forty percent of all the a the fact that that for those of on for in to save as many lives as quickly as we can but to do it in in to a on them to help this it and a of a couple of in the united were more important than public the of try to to to that would to with me and i want to it five hundred dollars first week we were working we got the price down to five hundred dollars of the and a low margin the i we can't do this or the other thing in poor countries in to to a in in of in haiti and that we're and the and put the full resources of the government the in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of is,1
54,BillDavenhall_2009P.sph.wav,but this part of the equation i didn't really get and i don't think my physicians really get this part of the equation what does that mean my environment well it can mean a lot of things this is my life these are my life places we all have these while i'm talking i'd like you to also be thinking about how many places have you lived just think about that you know wander through your life thinking about this and you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places you spend it at rest and you spend it at work and if you're like me you're in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place so it's not really simple when somebody asks you where do you live where do you work and where do you spend all your time and where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don't even see well when i have done this on myself i always come to the conclusion that i spend about seventy five percent of my time and i don't wander far from that place for a majority of my time even though i'm an extensive global trekker can geographic information but this is where i spent my first nineteen years with my little young lungs you know breathing high concentrations here of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and methane gas in unequal quantities nineteen years of this and if you've been in that part of the country this is what those piles of burning smoldering coal waste look like make you healthy so then i decided to leave that part of the world and i was going to go to the mid west okay so i ended up in louisville kentucky well i decided to be neighbors to a place called they manufacture plastics they use large quantities chloroprene and benzene okay i spent twenty five years in my middle age lungs now in two thousand and one i got hit by a train it it was insidious and it was really happening and then i decided i had to get really smart i would take this job in the west coast and i moved to redlands california very nice and there my older senior lungs as i like to call them i filled with particulate matter carbon dioxide and very high does of ozone well the picture is there is a huge gap here the one thing that never happens in my doctor 's office they never ask me about my place history my train was a heart attack doctor can i remember ever asking me asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that i put in my mouth or the food that i ingest into my stomach they really don't do that it's missing look at the kind of data that is available i found myself in a hospital in an intensive care ward so how many people are in the white how many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space anybody boy you're lucky how many have spent it in the red places not so lucky some sense of what's going to be our train wreck but none of that is in my medical record and it's not in yours either recuperating from emergency surgery and i suddenly realized something that i was completely in the dark so here is my friend paul he 's a colleague he allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours twenty four seven three hundred and sixty five days out of the year for the last two years everywhere he and you can see he 's been to a few places around the united states and this is where he has spent most of his time if you really studied that you might have some clues as to what paul likes to do anybody got any clues skiing right we can zoom in here and we suddenly see now we see where paul has really spent a majority of his time and all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the did you know that data existed for every community in the united states you could have your own personalized map of that our cellphones can now build a place history this is how paul did it he did it with his iphone this might be what we end up with this is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room i started asking my questions well why me why now why here could my doctor have warned me so what i want to do here in the few minutes i have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health i suggest that maybe you not decide just because you're out here in beautiful california and it's warm every day that you get out and run at six o'clock at night i'd suggest that that's a bad idea bill because of this report what i'd like to leave you for are two prescriptions okay number one is we must teach physicians about the value of geographical information it's called geomedicine there are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this and they're in the early stages of development these programs need to be supported and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information i've shared here with you today the second thing we need to do is while we're spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record will also be useful for us with that i would like to just say that jack lord said this almost ten years ago just look at that for a minute that was what the conclusion of the dartmouth atlas of healthcare was about with saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease in illness in wellness and how our healthcare system actually operates that was what he was talking about on that quote and i would say he got it right almost a decade ago so i'd very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records so with that i'll leave you that in my particular view of view of health geography always matters and i believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy thank you well i understand the genetics and lifestyle part and you know why i understand that because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this you ever had to fill out those long legal size forms in your doctor 's office i mean if you're lucky enough you get to do it more than once right do it over and over again and they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history your medication history your surgical history your allergy history did i forget any history,1
55,BillGates_2009.sph.wav,first of all there's a lot more testing going on and that's given us the picture of where we are and that allows us to understand that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis is very practical in all public schools and so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say ok here 's a little clip of something i thought i did well little clip of something i think i did poorly advise me when this kid acted up how should i have dealt with that and they could all sit and work together on those problems you can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff you can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course learn from that if you have a kid who 's behind you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept and in fact these free courses could not only be available just on the internet but you could make it so that dvds were always so that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate it's a phenomenal thing each one of those lives matters a lot available and so anybody who has access to a dvd player can have the very best teachers and so by thinking of this as a personnel system we can do it much better and i thought it was so fantastic it gave you a sense of what a good teacher does i'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book i really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have in fact we have in the stimulus bill it's interesting the house version actually had money in it for these data systems and it was taken out in the senate because there are people who are threatened by these things but i i'm optimistic i think people are beginning to recognize how important this is and it really can make a difference for millions of lives if we get it right only had time to frame those two problems there's a lot more problems like that see you're getting excited just at the very name of these things and the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad you know the system doesn't naturally make it happen governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way the private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things so it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things get other people involved and the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs vaccines that were used more widely and you're helping to come up with solutions and with that i think there's some great things that will come out of it well under twenty years why well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths diarrhea pneumonia last week talking about the work of the foundation sharing some of the problems and warren buffet had recommended i do that being honest about what was going well what wasn 't and making it kind of an annual thing actually peaked at a bit over five million in the nineteen thirties so it was absolutely gigantic and the disease was all over the world a terrible disease it was in the united states it was in europe people didn't know what caused it until the early nineteen hundreds when a british military man figured out that it was mosquitoes so it was everywhere two tools helped bring the death rate down one was killing the mosquitoes with ddt the other was treating the patients with quinine or quinine derivatives and so that's why the death rate did come down and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries it doesn't get much investment for example there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria now baldness it's a terrible and rich men are afflicted and so that's why that priority has been set but malaria even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact over two hundred million people at any one time are suffering from it it means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much a goal i had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems because i think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally that is the market does not drive now malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitoes i brought some here just so you could experience this we'll let those roam around the the those mosquitoes are not infected so we've come up with a few new things we've got bed nets and bed nets are a great tool what it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night so the mosquitoes that bite late at night can't get at them and when you use indoor spraying with ddt and those nets you can cut deaths by over fifty percent and that's happened now in a number of countries it's great to see but we have to be careful because malaria and so you end up with two choices if you go into a country with the right tools and the right way you do it vigorously you can actually get a local eradication and that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking or if you go in kind of half heartedly for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden but eventually those tools will become ineffective and the death rate will soar back up again and the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention now we're on the upswing bed net funding is up there's new drug discovery going on our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months over two thirds of the lives if it's effective so we're going to have these new tools but that alone doesn't give us the road map the scientists the communicators the thinkers the governments to do the right things and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care it involves social scientists so we know how to get not just seventy percent of the people to use the bed nets but ninety percent we need mathematicians to come in and simulate this to do monte carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise we need rich world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things and so as these elements come together i'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria let me turn to a second question a fairly different question but i'd say equally important and this is how do you make a teacher great let 's start with why this is important well all of us here i'll bet had some great teachers we all had a wonderful education that's part of the reason we're here today part of the reason we're successful i can say that even though i'm a college drop out i had great teachers in fact in the united states the teaching system has worked fairly well there are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places so the top twenty percent of students have gotten a good education and those top twenty percent have been the best in the world if you measure them against the other top twenty percent and they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the u s at the forefront now the strength for those top twenty percent is starting to fade on a relative basis but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to so this morning i'm going to share two of these problems and talk about not only has that been weak it's getting weaker and if you look at the economy it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education and we have to change this we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity we have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education like science and mathematics when i first learned the statistics i was pretty stunned at how bad things are over thirty percent of kids never finish high school and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and the stated dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over thirty percent for minority kids it's over fifty percent and even if you graduate from high school if you're low income you have less than a twenty five percent chance of ever completing a college degree if you're low income in the united states you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four year degree and that doesn't seem entirely fair so how do you make education better our foundation for the last nine years has invested in this there's many people working on it we've worked on small schools we've funded scholarships we've done things in libraries a lot of these things had a good effect but before i dive into those i want to admit that i am an optimist any tough problem i think it can be solved but the more we looked at it the more we realized having great teachers was the very key thing and we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers between say the top quartile the very best and the bottom how much variation is there within a school or between schools and the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable a top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class based on test scores by over ten percent in a single year what does that mean that means that if the entire u s for two years had top quartile teachers the entire difference between us and asia would go away within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away so it's simple all you need are those top quartile teachers and so you'd say wow we should reward those people we should retain those people we should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people but i can tell you that absolutely is not happening today part of the reason i feel that way is looking at the past you might think these are people with master 's degrees they've gone back and they've gotten their master 's of education this chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality that bottom thing which says there's no effect at all is a master 's degree over the past century average lifespan has more than doubled now the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded one is seniority because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension the second is but it in no way is associated with being a better teacher teach for america slight effect for math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect but overwhelmingly it's your past performance there are some people who are very good at this and we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it to raise the average capability or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system another statistic perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths now there are a few places very few where great teachers are being made a good example of one is a set of charter schools called kipp kipp means knowledge is power it's an unbelievable thing they have sixty six schools mostly middle schools some high schools and what goes on is great teaching they take the poorest kids and over ninety six percent of their high school graduates go to four year colleges and the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different in the normal public schools they're team teaching they're constantly improving their teachers they're taking data the test scores and saying to a teacher hey you caused this amount of increase they're deeply engaged in making teaching better actually go and sit in one of these classrooms at first it's very bizarre i sat down and i thought what is going on the teacher was running around and the energy level was high i thought i 'm in the sports rally or something what's going on and the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention which kids were bored and calling kids rapidly putting things up on the board it was a very dynamic environment because particularly in those middle school years fifth through eighth grade keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who a normal school teachers how good they are the data isn't gathered in the teacher 's contract it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom sometimes to once per year and they need advanced notice to do that so imagine running a factory where you've got these workers some of them just making crap and the management is told hey you can only come down here once a year but you need to let us know because we might actually fool you and try and do a good job in that one brief moment even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it they don't have the test scores and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data for example new york passed a law five years ago one hundred and thirty five million children were born so more and less than ten million of them died before the age of five that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachers but i'm optimistic about this i think there are some clear things we can do,1
56,BillGross_2003.sph.wav,really good combination of those two factors it turns out there's a lot of powerful sun all around the world obviously but in special places where it happens to be relatively inexpensive to place these and also in many more places where there is high wind power so an example of that is here 's the map of the united states and all this does is affect the payback period it doesn't mean that you couldn't use solar energy you could use solar energy anywhere on earth it just affects the payback period if you're comparing to grid supplied electricity three lotus one two three came out and i was completely blown away by lotus one two three i began operating my business with one two three began writing add ins for one two three chances for solar energy and of course look at africa it's just unbelievable what the potential is to take advantage of solar energy there and i'm really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that so in conclusion i would say my journey has shown me that you can revisit old ideas in a new light and sometimes ideas that have been discarded in the past can be practical now if you apply some new technology or new twists if you get it down below five years then it becomes almost a no brainer because the interest to own it someone else will finance it for you and you can just make money basically from day one so that's our real powerful goal that we're really shooting for in the company other things that i learned that were very surprising to me one was how casual we are about energy at full power so there's basically fifteen horses running at full speed just to keep the stage lit not to mention the two hundred horses that are probably running right now to keep the airconditioning going just amazing walk in the elevator and there's lights on in the elevator of course now i'm very sensitive at home when we leave the lights on by mistake basically oil is solar energy concentrate it's been pounded for a billion years with a lot of energy to make it have all that energy contained in it and we don't have a birthright to just use that up as fast as we are i think then much much later in two thousand very recently the new california energy crisis or what was purported to be a big energy crisis was coming and i was trying to figure if there was some way we could build something that would capitalize on that and try and get people back up energy in case the crisis really came i started looking at how we could build battery back up systems that could give people five hours ten hours maybe even a full day or three days worth of back up power i'm glad you heard earlier today batteries are unbelievably energy lack of density compared to fuel so much more energy can be stored with fuel than with batteries you'd have to fill your entire parking space of one garage space just to give yourself four hours of battery back up and i concluded after researching every other technology that we could deploy for storing energy flywheels different formulations of batteries it just wasn't practical to store energy so what about making energy maybe we could make energy i tried to figure out maybe solar 's become attractive it's been twenty five years since i was doing this let me go back and look at what's been happening with solar cells and the price had gone down from ten dollars a watt to about four or five dollars a watt but it stabilized and it really needed to get much lower than that to be cost effective i studied all the new things that had happened in solar cells and was trying to look for ways we could innovate and make solar cells more inexpensively a lot of new things that are happening to do that but fundamentally the process requires a tremendous amount of energy some people even say it takes more energy to make a solar cell than it will give out in its entire life hopefully if we can reduce the amount of energy it takes to make the cells that will become more practical but right now you pretty much have to take so i thought of an idea what if we collect the sun with a large reflector like i had been thinking about way back when when i was in high school but maybe with modern technology we could make a cheaper large collector concentrate it to a small converter and then the conversion device wouldn't have to be as expensive because it's much smaller rather than solar cells which have to covering the entire surface area that you want to gather sun from very short on genetic algorithms it's a powerful way of solving intractable problems using natural selection you take a problem that you can't solve with a pure mathematical answer you build an evolutionary system to try multiple tries at guessing the energy crisis was in full bore i started reading popular science magazine and i got really excited about the potential of solar energy to try and solve that crisis you add sex where you take half of one solution and half of another and then make new mutations and you use natural selection to kill off not as good solutions usually with a genetic algorithm on a computer today with a three gigahertz processor you can solve many many formerly intractable problems in just a matter of minutes we tried to come up with a way to use genetic algorithms to create a new type of concentrator and i'll show you what we came up with traditionally concentrators look like this those shapes are they take all the parallel incoming rays and focus it to a single spot they have to track the sun because they have to be pointing directly at the sun they usually have about a one degree acceptance angle meaning once they're more than about a degree off with no moving parts so we created this genetic algorithm to try this out we made a model in xl of a multi surface reflector and an amazing thing evolved literally evolved from trying a billion cycles a billion different attempts with a fitness function that defined how can you collect the most light from the most angles over a day from the sun and this is the shape that evolved two places and take two bounces so for direct light it takes only one bounce for off axis light it might take two and for extreme off axis it might take three i had just taken trigonometry in high school i learned about the parabola and how it could concentrate rays of light to a single focus that got me very excited your efficiency goes down with more bounces because you lose about ten percent with each bounce but this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus twenty five degree angle so about two and a half hours of the day we could collect with a stationary component solar cells collect light for four and a half hours though on an average adjusted day a solar cell because the sun 's moving across the sky the solar cell is going down with a sine wave function of performance at the axis angles it collects about four an a half average hours of sunlight a day so even this although it was great with no moving parts we could achieve high temperatures enough we needed to beat solar cells so we took a look at another idea we looked at a way to break up a parabola into individual petals that would track so what you see here is twelve separate petals that each could be controlled with individual microprocessors that would only cost a dollar you can buy a two megahertz microprocessor for a dollar now and you can buy stepper motors that pretty much never wear out because they have no brushes for a dollar we can control all twelve of these petals for under fifty dollars and what this would allows us to do is not have to move the focus any more only move the petals the whole system would have a much lower profile but also we could gather sunlight for six and a half to seven hours a day now that we have concentrated sunlight what are we going to put at the center to and i really felt that there would be potential to build some kind of thing that could concentrate light so i started this company called solar devices and this was a company where i built so we tried to look at all the different heat engines that have been used in history to try and convert sunlight to electricity or heat to electricity and one of the great ones of all time he added a condenser to cool the steam outside the cylinder he made the engine double acting so it had double the power those were major breakthroughs i mean all of the improvements he made and it's justifiable that our measure of energy the watt today is named after him so we looked at this engine and this had some potential steam engines are dangerous and they had tremendous impact on the world as you know industrial revolution and ships and locomotives but they're usually good to be large so they're not good for this engine because it was so interesting it only worked on air no steam has led to hundreds of creative designs over the years that use the stirling engine principle and it was a major achievement because it brought the power density of the engine way up you could now get a lot more power in a lot smaller space and that allowed the engine to be used for mobile applications so once you have mobility so because it went into mass production costs were reduced one hundred years of refinement emissions were reduced looking at these three and forty seven others we concluded that the stirling engine would be the best one to use i want to give you a brief explanation of how we looked at it and how it works so we tried to look at the stirling engine in a new way because it was practical weight no longer mattered for our application the internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered because you were moving around but if you're trying to generate solar energy in a static place the weight doesn't matter so much the other thing we discovered is that efficiency doesn't matter so much if your energy source is free normally efficiency is crucial because the fuel cost of your engine over its life dwarfs the cost of the engine but if your fuel source is free then the only thing that matters is the up front capital cost of the engine so you don't want to optimize for efficiency you want to optimize for power per dollar so using that new twist with the new criteria we thought we could re look at the stirling engine and also bring genetic algorithms in basically robert stirling didn't have gordon moore before him to get us three gigahertz of processor power so we took the same genetic algorithm that we used earlier to make that concentrator which didn't work out for us to optimize the stirling engine and make its design sizes and all of its dimensions the exact optimum to get the most power per dollar irrespective of weight irrespective of size to get the most conversion of solar energy because the sun is free and that's the process we took let me show you how the engine works the simplest heat engine or hot air engine of all time would be this take a box a steel canister with a piston put a flame under it the piston moves up the problem is the efficiency is one hundredth of one percent because you're heating all the metal of the chamber and then cooling all the metal of the chamber each time you move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you're only shifting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end down to the hot end and up to the cold end so now you're i sold the plans for this engine and for this dish in the back of popular science magazine for four dollars each i'm still heating the air every time and cooling the air every time what about if i put a thermal sponge in the middle in the passageway between where the air has to move between hot and cold so he made fine wires and cracked glass and all different kinds of materials to be a heat sponge so when the air pushes up to go from the hot end to the cold end it puts some heat into the sponge and then when the air comes back after it's been cooled it picks up that heat again so you're reusing your energy five or six times and that brings the efficiency up between thirty and forty percent it's a little known but brilliant genius invention of robert stirling that takes the hot air engine from being somewhat impractical like i found out when i made the real simple version in high school to very potentially possible once you get the efficiency up if you can design this to be low enough cost so we really set out on a path to try and make the lowest cost possible we built a huge mathematical model of how a stirling engine works we applied the genetic and i earned enough money to pay for my first year of caltech it was a really big excitement for me to get into caltech and my first year at caltech i continued the business we got the results from that for the optimal engine we built engines so we built one hundred different engines over the last two years we measured each one we readjusted the model to what we measured and then we led that to the current prototype it led to a very compact inexpensive engine and this is what the engine looks like let me show you what it looks like in real life so this is the engine it's just a small cylinder down here which holds the generator inside and all the linkage and it's the hot cap the hot cylinder on the top this part gets hot this part is cool and electricity comes out the exact converse is also true if you put electricity in this will get hot and this will get cold you get refrigeration so it's a complete reversible cycle a very efficient cycle and quite a simple thing to make so now you put the two things together so you have the engine now what if you combine the petals and the engine in the center the petals track thank you so this is a unit with the twelve petals these petals cost about a dollar each lightweight injection bolted plastic aluminized the mechanism to control each petal is below there with a microprocessor on each one but then in the second year of caltech they started grading the whole first year was pass fail but the second year was graded i wasn't able to keep up with the business there are thermocouples on the engine little sensors that detect the heat when the sunlight strikes them each petal adjusts itself separately to keep the highest temperature on each one of these petals figures out where the sun is with no user set up so you don't have to tell what latitude longitude you're at you don't have to tell what your roof slope angle is doesn't really care what it does is it searches to find the hottest spot it searches again a half an hour later it searches again a day later it searches again a month later it basically figures out where on earth you are by watching the direction the sun moves so you don't have to actually enter anything about that the way the unit works is when the sun comes out the engine will start and you get power out here and i ended up with a twenty five year detour my dream had been to convert solar energy at a very practical cost but then i had this big detour first the hot water 's optional you don't have to use the hot water it will cool itself but you can use it to optionally heat hot water and that brings the efficiency up even higher so this is the first test where we took it outside and each of the petals were individually seeking and what they do is step it could be on your roof or in your backyard or somewhere else you don't have to have enough units to power your entire house you just save money with each incremental one you add so you're still using the grid potentially in this type of application to be your back up supply of course you can't use these at night and you can't use these on cloudy days but by reducing your energy use pretty much at the peak times usually when you have you air conditioning on or other times like that,1
57,BillJoy_2006.sph.wav,so that people who are doing things that had a higher cost of catastrophe would have to take insurance against that risk so if you wanted to put a drug on the market you could put it on but it wouldn't have to be approved by regulators you'd have to convince an actuary with the law and finally i think we have to do something that's not really it's almost unacceptable to say this which we have to begin to design the future we can't pick the future but we can steer the future our investment in trying to prevent pandemic flu is affecting the distribution of possible outcomes we may not be able to stop it but the likelihood that it will get past us is lower if we focus on that problem so we can design the future if we choose what kind of things we want to have happen and not have happen and steer us to a lower risk place vice president gore will talk about how we could steer the climate trajectory into a lower probability of catastrophic risk but above all what we have to do is we have to help the good guys the people on the defensive side have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things and what we have to do to do that is we have to limit access to certain information and growing up as we have and holding very high the value of free speech this is a hard thing for us to accept for all of us to accept it's especially hard for the scientists to accept who still remember you know galileo essentially locked up and who are still fighting this battle against the church but that's the price of having a civilization the price of retaining the rule of law is to limit the access to the great and kind of unbridled power thank you it extends beyond a nation state it's not the nation states that have potential access to mass destruction but individuals and this is a consequence of the fact that these new technologies tend to be digital we saw genome sequences you can download the gene sequences of pathogens off the internet flu is too dangerous to fedex around if people want to use it in their labs for working on research just reconstruct it yourself what technology can we really apply because you know it might break in fedex so that this is possible to do this is not it be biological or other are clearly a danger in our world and the danger is that they can cause roughly what's a pandemic and we really don't have experience with pandemics and we're also not very good as a society at acting to things we don't have direct and sort of gut level experience with so it's not in our nature to pre act to reducing global poverty and in this case piling on more technology doesn't solve the problem because it only super empowers people more so the solution has to be as people like russell and einstein and others imagine in a conversation that existed in a much stronger form i think early in the twentieth century solution had to be not just the head but the heart you know public policy and moral progress the bargain that gives us civilization is a bargain to not use power and what i found was quite surprising we started looking at things like death rates in the twentieth century and how they'd been improved and very simple things turned out we get our individual rights by society protecting us from others not doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is legal and so to limit the danger of these new things we have to limit ultimately the ability of individuals to have access essentially to pandemic power we also have to have sensible defense because no limitation is going to prevent a crazy person from doing something the troubling thing is that it's much easier to do something bad than to defend against all possible bad things so the offensive uses and then i signed a book contract to write more gloomy thoughts about this and moved into a hotel room in new york with one room full of books on the plague and you know nuclear bombs exploding in new york where i would be within the circle and so on and then i was there on september and i stood in the streets with everyone and it was quite an experience to be there i got up the next morning and walked out of the city and all was quite a compelling experience but not really i suppose a surprise to someone who 'd had his room full of the books it was always a surprise that it happened then and there but it wasn't a surprise that it happened at all and everyone then started writing about this thousands of people started writing about this and i eventually abandoned the book and then chris called me to talk at the conference i really don't talk about this any more because you know there's enough frustrating and depressing things going on but i agreed to come and say a few things about this and i would say that we can't give up the rule of law to fight an asymmetric threat which is what we seem to be doing because of the present the people that are in power because that's to give up the thing that makes civilization and we fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we're doing because a million dollar act causes a billion dollars of damage causes a trillion dollar response which is largely ineffective and arguably so after giving up on the book and i had the great honor to be able to join kleiner perkins about a year ago and to work through venture capital on the innovative side and to try to find some innovations that could address what i saw as some of these big problems things where you know a factor of ten difference can make a factor of a thousand difference in the outcome the last year at the incredible quality and excitement of the innovations that have come across my desk it's overwhelming at times i'm very thankful for google and wikipedia so i can understand at least a little of what people are talking about who come through the doors but i wanted to share with you three areas that i'm particularly excited about and that relate to the problems that i was talking about in the wired article then early web the first is this whole area of education and it really relates to what nicholas was talking about with a hundred dollar computer and that is to say that would clearly make a huge difference to we've seen and i've had the pleasure to invest in companies that give me great confidence that we'll extend moore 's law all the way down to roughly the ten scale another factor of say six in dimensional reduction which should give us about another factor of one hundred in raw improvement in what the chips can do and so to put that in practical terms if something costs about one thousand dollars today that problem say the best personal computer you can buy that might be its cost i think we can have that in two thousand and twenty for ten dollars now just imagine what that hundred dollar computer will be in two thousand and twenty as a tool for education i think the challenge for us is i'm very certain that that will happen the challenge is will we develop but i also in looking at more powerful technologies and nanotechnology and genetic engineering the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device i'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers but we don't have very good software for them when they took the apple mac interface and they put it back on the apple ii the apple ii was perfectly capable of running that kind of interface we just didn't know how to do it at the time so given that we know and should believe because moore 's law a constant i mean it's just been very predictable progress over the last forty years or whatever we can know what the computers are going to be like in two thousand and twenty it's great that we have initiatives to say let 's go create the education and educate people in the world because that's a great force for peace and we can give everyone in the world a hundred dollar computer or a ten dollar computer in the next other new emerging kind of digital technologies became very concerned about the potential for abuse the thing that we see as the kind of moore 's law trend that's driving improvement in our ability to address the environmental problem is new materials we have a challenge because the urban population is growing in this century from two billion to six billion in a very short amount of time people are moving to the cities they all need clean water they need energy they need transportation and we want them to develop in a their strength they're almost the strongest material tensile strength material known if you make a three dimensional structure like a buckyball they have all sorts of incredible properties if you shoot a particle at them and knock a hole in them they repair themselves they go zip and they repair the hole in femtoseconds which is not is really quick if you think about it in history a long long time ago we dealt with the problem of if you shine a light on them they produce electricity in fact if you flash them with a camera they catch on fire if you put electricity on them they emit light if you run current through them you can run one thousand times more current through one of these than through a piece of metal you can make both p and n type semiconductors which means you can make transistors out of them they conduct heat along their length but not across well there is no width but not in the other direction if you stack them up that's a property of carbon fiber also if you put particles in them and they go shooting out the tip they're like miniature linear accelerators or electron guns the inside where the kind of things lisa randall 's talking about are in there i had one business plan where i was trying to learn more about witten 's cosmic dimension strings to try to understand what the phenomenon was going on in this proposed nanomaterial so that we can do things with different properties lighter stronger and apply these new materials to the environmental problems new materials that can make water new materials that can make fuel cells work better new materials that catalyze chemical reactions that cut pollution and so on ethanol new ways of making ethanol new ways of making electric transportation the whole green dream because it can be profitable we've dedicated we've just raised a new fund we dedicated one hundred million dollars to these kinds of investments we believe that genentech the compaq the lotus the sun the netscape the amazon the google in these fields are yet to be found because this materials revolution will drive these things forward the third area that we're working on and we just announced last week we were all in new york we raised two hundred million dollars in a specialty fund to work on a pandemic in biodefense and to give you an idea of the last fund that kleiner raised was a four hundred million dollar fund so this for us is a very substantial fund john doerr and brook and others got concerned and we started looking around at what the world was doing about being prepared for a pandemic and we saw to keep the many from tyrannizing the one we came up with concepts like individual liberty a lot of gaps and so we asked ourselves you know can we find innovative things that will go fill these gaps and a break here he said he 's found so much stuff he can't sleep because there's so many great technologies out there we're essentially buried and we need them you know we have one antiviral that people are talking about stockpiling that still works roughly that's tamiflu but tamiflu the virus is resistant it is resistant to tamiflu we've discovered with aids we need cocktails to work well so that the viral resistance we need several antivirals we need better surveillance we need networks that can find out what's going on we need rapid diagnostics so that we can tell if somebody has a strain of flu which we have only identified very recently we've got to be able to make the rapid diagnostics quickly we need new antivirals and cocktails we need new kinds of vaccines vaccines that are broad spectrum vaccines that we can manufacture quickly we believe that if we could fill these ten gaps we have a chance to help really reduce the risk of a pandemic and the difference between a normal flu season and a pandemic is about a factor of one thousand in deaths and certainly enormous economic impact that will address this so if we can address use technology help address education help address the environment help address the pandemic does that solve the larger problem so what we need to do is we need better policy and for example some things we could do that would be policy solutions which are not really in the political air right now but perhaps with the change of administration would be use markets markets are a very strong force for example rather than try to regulate away problems which probably won 't work if we could price into the cost of doing business the cost of catastrophe,1
58,BillStone_2007.sph.wav,it can be done in seven years with the right backing those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history and join other bold individuals from time past who had they been here today would have heartily approved we have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance from the entrance this is nothing like a commercial cave there was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier we have collectively forgotten that lesson now we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward one hundred years after sir ernest shackleton wrote these words i intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon and complete the final piece that will open the space frontier in our time for all of us thank you you're looking at camp two in a place called j two not k two but j two we're roughly two days from the entrance at that point and first place i'd like to take you is what many believe will be damp moist cold conditions in utterly dark places i should mention that everything you're seeing here by the way is artificially illuminated at great effort otherwise it is completely dark in these places deeper you go the more you run into a conflict with water it's basically like a tree collecting water coming down and eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous and unfortunately slides just don't do justice so i've got a very brief clip here taken in the late nineteen eighties descend into huautla plateau in mexico the world 's deepest natural abyss and i say believe because this process is still ongoing right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year that i'll talk a little bit about i have to tell you that the techniques being shown here are obsolete and dangerous we would not do this today unless we were doing it for film along that same line to tell you that with the spate of hollywood movies came out last year we have never seen monsters underground at least the kind that eat you if there is a monster underground it is the crushing psychological remoteness that begins to hit every member of the team once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance next year i'll be leading an international team to j two we're going to be shooting from minus two thousand six hundred meters that's a little over eight thousand six hundred feet down at thirty kilometers from the entrance the lead crews will be underground for pushing thirty days straight i don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time when you used to find these things they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon now i remember that term really well for two reasons number one it's the name of my rock band and second is because the confrontation of these things forced me to become an inventor and we've since gone on to develop many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this this is some life support equipment closed cycle and you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally underwater and to depths of two hundred meters straight down underwater when you do this kind of stuff it's like doing eva it's like doing extra vehicular activity in space at much greater distances and at much greater physical peril so it makes you think about how to design your equipment for long range away from a safe haven here 's a things that's changed here in the last one hundred and fifty years since jules verne had great science fiction concepts of what the underworld was like is that this is where the it was developed within a two year period and used on actual exploratory projects this gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper and it produced the first three dimensional map anybody has ever done of a cave and it happened to be underwater in wakulla springs it was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door to another unexplored world this is europa carolyn porco mentioned another one called enceladus the other day this is one of the places where couple of years ago called aliens of the deep there was a brief clip a mission to explore under the ice of europa would be the ultimate to it's basically a nuclear heated torpedo when you reach the surface needs to be one smart puppy able to navigate and make decisions jim didn't know when he released that movie was that six months earlier nasa had funded a team i assembled three years of engineering meetings design and system integration and introduced depthx deep phreatic thermal explorer and as the movie says this is one smart puppy more than ten kilos of tnt in electrical onboard equivalent this is the target site the world 's deepest hydrothermal spring at cenote zacaton in northern mexico it's been explored to a depth of two hundred and ninety two meters and beyond that nobody knows anything this is part of depthx 's mission there's two primary targets we're doing here one is how do you do science autonomy underground how do you take a robot and turn it into a field wall where there's a high probability of life we move along the wall in what's called proximity operations looking for changes in color if we see something that looks interesting we pull it into a microscope if it passes the microscopic test and chambers so large that you can see for hundreds of meters without a break in the line of sight we go for a collection we either draw in a liquid sample or we can actually take a solid core from the wall no hands at the wheel this is all behavioral autonomy here that's being conducted by the robot on its own the real hat trick for this vehicle though is a disruptive new navigation system we've developed known as three d slam for simultaneous localization and mapping an all seeing eyeball its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time allowing it to do new exploration while it's still achieving geometric sensor lock on what it's gone through already what i'm going to show you next is the first fully autonomous when you go on a thing like this we can usually be in the field for anywhere from two to four months with a team of as small as twenty or thirty to as big as one hundred and fifty this may we're going to go from minus one thousand meters in zacaton and if we're very lucky depthx will bring back the first robotically discovered division of bacteria the successful conclusion of that mission will result in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number of government scientists and pilots it will leave us no further along in the general expansion of humanity into space than we were fifty years ago to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas and i hope you'll bear with me and have some faith that there's credibility behind what we're going to say here there are three underpinnings is the requirement for economical earth to space transport the bert rutans and richard bransons of this world have got this in their sights and i salute them go go go the next thing we need people ask me you know what kind of people do you get for a project like this and while our are places to stay on orbit orbital hotels to start with but workshops for the rest of us later on the final missing piece the real paradigm buster is this a gas station on orbit it's not going to look like that if it existed it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning now ten thousand dollars for that in orbit the second is more than ninety percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant thus every time you'd want to do anything in space you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money every time you hit the accelerator not even the guys at tesla can fight that physics so what a place where you can in fact you can get it better you can get it at fourteen times lower if you can find propellant on the moon was a strong hydrogen signature at shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon that signal was so strong it could only have been produced by ten trillion tons of water buried in the sediment collected over millions and billions of years by the impact of asteroids and comet material if we're going to get that and make that gas station possible we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space we can't do that right now the way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack that has to be launched from the ground and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces we have to beat that we can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics we can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything this is an idea that again to just about everything bob bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit we can go much further we can build space tugs orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water there's another thing when you're coming back from the moon you have to deal with orbital mechanics it says you're moving ten thousand feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station you got two choices you can burn rocket fuel to get there or you can do something really incredible but we also value esprit de corps and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter personal conflict while under great stress in remote locations the traditional approach to space exploration has been that you carry all the fuel you need to get everybody back in case of an emergency if you try to do that for the moon you're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there but if you send a mining team there without the return propellant first this is not like that i'm much more like scotty i like this equipment you know and i really value it so we're not going to burn the gear but if you were truly bold you could get it there manufacture it and it would be the most dramatic demonstration that you could do something worthwhile off this planet that has ever been done that's not true in seven years we could pull off an industrial mission to shackleton and demonstrate that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low earth orbit the orbital refueling stations i've just described could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key for opening space to the general exploration to bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed we can do it by jump starting with an industrial lewis and clark expedition to shackleton crater like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at ted i intend to lead that expedition,1
59,BillStrickland_2002.sph.wav,i i can't get these parents to come to the school he said i 'll get them to to sign a piece of paper that says you can art opening but you probably didn't have one children at the manchester craftsmen 's guild because there is no statistical difference between the white parents so for the remaining two years of my high school have to i even stuck just got this slide i gave this little slide show at a place and i did all right and the woman came out of the audience she said that was a great story and i was very criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old and i said well what do you do for a living you that hp and a furniture company called steelcase have adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology and all you so it's kind of the world debut of our digital imaging center i only have a couple more slides and this is where the story gets kind so i just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes and and a guy named dizzy gillespie showed up to play there because he knew this man over here marty ashby and i stood on that stage with dizzy gillespie on sound on a wednesday afternoon and i said dizzy why would you come to a black run center in the middle of an industrial park with a high crime rate that doesn't even have a reputation in music he said because i heard you built the center and i didn't believe that you i wanted to see for myself and i have i want to give you a gift i said you 're the gift he said no sir and i recorded dizzy and he died a year later and and a band called the count basie orchestra guy named gary burton all have come to this center in the middle of an industrial park the greatest artists and i don't want it on my conscience but not before his last recording was school and i'm taking you with when the basie band came the band got so excited about the school they voted to give me the rights to the music he drove me out to the university of pittsburgh where i filled out a college application jazz orchestra dropped and we recorded them and got nominated for a second grammy back to back hot city with a high crime place all filled up with bomb on that room you'd have wiped out all the money in including my mother and father just like and he was was our first recording studio which was and i can now tell you with absolute certainty an appearance on oprah winfrey will sell ten thousand cds we are currently number four on the billboard charts right tony bennett and i think we're going to be this was burned out during the riots this is next to my building and so i had another cardboard box built and i walked back out on the streets again and that's the building and that's the model and on the right 's the high tech greenhouse and in the middle 's the medical technology building and i'm very pleased to tell you that the the guy who came from the neighborhood a great honor to be here also every building the university of pittsburgh medical center are anchor tenants and they took half the building and we now train medical technicians through all their system and mellon bank 's a tenant and i love them because they pay the rent on who got into the place on probation don't give up on the poor kids because you never know what's going to happen to those children that and you will see the greenhouse that's going to open in october this year because we're going to we have a handshake with one of the large retail grocers to sell our orchids in all two hundred and forty and our partners are zuma canyon orchids which he readily agreed and we got the funding this is what i want to do when i grow up the brown building is the one you guys have been looking at and i'll tell you where i made my in life i had a chance to buy this whole industrial park which is less than one thousand feet from the riverfront for four million dollars and i didn't do it and i built the first building and guess what happened i appreciated the real estate values beyond everybody 's expectations and the owners of the park turned me down for eight i'm going to show you for a couple of minutes and said mister strickland this is in a place called the reason this picture 's in here i did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me he said man that's a great story i want one what do you do for a living he says i willie brown and so i kind of the flattery and the praise and put it out of my mind and that weekend i was going back home and herbie hancock was playing at our center that and he said as god is i've had a center like this in my mind for twenty five years and you've built it and now i really he chance you know willie brown as a matter of fact he did know willie brown and willie brown and herbie and i four years ago and we started drawing out that center on the one is called bidwell training willie brown said as sure as he got me five acres of land on san francisco bay we got an architect and we got a general contractor and we got herbie on the board center it is a vocational school for ex steel workers and and our friends from hp and our friends from steelcase and our friends from cisco and our friends from wells fargo and and along the way i met this real short slide show in the silicon valley to me afterwards he said man that's a fabulous story i want to help you and i said well thank you very much for that what do you do for a living he said well very nice thanks very much and give me your card and sometime we'll talk i didn't know ebay from that jar of water sitting on that piano but i had the presence of mind to go back and talk to one of the techie kids at my center i said hey man what is ebay he said well that's the electronic commerce network the and he left me his card so i called him up on the phone and i said mister skoll i've come to have a much deeper appreciation of who you are jeff and i did become friends the good news is i'm very aware of my responsibilities to get you out and he 's organized a team of and we're going to build this and i went down into the neighborhood called bayview hunters point and i said the mayor sent me down to work with you and i want to build a center with you but i'm not going to build you anything if you and so two hundred very angry and i started showing these pictures and after about ten pictures they all settled down of the room a woman stood up and she said in thirty five come down here and she turned that audience around on a pin and i i think we can get in the ground this year the first replication of the center and said i want to help you man let 's do one in l a and so he 's people and i've fallen in love with him as i have with herbie and with said where did the idea for centers like this come from because mister ross used to bring in your albums when i was sixteen years old when the world was all dark that's not true i believe in your hopes and your dreams i believe in your intelligence and i believe in your and i'm tired of going into town after town with people standing around on corners with eyes used to be their spirits damaged we won 't make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around and pennsylvania it costs sixty thousand dollars to keep people in jail most of whom look like me forty thousand dollars to build the university of pittsburgh medical school it's twenty thousand dollars cheaper to very decent people i think we can build these all over the country and i believe we can turn this whole story around to one of celebration in my business it's very difficult work you're always fighting upstream like never enough money too much and so there is a tendency to have an occupational depression that accompanies my work and so i've figured out the solution to the depression you make a friend made a few and in very close as and last year i spoke at his memorial service the only thing standing between you i went out and hired a student of frank lloyd wright built in a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for the life of look like the solution and not the problem as you can it and the good news is their courtyard i noticed that they had a life before you ever give them a speech and in my view is this kind of we also created a boardroom and i hired a japanese cabinetmaker from kyoto japan and commissioned him to do sixty pieces of furniture for our custom furniture for rich people and i got sixty pieces out of it for my because i felt that welfare to come to a school where there was handcrafted furniture because it sets a tone and an attitude about how you feel about people long before you give them the speech even have flowers in the hallway and they're not plastic those and we were particularly touched by the flowers and we were curious as to how the flowers got there i said well i got in my car and i went out to the what you need to know is that the children and the adults deserve flowers in their life people remember pictures long after they've we believe in hope and human possibilities and so the next thing you'll see a a million heard about my desire to build a new building because i had a cardboard box and i put it in a garbage bag and i walking all over pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site and he called me into his office which is the equivalent of going to see the wizard of john heinz had six hundred million dollars and at the time i had about he said but we've heard about you we've heard about your work with the kids and the ex steel workers and we're inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building and you could do us a great service if you would add a culinary program to your program because back then we were building a trades program he said that way we could fulfilll our affirmative action goals go into a field that i don't know much about but i promise you that if you'll support my school i'll get it built and in a couple of years i'll come back and weigh out that program that you desire said well what would your reaction be i said senator it appears that we're going into the food training business and john heinz did give me a million and most importantly he loaned me the head of research for the heinz company and we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the culinary institute of america which in their mind is kind of the harvard in this million dollar kitchen that happens to be our cafeteria pastry day why because the students made puff pastry and that's what the school ate every day the concept was that i wanted to take the stigma good food 's not for rich people good food 's for everybody on the planet and there's no excuse why we can't all be eating it so at we subsidize a gourmet lunch program for welfare in a tough neighborhood i wanted to let them know every day black kids and white and no sophistication no class no dignity no history what we've discovered is the only thing wrong with poor people is they don't have any money wednesday afternoon i was walking down happens to be a curable condition it's all in the way that you think about people that often determines by a student after seven months in the program done by a very brilliant young woman who was taught by our actually eaten seven of those baskets and they're very that's our dining room it looks like your average high school cafeteria in your average town this is my we train medical technicians for the medical industry and we train chemical technicians for companies like bayer and calgon carbon and fisher scientific and exxon and i will guarantee you that if you come to my center in pittsburgh welfare mothers doing analytical chemistry with logarithmic calculators ten months from people can't learn world class technology what we've discovered you have to give and i have children with high school diplomas that they can't read in the twenty one st century that we graduate children from schools who can't read the diplomas that they the reason is that the system gets reimbursed for the kids they spit out at the other end not the children i can take these children and in twenty weeks demonstrated aptitude the four hundred kids from the pittsburgh public school system that for arts education and these are children last year i put eighty eight percent of those kids in college and i've averaged over for fifteen years we've made a fascinating never seen anything like that before and that i figured that if treat children like human beings it increases the likelihood they're going to behave that way and why we can't institute in every school and in every city let me show you what the art room and i said what is that and he said ceramics and who are you in fact i brought in a mosaic artist from the vatican an african american woman who had studied the old vatican mosaic techniques and let me show you what sunlight teach photography four we have a world class gallery because we believe that so i designed this thing we have smoked salmon at the and i even have figured out a way to get their parents to come i couldn't buy a parent fifteen years ago so i hired a guy who got off,1
60,BillyGraham_1998.sph.wav,but death is inevitable i spoke some time ago to a joint session of congress last year and we were meeting in that room why they have a speaker from the field of religion about three hundred of them and i said there 's one thing that we have in common in this room all of us together whether republican or democrat i said we 're all going to die and we have that in common with all these great men of the past that are staring down at us and it's often difficult for young people to understand that as the ancient writer of ecclesiastes wrote he said there's every activity under heaven there's a time to be born the deathbed of several famous people whom you would know seen them in those agonizing moments when they were scared to and yet a few years earlier death never i talked to a woman this past week richard can answer that was a famous doctor never thought of god never talked about god didn't believe in god he was an atheist as he came to because he made that decision and he said for the first time in his life he'd thought about and about god what is the greatest surprise in your life and i said the greatest surprise in my life is the brevity of life passes so in the aftermath of world war ii concluded quote science and religion are not antagonists on the contrary he put it on a personal basis i knew doctor von braun very well and he said speaking for myself i can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos serves only to confirm a belief in the certainty of a creator he also said in our search to know god i've come to believe that the life of jesus christ should be the focus of our efforts and inspiration the reality of this life and his resurrection is the hope of mankind i've done a lot of speaking in germany and in france and in different parts of the world one hundred and five countries it's been my privilege to speak in and i was invited one day to visit and he once and he said to me he said young man he said do you believe in the resurrection of jesus christ and on that elevator a man said i hear billy graham is staying in this hotel and i said sir i do he said so do i he said when i leave office i'm going to spend my time writing a book on why jesus christ rose again and why it's so important to believe that in one of his plays alexander solzhenitsyn depicts a man dying who says to those gathered around his bed the moment when it's terrible to feel regret is when one is dying how should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying another man looked in my direction and said yes there he is he 's on this elevator with us and this man looked me up and down for about ten seconds and he said my what an at the frontiers of mathematics even as a teenager he is viewed by many as the the probability theory and a creator of the first model of a computer and of course you are all familiar with the computer language named for him he was astounded at the phenomenon we've been considering that yet they also are full of anger hypocrisy and have and self hatreds pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture of genius and self delusion four had a profound he wrote in his journal these i submit myself to jesus christ my redeemer a french historian said two centuries later seldom has so mighty an intellect that his own sins and failures could be forgiven and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven he experienced it in a way that went beyond scientific observation and reason it was he who penned the well known words the heart has its reasons which reason knows not equally well known is pascal 's wager essentially he said this if you bet on open yourself to his love you lose nothing even if you're wrong but if instead you bet that there is no god the knowledge of god was far beyond anything that ever crossed his mind when he died at the age of thirty nine to be seventy a long time in his era yet he too had to face death and he wrote these words i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no for you are with me this was david 's answer to three dilemmas of evil suffering and death and allow him to fill your life when i was seventeen years of age i was born and reared on a farm in north carolina i milked cows every morning and i had to milk the same cows every evening when i came home i hope that you won 't feel that these few moments with me is not a is an anticlimax after all this tremendous and i worked on the farm and tried to keep up with my studies good grades in high school i didn't make them in college until one day i was faced face to face the way the truth and the can you imagine that i am the truth i'm the embodiment of all truth he was a liar or he was insane or he was what he claimed to be i had to make that decision but by faith i said i believe him and he came into my heart when i hear that call to go into the presence of god thank you and god bless all of you on an airplane in the east some years ago and the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of charlotte north carolina his name was john belk some of you will probably know him and there was a drunk man on and he got up out of his seat two or three times and he was making everybody upset by what he was trying to do and he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went and everybody was upset with him and finally john belk said do you know who 's sitting here man and he turned to me and he said he said your sermons have certainly helped and i suppose that that's true with thousands of people i know that as you have been peering into the future and as we've heard some of it here tonight i would like to live in that age and see what is going to be but i because i'm eighty years old this is my and i know that my time is brief i have phlebitis at the moment in both legs and some other problems that i won 't talk about this is not the first time that we've had a technological revolution in one generation the nation of the people of israel a tremendous and dramatic change that made them a great power a man by the name of david came to the throne and king david became one of the great leaders of his generation brilliant poet soldier with strategies in battle and conflict that people study even today but they wouldn't allow the israelis to look into it or to have any but david changed all of and he introduced the iron age to israel and the bible says that david laid up great stores of which archaeologists have found that in present day palestine there are evidences of that generation now instead of crude tools made of sticks and stones israel now had iron as a clergyman and in the course of one generation israel was completely changed the introduction of iron in some ways had an impact you can imagine how out of place there were many problems that technology could not solve and they're still with us and you haven't solved them and i haven't heard anybody here speak to that how do we solve these three problems that i'd like to mention the first one that david saw was human evil how do we solve it and again in the psalms which gladstone said was the greatest book in the world i feel like a fish out of david describes the evils of the human and yet he says he restores my soul have you ever thought about what a contradiction we on one hand we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology as this conference vividly demonstrates we've seen under the hundreds of billions of years out in the future an owl out of the air our battleships our soldiers on a frontier now almost ready to go to war why do we have these wars in every generation and in every part of the world and revolutions we can't get along with other people even in our own families find ourselves in the paralyzing grip of self destructive habits we can't break and injustice and violence sweep our world bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and i was preaching in san jose some time ago and my friend mark kvamme who helped introduce me to this conference even the most sophisticated among us seem powerless to break this cycle i would like to see oracle work on this how do we change man the bible says the problem is within us within our hearts and our souls which we call god and we need to have our souls restored jesus said for out of the heart come evil thoughts false testimonies slander the british philosopher bertrand russell was not a religious man but he said it 's in our hearts that the evil lies and it's from our hearts that it must be plucked out albert einstein mister einstein he didn't have a doctor 's degree because he said nobody was qualified to give him easier to denature plutonium to denature the evil spirit of man brought several ceos and leaders of some of the companies here in the silicon valley to have breakfast with me or i with them and many of you i'm sure have thought about that and puzzled over it you've seen people take beneficial technological advances such as the internet we've heard about tonight and twist them into something the oklahoma city bombing was simple technology the problem is the person or persons using it king david said that he knew the depths of his own soul that included murder yet king david sought god 's forgiveness and said you can restore my soul the bible teaches that we're more than a body and we are that's the part of us that yearns for god or something more we find in technology your soul is that part of you that yearns for meaning in life and which seeks for something beyond this life it's the part of you that yearns really for god i find young people all over the world are searching for something they don't know what it is i speak at many universities oxford i've spoken at all of those universities i'm going to harvard in about three or four no it's about two months from now to give a lecture and the same questions that i was asked the last few times i've been on these few questions i come from why am i here where am i going what's life all about why am i here and i was so stimulated and had such it was an even if you have no religious belief there are times when you wonder that there's something else thomas edison also said when you see everything that happens in the world of science and in the working of the universe you cannot deny that there's a captain on the bridge i went to ambassador dobrynin whom i knew very well and i'd been to russia several times under the communists and they'd given me marvelous freedom that i didn't expect going to sit beside misters and he surprised me with the answer he said talk to her about religion and philosophy that's what she's really interested in i was a little bit surprised but that evening that's what we talked about and it was a stimulating conversation eye opening experience and afterward she said you know i'm an atheist but i know that there's something up there higher than we are the second problem that king david writing the oldest book in the world was job and he said man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward to hear them talk a few months i'll be eighty years of age i admit that i'm very grateful for all the medical advances that have kept me in relatively good health all these years about the world that is yet to come i haven't given a talk in and when you speak as much as i do three or four times a day every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere through technology got some notes here so that which i do sometimes i've got something i can turn to but even here among us in the most advanced society in the world we have poverty and science friends that betray us unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us i've never met a person in the world that didn't have a problem or a worry why do we suffer it's an age old question that we haven't yet david again and again said that he would turn to god he said the lord is my shepherd the problem that david knew he could not solve was death i know that we're near the end of this conference many commentators have said that death is the forbidden subject of our generation most people live as if going to die we see people on our screens marilyn monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person and our many young people think she's they don't know that she's dead or clark gable or whoever it is and some of you may be wondering the old stars they come to life,1
61,BirkeBaehr_2010X.sph.wav,the dirt to make plants grow they do this because they've stripped the soil of all nutrients from growing the same crop over and over again next more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables like to kill weeds and bugs when it rains these chemicals seep into the ground or run off into our waterways i discovered that there's a movement for a better way now a while back i wanted to be an nfl football player i decided that i'd rather be an organic farmer instead my name is birke baehr and i'm eleven years old i have a greater impact on the world this we can all make a difference by making different choices by buying our food directly from local farmers or our neighbors who we've known all our lives what's wrong with our food system first of all i would like to say now bill 's farm and volunteer so i can see up close and personal where the meat i eat comes from i want you to know that i believe kids will eat fresh vegetables and good food my little cousin told his dad that he would rather have the organic toasted o 's cereal because birke said he shouldn 't eat sparkly cereal and that my friends is how we can make a difference one kid at a time so next time you're at the grocery store think local choose organic know your farmer and know your to get their parents to buy stuff that really isn't good for us or the planet little kids especially are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys came from these happy little farms where pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day was this is not i began to look i discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system first there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms that is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory to do something not intended by nature,1
62,BjarkeIngels_2009G.sph.wav,and the buildings they don't only sort of invoke the imagery of the mountains they also operate like mountains they create shelter from the wind they accumulate the solar energy they accumulate the water so they actually transform the entire island into a single ecosystem so we recently presented the master plan and it has gotten approved and this summer we are starting the construction documents of the two first mountains in what's going to be the first carbon neutral island in the cliche of the radical architect is the sort of angry young man rebelling against the establishment or this idea of the misunderstood genius frustrated that the world doesn't fit in with his or her ideas so in a way you can see how the mountain in copenhagen sort of evolved into the seven peaks of azerbaijan with a little luck and some more evolution maybe in ten years it could be the five mountains of on mars thank you rather than revolution we're much more interested in evolution this idea that things gradually evolve by adapting and improvising to the his famous evolutionary tree could almost be a diagram of the way we work as you can see a project evolves through a series of generations of design meetings about architecture quite often just stays on contemplating the final result sort of the architectural object is the latest tower in london a gherkin or a sausage or a at each meeting there's way too many ideas only the best ones can survive and through a process of architectural selection we might choose a really beautiful model or we might have a very functional model we mate them they have sort of mutant offspring and through these sort of generations of design meetings we arrive at a design a very literal way of showing it is a project we did for a library and a hotel in copenhagen the design process was like really tough almost like a struggle for survival but gradually an idea evolved this sort of idea of a rational tower that melts together with the surrounding city but darwin doesn't only explain the evolution of a single idea as you can see sometimes a subspecies branches off and quite often we sit in a design meeting and we discover that this great idea it doesn't really work in this context but for another client in another culture it could really be the right answer to a different question so as a result we never throw anything out we keep our office almost like an archive of architectural biodiversity you never know when you might need it and what i'd like to do now in an act of warp speed story telling is tell the story of how two projects evolved by adapting and improvising to the happenstance of the world the first story starts last year when we went to shanghai to do the competition for the danish national pavilion for the world expo in two thousand and ten and we saw this guy the mascot of the expo and he looks strangely familiar in fact he looked like a building we had designed for a hotel in the north of sweden when we submitted it for the swedish competition we thought it was a really cool scheme but it didn't exactly look like something from the north of sweden the swedish jury didn't think so so we lost but then we had a meeting with a chinese businessman who saw our design and said wow that's the chinese character for the word people so apparently this is how you write people as in the people 's republic of china we even double checked and at the same time we got invited to exhibit at the shanghai creative industry week so recently we asked ourselves if we could invent a format that could actually tell the stories behind the projects maybe combining images and drawings and words to actually sort of so the people 's building as we called it this is our two interpreters sort of reading the architecture it went on the cover of the wen wei po newspaper which got mister liang yu chen the mayor of shanghai to visit the exhibition and we had the chance to explain the project and he said shanghai is the city in the world with most skyscrapers but to him it was as if the connection to the roots had been cut over but like i said haibao looked very familiar because he is actually the chinese character for people and they chose this mascot because the theme of the expo is better city better life sustainability and we thought like sustainability has grown into being this sort of neo protestant idea that is has to hurt in order to do good you know you're not supposed to take long warm showers you're not supposed to fly on holidays because it's bad for the environment you get this idea that sustainable life is less fun than normal life so we thought that maybe it could be interesting to focus on examples where a sustainable city actually increases the quality of life china has many great poets but we discovered that in the people 's republic public school curriculum they have three fairy tales by an tu shung or hans christian anderson as we call him tell stories about architecture and we discovered that we didn't have to invent it it already existed in the form of a comic book so that means that all one point three billion chinese have grown up with the emperor 's new clothes the matchstick girl and the little mermaid it's almost like a fragment of danish culture integrated into chinese culture and it sort of shows the difference between these two cities copenhagen shanghai modern european but then we looked at recent urban development and we noticed that this is like a shanghai street thirty years ago all bikes no cars this is how it looks today all traffic jam bicycles have become forbidden many places we donate one thousand bikes to shanghai so if you come to the expo go straight to the danish pavillion get a danish bike and then continue on that to visit the other pavillions so we thought that these expos quite often have a lot of state financed propaganda images statements but no real experience so just like with a bike we don't talk about it you can try it like with the so we basically copied the format of the comic book so actually we tell the stories of behind the scenes how our projects actually evolve through adaptation and improvisation this is where people normally object that it doesn't sound very sustainable to sail water from copenhagen to china but in fact the container ships go full of good from china to denmark and then they sail empty back so quite often you load water for ballast so we can actually hitch a ride for free and in the middle of this sort of harbor bath we're actually going to put the actual little mermaid so the real mermaid the real water and the real bikes and when she's gone we're going to invite a chinese artist to reinterpret her the architecture of the pavilion is this sort of loop of exhibition and when you go to the exhibition you'll see the mermaid and the pool you'll walk around start looking for a bicycle on the roof jump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo so when we actually won the competition we had to do an exhibition in china explaining the project and to our surprise we got one of our boards back with corrections from the chinese state censorship so when it came out in denmark that we were actually going to move our national monument the national people 's party sort of the turmoil and the opportunities and the incidents of the real world we call this comic book yes is more rebelled against it they tried to pass a law against moving the mermaid so for the first time i got invited to speak at the national parliament in the morning from nine to eleven they were discussing the bailout package how many billions to invest in saving the danish economy but to conclude if you want to see the mermaid from may to december next year don't come to copenhagen because she's going to be in shanghai if you do come to copenhagen you will probably see an installation by ai weiwei the chinese artist but if the chinese government intervenes it might even be a panda so the second story that i'd like to tell is actually starts in my own house this is my apartment this is the view from my apartment over the sort of landscape of triangular balconies that our client called the leonardo dicaprio balcony and they form this sort of vertical backyard where on a nice summer day you'll actually get introduced to all your neighbors in a vertical radius of ten meters which is obviously a sort of evolution of the ideas of some of our heroes in this case it's mies van der rohe 's less is more he triggered the modernist revolution the house is sort of a distortion of a square block trying to zig zag it to make sure that all of the apartments look at the straight views instead of into each other because copenhagen is completely flat if you want to have a nice south facing slope with a view you basically have to do it yourself then we sort of cut up the volume so we wouldn't block the view from my apartment and essentially the parking is sort of occupying the deep space underneath the apartments and up in the sun you have like a single layer of apartments all the splendors of a suburban lifestyle like a house with a garden with a sort of metropolitan view and a sort of dense urban location this is our first architectural model this is an aerial photo taken last summer and essentially the apartments cover the parking they are accessed through this diagonal and after him followed the post modern counter revolution robert venturi saying less is a bore after him philip johnson sort of introduced the facade of the parking we wanted to make the parking naturally ventilated so we needed to perforate it and we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes we could actually turn the entire facade into a gigantic naturally ventilated rasterized image so if you go back into the parking into the corridors it's almost like traveling into a parallel universe from into this sort of south facing urban oasis the wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades if you go even further it turns into and all the rainwater that drops on the mountain is actually accumulated and there is an automatic irrigation system so the mountain is like our first built example of what we like to refer to as architectural alchemy this idea that you can actually create if not gold then at least added value by mixing traditional ingredients like normal apartments and normal parking and in this case actually offer people the chance that they don't have to choose between a life with a garden or a life in the city they can actually have both as an architect it's really hard to set the agenda you can't just say that now i'd like to do a sustainable city in central asia because that's not really how you get commissions you always have to sort of adapt and improvise to the opportunities and accidents that happen and the sort of turmoil of the world one last example is that recently we like last summer we won the competition to design a nordic national bank this was the director of the bank when he was still smiling it was in the middle of the capital so we were really excited by this opportunity unfortunately it was the national bank of iceland at the same time we actually had a visitor a minister from azerbaijan came to our office we took him to see the mountain and he got very excited by this idea that you could actually make mountains out of architecture because azerbaijan is known as the alps of central asia so he asked us if we could actually imagine an urban master plan on an island outside the capital that would recreate the silhouette of the seven most significant mountains of azerbaijan so we took the commission and we made this small movie that i'd like to show we quite often make little movies we always argue a lot about the soundtrack but in this case it was really easy to choose the song so basically baku is this sort of crescent bay overlooking the island of zira the island that we are planning almost like the diagram of their flag our main idea was to sort of sample the seven most significant mountains of the topography of azerbaijan and reinterpret them into urban and architectural structures inhabitable of human life and what we'd like to say with yes is more is basically trying to question this idea that the architectural avant garde is almost always negatively defined as who or what we are against it has no vegetation it has no water it has no energy no resources so we actually sort of designed the entire island as a single ecosystem exploiting wind energy to drive the desalination plants and to use the thermal properties of water to heat and cool the buildings and all the sort of excess freshwater wastewater is filtered organically into the landscape gradually transforming the desert island into sort of a green lush landscape so you can say where an urban development normally happens at the expense of nature in this case it's actually creating nature,1
63,BjornLomborg_2005.sph.wav,the obvious question would be to ask what do you think are the biggest things where should we start on solving these problems but that's a wrong problem to ask that was actually the problem in davos in january but of course there's a problem in asking people to focus on problems because what i'd like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world i'm not going to talk about the skeptical environmentalist probably that's also a good choice to communicable diseases it might be health clinics or mosquito nets to conflicts it would be u n s peacekeeping forces and so on the point that i would like to ask you to try to do is just in thirty seconds and i know this is in a sense an impossible task write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities and also and that 's of course where economics gets evil to put down what are the things we should not do first what should be at the bottom of the list please just take thirty seconds perhaps talk to your neighbor and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world 's biggest issues the amazing part of this process and of course i mean i would love to i only have eighteen minutes i've already given you quite a substantial amount of my these discussions afterwards to think about how do we actually prioritize of course you have to ask yourself why on earth was such a list never done before and one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable but i am going talk about what are the big problems in the world and i must say before i go on i should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because i'm actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that so get out your pen and paper spots on the list than there is number ones it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list we've had the u n for almost sixty years yet we've never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world and said which of them should we do first so it doesn't mean that we are not prioritizing any decision is a prioritization so of course we are still prioritizing if only implicitly and that's unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization and went in and talked about so what i'm proposing is really to say that we have for a very long time had a situation when we've had a menu of choices there are many many things we can do out there not had the prices nor the sizes we have not had an idea imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card but you have no idea what the price is you know you have a pizza you've no idea what the price is it could be at one dollar it could be one thousand dollars it could be a family size pizza it could be a very individual size pizza right we'd like to know these things and that is what the copenhagen consensus is really trying to do to try to put prices on these issues and so basically this has been the copenhagen consensus process we got thirty of the world 's best economists three in each area so we have three of world 's top economists write about climate change what can we do what will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that likewise in communicable diseases three of the world 's top experts saying what can we do what would be the price what should we do about it and what will be the outcome and so on then we had some of the world 's top economists of the world 's top economists including three nobel laureates meet in copenhagen in may two thousand and four we called them the dream team the cambridge university call them the real madrid of economics that works very well in europe but it doesn't really work over here and what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list and then you ask why economists and of course i'm very happy you asked that question because that's a very good question the point is of course if you want to know about malaria you ask a malaria expert if you want to know about climate you ask a climatologist but if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first you can't ask either of them because that's not what they do that is what economists do they prioritize they make that bottom line is there is a lot of problems out there in the world i'm just going to list some of them there are eight hundred million people starving there's a billion people without clean drinking water in some ways disgusting task of saying which one should we do first and which one should we do afterwards so this is the list and this is the one i'd like to share with you of course you can also see it on the website and we'll also talk about it more i'm sure as the day goes on they basically came up with a list where they said there were projects where if you invest a dollar you get less than a dollar back then there's fair projects good projects and very good projects and of course it's the very good projects we should start doing i'm going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best as you might see the bottom of the list was climate change this offends a lot of people and that's probably one of the things where people will say i shouldn 't come back reason why they came up with saying that kyoto or doing something more than kyoto is a bad deal is simply because it's very inefficient it's not saying that global warming is not happening it's not saying that it's not a big problem but it's saying that what we can do about it is very little at a very high cost what they basically show us the average of all macroeconomic models is that kyoto if everyone agreed would cost about one hundred and fifty billion dollars a year that's a substantial amount of money that's two to three times the global development aid that we give the third world every year yet it would do very little good all models show it will postpone warming so the idea here really is to say well we've spent a lot of money doing a little good and just to give you a sense of reference the u n actually estimate that for half that amount for about seventy five billion dollars a year we could solve all major basic problems in the world we could give clean drinking water sanitation basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet so we have to ask ourselves do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of and that is really why it becomes a bad project it's not to say that if we had all the money in the world we wouldn't want to do it but it's to say when we don it's just simply not our first priority the fair projects notice i'm not going to comment on all these but communicable diseases scale of basic health services just made it simply because yes scale of basic health services is a great thing it would do a lot of but it's also very very costly again what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation if you look at the good projects a lot of sanitation and water projects came in again sanitation and water is incredibly important but it also costs a lot of infrastructure so i'd like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world the fourth best problem is malaria dealing with malaria the incidence of malaria is about a couple of people get infected every year it might even cost up towards percentage point of gdp every year for affected nations if we invested about thirteen billion dollars over the next four years we could bring that incidence down to half change so on there are many many problems out there in an ideal world we would solve we would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with of course in the long run also to deal with global warming third best one was free trade basically the model showed that if we could get free trade and especially cut subsidies in the u s and europe we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about two thousand four hundred billion dollars a year half of which would accrue to the third world again the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty there's a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition namely the lack of micronutrients basically about half of the world 's population is lacking in iron zinc iodine and vitamin a if we invest about twelve billion dollars we could make a severe inroad into that problem that would be the second best investment that we could do and the very best project would be but we don 't we don't actually solve all problems and if we do not the question i think we need to ask ourselves and that's why it's on the economy session to focus on hiv aids basically if we invest twenty seven billion dollars over the next eight years we could avoid twenty eight new million cases of hiv aids again what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with hiv aids one is treatment the other one is and again in an ideal world we would do both but in a world where we don't do either or don't do it very well we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first and treatment is much much more expensive than prevention so basically what this focuses on is saying we can do a lot more by investing in prevention basically for the amount of money that we spend we can do x amount of good in treatment and ten times as much good in prevention so again what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment at first rate what this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities have you look at your priority list and say did you get it right or did you get close to what we came up with well of course one of the things is climate change again i find a lot of people find it very very unlikely that we should do that we should also do climate change if for no other reason simply because it's such a big problem but of course we don't do all problems there are many problems out there in the world and what i want to make if we actually focus on problems that we focus on the right ones the ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good and i think actually thomas schelling one of the participants in the dream team he put it very very well one of things that people forget is that in one hundred years when we're talking about most of the climate change impacts will be people will be much much richer even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the u n estimate that the average person in the developing world one hundred will be about as rich as we are today much more likely they will be two to four times richer than we are and of course we'll be even richer than that but the point is to say when we talk about saving people or helping people in bangladesh in two thousand one hundred we're not talking about a poor bangladeshi we're actually talking about a fairly rich dutch guy and so the real point of course is to say do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little one hundred years from now a fairly rich dutch guy or do we want to help real poor people right now in bangladesh who really need the help and whom we can help very very cheaply or as schelling put it imagine if you were will be a rich chinese a rich bolivian a rich congolese in two thousand one hundred thinking back on two thousand and five and saying how that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather they could have helped so much more and who needed the help so much more so i think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight even if it doesn't accord to the typical way we see this problem of course that's mainly because climate change has such good pictures we have you know the day after tomorrow it looks great right it's a good film in the sense that i certainly want to see it right but don't expect emmerich to cast brad pitt in his next movie digging latrines in tanzania or something it just doesn't make for as much of a movie so in many ways i think of the copenhagen consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems to spend to do good in this world where should we spend it we identified ten of the biggest challenges in the world to make sure that we realize it's not about making us feel good it's not about making things that have the most media attention but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good the other objections i think that are important to say is that i'm somehow or we are somehow positing a false choice of course we should do all things in an ideal world i would certainly agree likewise people are also saying but what about the iraq war you know we spend one hundred billion dollars why don't we spend that on doing good in the world i'm all for that if any one of you guys can talk bush into doing that that's fine but the point of course is still to say if you get another one hundred billion dollars so the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities i should just mention briefly is this really the right list that we got out just briefly read them climate change communicable diseases conflicts education financial instability governance and corruption malnutrition and hunger you know when you ask the world 's best economists you inevitably end up asking old white american men and they're not necessarily ways of looking at the entire world so we actually invited eighty young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem the only two requirements were that they were studying at the university and they spoke english the majority of them were first from developing countries they had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion and they certainly did to come up with their own lists and the surprising thing was that the list was very similar with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom we've done this many other times there's been many other seminars and university students and different things they all come out with very much the same list and that gives me great hope really in saying that i do believe that there is a to get us to start thinking about priorities and saying what is the important thing in the world of course in an ideal world again we'd love to do everything but if we don't do it then we can start thinking about where should we start i see the copenhagen consensus as a process we did it in two thousand and four and we hope to assemble many more people getting much better information for two thousand and eight two thousand and twelve map out the right path for the world but also to start thinking about political at the end of the day you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these but we have to be honest and frank about saying if there's some things we do,1
64,BlaiseAguerayArcas_2010.sph.wav,but i'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff so we see the imagery of course not stopping sky these little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made i'm not going to dive into them either but photosynths and integrated into the map and so when you fly down thank you when you fly down to the ground and you see this kind of panoramic imagery the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture there's just as much three dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three dimensional city from above so if i click on something to get a closer view of it then the fact that that transition looks as it does is a function of all of that geometry all of that three d understanding behind this model now i'll show you a fun app that thank but what's cool about this is that not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with now i just made a transition indoors that's also interesting okay notice there's now a roof above us we're inside the pike place market and this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera so we're not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars but we're also imaging inside which is microsoft 's online mapping effort in the past two and a half we've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online and from here we're able to do the same sorts of registration not only of still images but also of video so this is something that we're now going to try for the first time live and this is really truly very frightening okay all right guys are you there all right there we go so these are our friends in pike place market the lab they're broadcasting this live okay george can you pan back over to the corner market because i want to show points of interest the other way yeah yeah back to the corner back to the corner i don't want to see you guys yet back to the corner back to the corner back to the and we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to we're doing two different things here one of them is to take that now and walk back outside and while i walk outside i'll just mention that here we're using this for telepresence but you can equally well use this on the spot for augmented reality when you use it on the spot it means that you're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you so here we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it that was being broadcast by the way on a four g network from the market all right and now there's one last ted talk that microsoft has given in the past several years and that's curtis wong worldwide telescope so we're going to head over to the dumpsters where it's traditional after a long day at the market to go out for a break but also stare up at the sky this is the integration of worldwide telescope time but if we scrub the time then we can see how the sky will look at different times and we can get all this very detailed information about different times different dates let 's move the moon a little higher in the sky maybe change the date i would like to kind of zoom in on the moon so this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the earth all right now i've run my time so i've got to stop thank you all very much mapping is of course not just about cartography it's also about imagery so as we zoom in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of sim city like we see this space this three dimensional environment as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out and map 's directions are really just one of them if you click on this you'll see some of the ones that we've put out just in the past couple of months since we've launched so for example a couple of days after the disaster in haiti we an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky this wonderful one which i don't have time to show you is taking hyper local blogs in real time and mapping those stories those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs it's wonderful,1
65,BobThurman_2006S.sph.wav,the wonder of the universe everyone looked in that and they saw in there the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes and of course in the buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets with human life on and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets so they don 't when they look out and they see those lights that you showed in the sky they don't just see sort of pieces of matter burning or rocks or flames or gases exploding they actually see landscapes and human beings and i know his other name told us about interconnection and about how we're all totally interconnected here and how we've all known each other and of course in the buddhist universe we've already done this already billions of times in many many lifetimes in the past and i didn't give the talk always you did and we had to watch you and so forth and we're all still trying to i guess we're all trying to become tedsters if that's a modern form of enlightenment i guess because in a way if a tedster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything it's the forging of a mass awareness of where everybody can really know everything that's going on everywhere in the planet and therefore it will become intolerable what compassion is is where it will become intolerable for us totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying the life of the mind or whatever it is and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease and they cannot have a bite of food and they and i feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me i feel it's sort of like the vimalakirti sutra an ancient work from ancient india in which the buddha appears have no place or they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth it just becomes intolerable with all of us knowing everything we're kind of forced by and of course we all will be deeply disappointed when we do we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do a little bit tired we do suffer we do enjoy our misery in a certain way we distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere but basically we all have this common misery that stuck inside our skins and everyone else is out there and occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin and the two of us enjoy each other and each of us tried to get out of our own and ultimately it fails of course and we're back into this thing because our egocentric perception from the buddha 's point of view misperception is that all we are is what is inside our skin and it's inside and outside self and other and other is all very different and everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception a little bit who 's that and so you wouldn't sit that close to another person because of your notion that it's you versus the universe that's all buddha discovered because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone each of us and everyone else is different then that puts us in an impossible situation doesn't it who is it who 's going to get enough attention from the world who 's going to get enough out of the world who 's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings if you're different from all the other beings so where compassion comes is where you surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way through art through meditation through understanding through knowledge actually knowing that you have no such boundary knowing your interconnectedness with other beings you can experience yourself as the other beings when you see through the delusion of being separated from them at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area when you do that you're forced to feel what they feel luckily they say i still am not sure but luckily they say that when you reach that point because some people have said in the buddhist literature they say ooh who would really want to be compassionate how awful i'm so miserable on my own my head is aching my bones are aching i go from birth to death i'm never satisfied i never have enough even i'm a billionaire i never have enough i need a hundred billion so i'm like that imagine if i had to feel even a hundred other people 's suffering it would be terrible but apparently this is a strange paradox of life when you're no longer locked in yourself and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge of the nature of the world that enables you to let your mind spread out and empathize and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing and realizing that you are the other being somehow by that opening you can see the deeper nature of life and to bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make offering to song that song a perfect teaching but when we're relieved from that we somehow then become interested in all the other beings and we feel ourselves differently it's totally when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion it's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures are finally too small a theater for your intelligence it's really the young people actually from the city the old fogeys don't come because they're mad at buddha because when he came to their city he accepted he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him from whoever it is like this or like that or what you know and the more you focus on how you feel by the way the worse it gets like even when you're having a good time when is the good time over the good time is over when you think how good is it and then it's never good enough i love that said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time doing it by having a good time i think the dalai lama should have heard that i wish he'd been there to hear that he once told me he looked kind of sad he worries very much about the haves and have nots he said well a hundred years ago they went and took everything away from the haves you know the big communist revolutions russia and china and so forth they took it all away by violence saying they were going to give it to everyone and then they were even worse they didn't help at all so what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today and so then he looks at me so i said well you know you're all in this yourself you teach it's generosity was all i could think of what is virtue but of course i think the key to saving the world the key to compassion is that it is more it should be done by fun generosity is more fun that's the key everybody has the wrong idea they think buddha was so boring and they're so surprised when they meet dalai lama and he 's fairly jolly even though his people are being genocided and believe me he feels every blow on every old nun 's head in every chinese prison he feels it he feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays i won 't even say what they do but he feels it and yet he 's very jolly he 's extremely jolly because when you open up like that then you can't just what good does it do to add being miserable with others misery you have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is how it can be changed look at that beautiful thing chiho showed us she scared us with the lava man she scared us with the lava man is coming the tsunami is coming but then finally there was flowers and trees and it was very beautiful it's really lovely so compassion means to feel the feelings of others and the human being actually is compassion the human being is almost out of time the human being is compassion because what is our brain for jim 's brain is memorizing the almanac but he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is he will he did he could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings and he would have tremendous fun doing that so the first person who gets happy when you stop focusing on the self centered situation of how happy am i where you're always dissatisfied as mick jagger told us never get any satisfaction that way so then you decide well i'm sick of myself i'm going to think of how other people can be happy and the first person who gets happy when you do that you don't do anything for anybody else but you get happier you yourself because your whole perception broadens and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it and you realize that this being with these people is the flower garden that chiho showed us it is nirvana and my time is up and i know the ted commandments thank you and so they boycotted him they wouldn't go listen to him but the young people all came and they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol and they put it on the ground and as soon as they had laid all these all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient india he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium,1
66,BonnieBassler_2009.sph.wav,the earth we've also made pro quorum sensing molecules so we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better remember you have these ten times or more bacterial cells in you or on you keeping you healthy what we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you in the hopes of making you more healthy making those conversations better so bacteria can do things that we want them to do better than they would be on their own at the best you're ten percent human but more likely about one percent human depending on which of these metrics you like i know you think of yourself as human beings but i think of you as ninety or ninety nine percent bacterial i hope when you learn things like about how the natural world works i just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child science is done by that demographic all of those people are between twenty and thirty years old and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country it's a really lucky demographic to work with i keep getting older and older they digest our food they make our vitamins they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out so they do all these amazing things that help us and are vital for keeping us alive that have no business being in you or on you at any time and if they are they make you incredibly sick so the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do or all the bad things that bacteria do the question we had is how could they do anything at all i mean they're incredibly small you have to have a microscope to see one they live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide and they've always been considered to be these asocial reclusive organisms what you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean named are the oldest living organisms on the earth they've been here for billions of years and what they are are single celled microscopic organisms this bacterium has the special property that it makes light so it makes bioluminescence like fireflies make light we're not doing anything to the cells here we just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room and this is what we see was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light but when the bacteria made light what we noticed is when the bacteria were alone so when they were in dilute suspension they made no light but when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously the question that we had is how can bacteria these primitive organisms tell the difference from times when they're alone and times when they're in a community and then all do something together when it's alone it doesn't make any light but what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules that you can think of like hormones and these are the red triangles and when the bacteria is alone the molecules just float away and so no light but when the bacteria grow and double and they're all participating in making these molecules the molecule the extracellular amount of that molecule increases in proportion to cell number so they are one cell and they have this special property that they only have one piece of dna they have very few genes and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out and when the molecule hits a certain amount that tells the bacteria how many neighbors there are they recognize that molecule and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony that's how bioluminescence works they're talking with these chemical words the reason that vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology again another plug for the and these house the vibrio fischeri cells they live in there at high cell number that molecule is there and they're making light the reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans is because it wants that light the way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid lives just off the coast of hawaii just in sort of shallow knee deep water the squid is nocturnal so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps but then at night it has to come out to hunt on bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in since it's just in those couple feet of water what the squid has developed is a shutter that can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back and it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom which is made by the bacterium exactly matches how much light hits the squid 's back so the squid doesn't make a shadow actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter illuminate itself in an anti predation device so predators can't see its shadow calculate its trajectory and eat it this is like the stealth bomber of the ocean but then if you think about it the squid has this terrible problem because it's got this dying thick culture of bacteria and it can't sustain that and so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep it buries itself in the sand and it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm and when the sun comes up it pumps out like ninety five percent of the bacteria now the bacteria are dilute that little hormone molecule is gone so they're not making light but of course the squid doesn't care it's asleep in the sand and as the day goes by the bacteria double they release the molecule and then light comes on at night exactly when the squid wants it and what we found so this is supposed to be again my bacterial cell is that vibrio fischeri has a protein that's the red box it's an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule the red triangle and then as the cells grow they're all releasing that molecule into the environment so there's lots of molecule there and the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule these are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells when the molecule increases to a certain amount which says something about the number of cells it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light and one cell becomes two and so on and so on they just grow and divide and grow and divide so a kind of boring life except that what i would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous glow in the dark bacterium that lives in the ocean all bacteria have systems like this so now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other they make chemical words they recognize those words and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison we have a fancy name for this we call it quorum sensing they vote with these chemical votes the vote gets counted and then everybody responds to the what's important for today 's talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions but the one that's probably the most important to you they wait they start growing they count themselves with these little molecules and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing that's how it works we also then went to look at what are these molecules these were the red triangles on my slides before this is the vibrio fischeri molecule this is the word that it talks with the left hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria but the right hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species what that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other so these are private secret conversations i know you guys think of yourself as humans and this is sort of how i think of you this man is supposed to represent a generic human being and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body these conversations are for intraspecies communication each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's its language that allows it to count its own siblings we got that far we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors but what we were really thinking about is that most of the time bacteria don't live by themselves they live in incredible mixtures with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria so we went back to molecular biology and started studying different bacteria and what we've found now is that in fact bacteria are multilingual they all have a species specific system they have a molecule that says me but then running in parallel to that is a second system that we've discovered that's generic so they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria it's used by all different bacteria and it's the language of interspecies communication what happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you they take that information inside and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who 's in the minority and who 's in the majority of any given population then again we turn to chemistry and we figured out what this generic molecule is that was the pink ovals on my last slide this is it it's a very small five carbon molecule what the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule so they're all using this molecule for interspecies communication this is the bacterial esperanto a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do we got that far we started to learn that bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language but what we started to think is that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well i've told you that bacteria do have all these social behaviors they communicate with these molecules of course i've also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing we thought what if we made these bacteria so they can't talk or they can't hear couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics of course you've just heard and you already know that we're running out of antibiotics bacteria are incredibly multi drug resistant right now and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use we kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants and so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases we thought well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications just make these bacteria so they can't talk they can't count and they don't know to launch virulence and so that's exactly what we've done and we've sort of taken two strategies the first one is we've targeted the intraspecies communication system so we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules which you saw but they're a little bit different and so they lock into those receptors and they jam recognition of the real thing the hope is that these will be used at broad spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria to finish i'll just show you the this one i'm just using the interspecies molecule but the logic is exactly the same what you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal in this case a mouse it doesn't initiate virulence right away it gets in it starts growing it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules it recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they're going to launch their attack and the animal dies what we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections but we give them in conjunction with our anti quorum sensing molecules so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing but they're a little bit different which i've depicted on this slide and of course it's the dna that counts so here 's all the a t gs and cs that make up your genetic code and give you all your charming characteristics what we now know is that if we treat the animal with a pathogenic bacterium a multi drug resistant pathogenic bacterium in the same time we give our anti quorum sensing molecule in fact the animal lives we think that this is the next generation of antibiotics and it's going to get us around at least initially this big problem of resistance what i hope you think is that bacteria can talk to each other they use chemicals as their words they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we're just now starting to learn about of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular so in the spirit of ted they're doing things together because it makes a difference is that bacteria have these collective behaviors and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals what i would hope that i could further argue to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity bacteria have been on the earth for billions of years humans couple hundred thousand we think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular you have about thirty thousand genes well it turns out you have one hundred times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life we know that the principles and the rules if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well i hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from other by using these two molecules they can say me and they can say you again of course that's what we do both in a molecular way and also in an outward way but i think about the molecular stuff this is exactly what happens in your body again we think that bacteria invented that and you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study the final thing is again just to reiterate that there's this practical part and so we've made these anti quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics but then to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live,1
67,Bono_2005.sph.wav,i have been of late disappointed with the bush administration they started out with such promise on africa they made some really great promises and actually have fulfilled a lot of them but some of them they haven 't they don't feel the push from the ground is the truth but my disappointment has much more perspective when i talk to american people and i hear their worries about the deficit the fiscal well being of their country i understand that but there's much more push from the ground than you'd think if we got organized what i try to communicate and you can help me if you agree is that aid for africa is just great value for money at a time when america really needs it putting it in the crassest possible terms the investment reaps huge returns not only in lives saved but in goodwill stability and security that we'll gain so this is what i hope that you will do if i could be so bold and not have it deducted from my number of wishes what i hope is that beyond individual merciful acts that you will tell the politicians to do right by if you wanted to make a film you needed a mass of equipment and a hollywood budget now you need a camera that fits in your by america and by the world give them permission if you like to spend their political capital and your financial your national purse on saving the lives of millions of people that's really what i would like you to do because we also need your intellectual capital your ideas your skills your ingenuity and you at this conference are in a unique position some of the technologies we've been talking about you invented pushed the boundaries and we'd like you to a lot of people are getting together and working under this umbrella i told you about earlier the one campaign i think they just have one idea in their mind which is where you live in the world should not determine whether you live and a couple of bucks for a blank dvd imagination has been like god is watching what we do when the history books get written i think our age will be remembered for three things really it's just three things this whole age will be remembered for the digital revolution yes the war against terror yes and what we did or did not do to put out the fires some say we can't afford to i say we can't afford not to the ones that ted has offered to grant you see if this is true and i believe it is that the digital world you all created has the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter this should be a piece from the old constraints and that really really excites me i'm excited when i glimpse that kind of thinking that this started out as a wishes most of them impossible some of them impractical and one or two of them certainly immoral business gets to be addictive you know what i mean when somebody else is picking up the anyway here 's number one i wish for you to help build a social movement of more than one million american activists my first wish i believe it's possible a few minutes ago i talked about all the citizens campaigns that are springing up you know there's lots out there and with this one campaign as our umbrella my organization data and other groups have been tapping into the energy and well the enthusiasm that's out there from hollywood into the heartland of america we know there's more than enough energy to power this movement we just need your help in making it happen we want all of you here church america corporate america microsoft america apple america coke america pepsi america nerd america noisy america writ large what i would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints political economic psychological whatever we can't afford to be cool and sit this one out i do believe if we build a movement that's one million americans strong we will have the ear of congress be the first page in condi rice 's briefing book and right into the oval office if there's one million americans and i really know this who are ready to make phone calls who are ready to be on email i am absolutely sure that we can actually change the course of history literally for the continent of africa anyway so i'd like your help in getting that signed up i know john number two i would like one media hit for every person on the planet who is living on less than one dollar a day one billion media hits could be on google could be on aol steve case larry sergey they've done a lot already could be nbc it could be abc actually we're talking to abc today about the oscars we have a film produced by jon kamen at radical media but you know we want we need some airtime for our ideas we need to get the math we need to get the statistics out to the american people i really believe that old truman line that if you give the american people the facts they'll do the right thing and the other thing that's important is that this is not sally struthers this has to be described as an adventure not a burden one by one they step forward a nurse a teacher a homemaker and lives are saved the problem is enormous every three seconds one person dies another three seconds one more the geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world from the as one we can beat extreme poverty starvation aids we need your help one more person letter voice will mean the difference between life and death for millions of people please join us by working together americans have an unprecedented opportunity we can make history we can start to make poverty history one by one by one please visit one at this address we're not asking for your money we're asking for your voice all right i wish for ted to truly show the power of information its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives by connecting every hospital health with which you swept away obstacles that no one knew could even be budged and that's actually what i'd like to talk about today and school in one african country and i would like it to be ethiopia i believe we can connect every school in ethiopia every health clinic every hospital we can connect to the internet that is my wish my third wish i think it's possible i think we have the money and brains in the room to do that and that would be a mind blowing wish to come true i've been to ethiopia as i said earlier it's actually where it all started for me the idea that the internet which changed all of our lives can transform a country and a continent that has hardly made it to analog let alone digital blows my mind but it didn't start was just nine years later that addis ababa was connected by phone to harare which is five hundred kilometers away since then not that much has changed the average waiting time to get a land line in ethiopia is actually about seven or eight wireless technology wasn't dreamt up then anyway i'm irish and as you can see i know how important talking is first though i should probably explain why and how i got to this place it's a journey that started twenty years ago you may remember that song we are the world or do they know it's christmas band aid live aid another very tall was a great moment and it utterly changed my life that summer my wife ali and myself went to ethiopia we went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on we lived in ethiopia for a month working at an orphanage the children had a name for me they called me the girl with the don't ask anyway we found africa to be a magical place big shining continent beautiful royal people anybody who ever gave anything to africa got a lot more back ethiopia didn't just blow my mind it opened my mind anyway on our last day at this orphanage a man handed me his baby and said would you take my son with you he knew in ireland that his son would live and that in ethiopia his son would die it was the middle of that awful famine well i turned him down and was a funny kind of sick feeling but i turned him down and it's a feeling i can't ever quite forget thank you very much as another famous man jerry garcia said what a strange long trip and in that moment i started this journey in that moment i became the worst thing of all i became a rock star with except this isn't the cause is it six and a half thousand africans dying every single day from aids a preventable treatable disease for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy that's not a cause that's an emergency eleven million aids orphans in africa twenty million by the end of the decade that's not a cause an emergency so what we're talking about here is human rights the right to live like a human the right to live period and what we're facing in africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality this is about justice really this is not about charity this is about justice and he should have said what a strange long trip it's about to become at this very moment you are viewing my upper half my lower half is appearing at a different that's right and that's too bad because we're very good at charity americans like irish people are good even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford we like to give and we give a lot look at the response to the tsunami it's inspiring but justice is a tougher standard than charity you see africa makes a fool of our idea of justice it makes a farce of our idea of equality it mocks our pieties it doubts our concern it questions our because there is no way we can look at what's happening in africa and if we're honest conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else as you heard in the film anywhere else not here not here not in america not in europe a head of state that you're all familiar with admitted this to me really true there is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accepted anywhere else other than africa africa is a continent in flames and deep down if we really accepted that africans were equal to us we would all do more to put the fire out we're standing around with watering cans what we really need is the fire brigade you see it's not as dramatic as the tsunami crazy really when you think about it does stuff have to look like an action movie these days to exist in the front of our brain the slow extinguishing of countless lives is just not dramatic enough it would appear anyway i believe that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual rigor in this room i want to argue with you tonight that that's our crisis i want to argue that though africa is not the front line in the war against terror it could be soon every week religious extremists take another african village they're attempting to bring order to chaos well why aren't we poverty breeds despair we know this despair breeds violence we know this in turbulent times isn't it cheaper and smarter to make friends out of potential enemies than to defend yourself against them later the war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty two places at once but still i'm sorry i can't be with you in person i'll explain at another and i didn't say that colin powell said that now when the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won by military might alone maybe we should listen there's an opportunity here and it's real it's not spin it's not wishful thinking the problems facing the developing world afford us in the developed world a chance to re describe ourselves to the world we will not only transform other people 's lives but we will also transform the way those other lives see us and that might be smart in these nervous dangerous times don't you think that on a purely commercial level that anti retroviral drugs great advertisements for western ingenuity and technology doesn't compassion look well on us and let 's cut the crap for a second in certain quarters of the world brand eu brand usa is not at its shiniest the neon sign is fizzing and someone 's put a brick through the window the regional branch managers are getting nervous never before have we in the west been so scrutinized our values do we have any our credibility time and though i'm a rock star i just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub but what really turns me on about technology these things are under attack around the world brand usa could use some polishing and i say that as a fan you know as a person who buys the products but think about it more anti retrovirals make sense but that's just the easy part equality for africa that's a big expensive idea you see the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference what on earth can we all do well much more than we think we can't fix every problem but the ones we can i want to argue we must and because we can we must this is the straight truth the righteous truth it is not a theory the fact is that ours is the first generation that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye look across the ocean to africa and say this and mean it we do not have to stand for this a whole continent written off we do not have to stand for this let me say this without a trace of irony before i back it up to a bunch of ex hippies forget the sixties we can change the world i can 't you can 't as individuals but we can change the world i really believe that the people in this room look at the gates foundation they've done incredible stuff unbelievable stuff is not just the ability to get more songs on mp three players the revolution this revolution is much bigger than that but working together we can actually change the world we can turn the inevitable outcomes and transform the quality of life for millions of lives who look and feel rather like us when i'm sorry to laugh here but you do look so different than you did in haight ashbury in the sixties but i want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for it is the flowering of the seeds you planted in earlier headier days ideas that you gestated in your youth this is what excites me this room was born for this moment is really what i want to say to you tonight most of you started out wanting to change the world most of you did the digital world well now actually because of you it is possible to change the physical and they know much more than i do so why then are we not pumping our fists into the air probably because when we admit we can do something about it we've got to do something about it it is pain in the arse this equality business is actually a pain in the arse but for the first time in history we have the technology we have the know how we have the cash we have the life saving drugs do we have the will i hope this is obvious but i'm not a hippie and i'm not really one for the warm fuzzy feeling i do not have flowers in my hair actually i come from punk rock the clash wore big army boots not but i know toughness when i see it and for all the talk of peace and love on the west coast there was muscle to the movement that started out here you see idealism detached from action is just a dream but idealism allied with pragmatism with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit is very exciting it's very real it's very strong and it's very present in a crowd like you last year at data this organization i helped set up we launched a campaign to summon this spirit in the fight against aids and extreme poverty we're calling it the one campaign it's based on our belief that the action of one person can change a lot but the actions of many coming together as one can change the world well we feel that now is the time to prove we're right there are moments in history when civilization redefines itself we believe this is one we believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides that the wanton loss of life in africa is just no longer who live on planet earth momentum has been building lurching a little but it's building this year is a test for us all especially the leaders of the g eight nations who really are on the line here with all the world in history watching,1
68,BrendaLaurel_1998.sph.wav,things worth doing because they're good things to do and that clear eyed empiricism can help us figure out how to do them so contrary to popular belief there is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values what it would take to get a little girl to put her hands on a computer to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology that little boys have because they play video games we spent two and a half years conducting research we spent another year and a half in advance development then we formed a spin off company and the research phase of the project at interval we partnered with a company called cheskin research and these people and they did not do the incredibly stupid thing of saying to a child of all these things we already make you which do you like best which gives you zero answer that's usable so what we did for the first two and a half years was four things we did an extensive review of the literature in related fields like cognitive psychology spacial cognition gender studies play theory sociology primatology thank you frans de waal wherever you are i love you and i'd give anything to meet you after we had done that with a pretty large team of people and discovered what we thought the salient issues were with girls and boys and playing because after all that's really what this is about we moved to the second phase of our work where we interviewed adult experts in academia some of the people who 'd produced the literature that we found relevant and also we did focus groups with people who were on the ground with kids every day like playground supervisors talked to them then we did what i consider to be the heart of the work interviewed one thousand one hundred children boys and girls ages seven to twelve all over united states except for silicon valley boston and austin because we knew that their little families would have millions of computers in them and they wouldn't be a representative sample and at the end of those remarkable conversations with kids and their best friends across the united states after two years we pulled together some survey data from another ten thousand children drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics for designing computer based products and in fact any kind of products for little girls ages eight to twelve i met with david to talk about what i might do in his company i was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business and supporting my self by being on the speaking circuit and writing books that has now served twenty five million pages and has forty two thousand registered young girl users who spend an average of they visit an average of one and a half times a day spend an average of thirty five minutes a visit and look at fifty pages so we feel that we've formed a successful online community with girls we launched two titles in october rockett 's new school which is the first of a series of products about a character called rockett beginning her first day of school in eighth grade at a brand new place with a blank slate which allows girls to play with the question of what will i be like when i'm older what 's it going to be like to be in high school or junior high school who are my friends to exercise the love of social complexity and the narrative intelligence that drives most of their play behavior and which embeds in it values about noticing that we have lots of choices in our lives and the ways that we conduct ourselves the other title that we launched is called secret paths in the forest that addresses the more fantasy oriented inner lives of girls these two titles both showed up in the top fifty entertainment titles in pc data entertainment titles in pc data in december right up there with john madden football which thrills me to death so we're real and we've touched several hundreds of thousands of little girls now then after twenty years or so in the computer game industry we've made half a billion impressions with marketing and pr for this brand purple moon ninety six percent of them roughly have been positive four percent of them have been other i want to talk about the other because the politics of this enterprise in a way have been the most fascinating part of it really two kinds of negative reviews that we've received one kind of reviewer is a male gamer who thinks he knows what games ought to be and won 't show the product to little girls the other kind of reviewer is a certain flavor of feminist who thinks they know what little girls ought to be having ideas that people didn't think they could sell it's funny to me that these interesting odd bedfellows have one thing in common they don't listen to little girls they haven't looked at children like to play you some voices of little girls from the two and a half years of research that we did actually some of the voices are more recent and these voices will be accompanied by photographs that they took for us of their lives of the things that they value and care about these are pictures the girls themselves never saw but they gave to us this is the stuff those reviewers don't know about and aren't listening to and this is the kind of research i recommend to you who want to do humanistic work yeah my character is usually a tomboy her 's is what else and all those we make newspaper on the computer for a girl 's game also usually they'll have really you and i love a lot of things to do and sometimes i sometimes it gets annoying when you brothers and sisters or brother or sister when they copy you and you get your idea first and they take your idea and they do it themselves she this is the second day in rockett 's life and the reason i'm showing you this is i'm hoping that the scene that i'm going to show you will look familiar and sound familiar now that you've listened to some girls voices just be a giant sexist conspiracy these people aren't that smart there's six billion dollars on the table and you can see how we've tried to incorporate the issues that matter to them in asked me to make sure you knew about awful event occurs rocket gets want to 's so we're going to emotionally navigate if we were playing the game that's what we'd do if at any time during the game we want to learn more about the characters we can go into this hidden hallway and i'll quickly just show you the interface we can for example go find miko 's locker they would go for it if they could figure out how so what is the deal here girls their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility and to play around with the social complexity of their lives i want to make the point that what we're giving girls i think through this effort is a kind of validation a sense of being seen and a sense of the choices that are available in their lives we love them we see them we're not trying to but we're really really happy about who they are it turns out they're really great i want to close by showing you and as we thought about our goals i should say that interval is really a humanistic institution in the classical sense that humanism at its best finds a way to combine clear eyed empirical research with a set of core values that fundamentally love and respect people the basic idea of humanism is the improvable quality of life that we can do good things that there are,1
69,BreneBrown_2010X.sph.wav,and it becomes this dangerous cycle one of the things i think we need to think about is why and how we numb and it doesn't just have to be addiction the other thing we do is we make everything that's uncertain just certain the more afraid we are the more vulnerable we are the more afraid we are this is what politics looks like today there's no discourse anymore we if there's anyone who wants their life to look like this it would be me but it doesn't work because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks which just i hope in a hundred years people will look back and they're hardwired for struggle when they get here and when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand our job is not so say look at her she's my job is just to keep her perfect make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and yale by seventh grade job our job is to look and say you know what you're imperfect and you're wired for struggle but you are worthy of love and belonging that's our job show me a generation of kids raised like that and we'll end the problems i think that we see today we pretend whether it's a bailout an oil spill a recall we pretend like what we're doing doesn't have a huge impact on other people i would say to companies this is not our first rodeo people i was a young researcher doctoral student my first year i had a research professor who said to we just need you to be authentic and real and say to let ourselves be seen deeply seen vulnerably seen to love with our whole to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror when we're wondering can i love you this much can i believe in this this passionately can i be this fierce about is to believe that we're enough because when we work from a place i believe that says i 'm enough here 's the thing if you cannot measure it it does not exist and so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed the life 's messy love it and i'm more of the life 's messy clean it up and so to think that i had found my way to found a career that takes me really one of the big sayings in social work is lean into the discomfort of the work and i'm like knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all a 's that was my so i'll start with this a couple years ago an event planner called me because i was going to do a speaking event and she called and she said so i was very excited i thought you know what this is the career for me because i am interested in some messy topics but i want to be able to make them i want to understand them i want to hack into these things i know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see so where i started was with connection because by the time you're a social worker for ten years what you realize is that connection is why we're here it's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives this is what it's all about it doesn't matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice and mental health know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss and she tells you thirty seven things you do really awesome and one thing an opportunity for growth and all you can think about is that opportunity for growth right well apparently this is the way my work went as well because when you ask people about love really struggling with how to write about you on the little flier and i thought well what's the struggle and she said they tell you about heartbreak when you ask people about belonging they'll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded and when you ask people about connection the stories they told me were about disconnection very quickly really about six weeks into this research i ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that i didn't understand or had never seen and so i pulled back out of the research and thought i need to figure out what this is and it turned out to be shame be worthy of connection the things i can tell you about it it's universal we all have it the only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection no one wants to talk about it and the less you talk about it the more you have well i saw you speak and i'm going to call you a researcher i think but i'm afraid if i call you a researcher no one will come because they'll think you're boring what underpinned this shame this i 'm not good enough which we all know that feeling i 'm not blank enough i'm not thin enough rich enough beautiful enough smart enough promoted enough the thing that underpinned this was idea in order for connection to happen we have to allow ourselves to be seen really seen and you know how i feel about vulnerability i hate vulnerability and so i thought this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick i'm going in i'm going to figure this stuff out i'm going to spend a year i'm going to totally deconstruct shame i'm going to understand how vulnerability works and i'm going to outsmart it so i was ready and i was really excited as you know it's not going to turn out well so i could tell you a lot about shame but i'd have to borrow everyone else's time but here 's what i can tell you that it boils down to and this may be one of the most important things that i've ever learned in the decade of doing this research my one year turned into six years thousands of stories hundreds of long interviews focus groups at one point people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories thousands of pieces of data in six years and i kind of got a handle on it i kind of understood this is what shame is this is how it works who really have a sense of worthiness that's what this comes down to a sense of worthiness they have a strong sense of love and belonging okay and she said and folks who struggle for it and folks who are always wondering if their good enough there was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it and that was the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging the thing i liked about your talk is you're a storyteller so i think what i'll do is just call you a storyteller and of course the academic insecure part of me was like and to me the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we're not worthy of connection was something that personally and professionally i felt like i needed to understand better so what i did is i took all of the interviews where i saw worthiness where i saw people living that way and just looked at what do these people have in common i slight office supply addiction but that's another talk so i had a manila folder and i had a sharpie and i was like what am i going to call this research and the first words that came to my mind were whole hearted these are whole hearted people living from this deep sense of worthiness so i wrote at the top of the manila folder and i started looking at the data in fact i did it first in a four day my husband left town with the kids meaning heart and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart and so these folks had very simply the courage to be imperfect they had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others because as it turns out and she said i 'm going to call you a storyteller and i was like we can't practice compassion with other people if we can't treat ourselves kindly and the last was they had connection and this was the hard part as a result of authenticity they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were to absolutely do that for connection the other thing that they had in common was fully embraced vulnerability they believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful they didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable nor did they talk about it being excruciating as i had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing they just talked about it being necessary they talked about the willingness to say i love you first the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out they thought this was fundamental i personally thought it was betrayal i could not believe i had pledged allegiance to research let me think about this for a second i tried to call deep on my courage and now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability sounds better than breakdown but i assure you it was a breakdown i thought i am a storyteller i'm a qualitative researcher i collect stories and they're like i 'm just saying you know don't bring your measuring stick i brought in my list of the way the whole hearted live and i sat down and she said how are you i'm okay she said what 's going on and this is a therapist because we have to go to those because their b s meters are and so i said here 's the thing i do and maybe stories are just data with a soul and maybe i'm just a storyteller and so i said you know what of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness but it appears that it's also the birthplace of joy of creativity of belonging of love and i think i have a problem and i need some help and i said but here 's the thing no family stuff no childhood shit i just neither good nor bad and it did and it didn 't and it took about a year and you know how there are people that when they realize that's not me and b i don't even hang out with people like say i'm a researcher storyteller for me pushed i pushed back i lost the fight but probably won my life back and so then i went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they the whole hearted what choices they were making and what are we doing with vulnerability why do we struggle with it so much am i alone in struggling with vulnerability so this is what i learned we numb vulnerability we're waiting for the call it was funny i sent something out on twitter and on facebook that says how would you define vulnerability what makes you feel vulnerable and within an hour and a half i had a one hundred and fifty responses because i wanted to know what's out there being turned down asking someone i'm a researcher storyteller and i'm going to talk to you today we're talking about expanding perception and so i want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research we live in a vulnerable world and one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability and i think there's evidence and it's not the only reason this evidence exists but i think it's a huge cause we are the most in debt addicted and medicated adult cohort in u s history the problem is and i learned this from the research that you cannot selectively numb you can't say here 's the bad here 's vulnerability here 's grief here 's shame here 's fear here 's disappointment i don't want to feel these i'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin i don't want to feel these and i know that's knowing laughter i hack into your lives for a living god you can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the affects our emotions you cannot selectively numb so when we numb those we numb joy we numb gratitude we numb happiness and we are miserable and we are looking for purpose and meaning and then we feel vulnerable so then we have a couple of,1
70,BrewsterKahle_2007P.sph.wav,now a lot of these materials so we've got about one hundred thousand pieces up there so and all of the pages on it every two months and actually it's really been pioneered by alexa internet which donates this collection to the internet archive and it's been growing along for the last eleven years and it's a fantastic resource and we've made a way back machine that you can then go and see old of everything ever published everything that was ever meant for distribution available to anybody in the world that's ever wanted to have access to it kind of the way they were if you go and search on something this is google com the different versions of it that we have this is what it looks like when it was an alpha release and this is what it looked like at stanford so anyway you've got basically an idea of where things came from mostly people want to see their old stuff out of this if there's one thing that we want to learn from the library of alexandria version one which is probably best known for burning is don't just have one copy so we've started to we've made another copy of all of this and we actually put it back in the flood zone in amsterdam and in the middle east right so anyway so we're hedging our bets here if we go and put it in a couple more places i think we'll be in good shape there's a political and social question out of this is all of this as we go digital is it going to be public or private there's some large companies that have seen this vision that are doing large scale digitization but they're locking up the public domain the question is is that the world that we really want to live in what's the role of the public versus the private as things go forward how do we go and have a world where we both have libraries and publishing in the future just as we basically benefited as we were growing up so universal access to all knowledge i think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind like the man on the moon or the gutenberg bible or the library of alexandria it could be something that we're remembered for for millennia for having achieved yes there's issues about how money should be distributed and that's still being refigured out but i'd say there's plenty of money and there's plenty of demand so we can actually achieve that and as i said before i'll end with something that's carved above the door of the carnegie library carnegie one of the great capitalists of this country carved above his legacy free to the people thank you very much i'm going to go over the technological social and sort of where are we as a whole trying to get to that particular vision and the way i'm going to try to do this is do it like the amazon com website the books music video and just go step media type by media type just go and say all right how we doing on this so if we start with books where are we well first you have to as an engineer scope the problem how big is it if you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available well how big a problem is it well we don't really know but the largest print library in the world is the library of congress it's twenty six million volumes twenty six million volumes it's by far and away the largest print library in the world and a book if you had a book we really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children is about a megabyte so you know if you had it in microsoft word so a megabyte twenty six million megabytes is twenty six terabytes it goes mega so for the cost of a house or around here a garage you can put you can have spinning all of the words in the library of congress that's pretty neat then the question is what do you get you know is it worth trying to get there do you actually want it online some of the first things that people do is if we don't do that we're going to get the generation we deserve they make book readers that allow you to search inside the books and that's kind of fun and you can download these things and look around them in new and different ways and you can get at them remotely if you happen to have a laptop there's starting to be some of these sort of page turn ee interfaces that look a whole lot like books in certain ways and you can search them make little tabs and it's kind of cute still very book like on your laptop but i don't know reading things on a laptop whenever i pull up my laptop it always feels like work i think that's one of the reasons why the kindle is so great i don't have to feel like i'm at work to read a kindle it's starting to be a little bit more specified but i have to say that there's older technologies that i tend to like i like the physical book and i think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things put them on the net and then download print them and bind them and end up with books again and we sort of said well how hard is this and it turns out to not be very hard we actually went off to make a bookmobile and a bookmobile the size of a van with a satellite dish a printer binder and cutter and kids make their own books it costs about three dollars to download print and bind a normal old book and they actually come out kind of nice looking you can actually get really good looking books for on the order of one penny per page sort of the parts cost for doing this so the idea of this technology actually may end up putting books back in people 's hands again there are some other bookmobiles running around this is eric eldred making books at walden pond thoreau 's works this is just before he got kicked out by the parks for competing with the bookstore there in india they've got another couple bookmobiles running around and this is the opening day at the library of alexandria the new library of alexandria in egypt the elite parents librarians professionals whatever it is a bunch of our activities are in fact in trying to get the best we have to offer within reach was quite popularly attended and kids starting to make their own books and a happy kid with the first book that he 's ever so the idea of being able to use this technology to end up with paper where i can handle sort of sounds a little retro but i think it still has its place and being sort of from the silicon valley sort of utopia and sort of you know world we thought if we can make this technology work in rural uganda we might have something so we actually got some funding from the world bank to try it out and we found in about thirty days we could go and take a couple folks from so the books were in the library we could get it to people if they're digitized but we didn't know how to quite get them digitized everybody thought the answer is send things to india and china and so we've tried that and i'll go over that in a moment there are some newer technologies for delivering that have happened are actually quite exciting as well one is a print on demand machine that looks like a rube goldberg machine we have one of these things now it's completely cool it's all conveyor belt and it makes a and it's called the espresso book machine and in about ten minutes you can press a button and make a book something else i'm quite excited about in this particular domain of those around us or as broadly as we can i'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone one is what's on the boston public library carved above their door is free to all beyond these sort of kiosky things where you can get books on demand is some of these new little and one of my favorites in this is the one hundred dollar laptop and i don't mean to steal any thunder here but we've gone and used one of these things to be an e book reader so here 's one of the units and you can it actually turns out to be a really good looking e book reader and we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it and it turns out that two hundred dots per inch means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good at two hundred dots per inch it's kind of the equivalent of a three hundred dot print laser printer we're in good enough shape you actually can go and read scanned books quite easily so the idea of electronic books is starting to come about but how do you do all this scanning so we thought okay well let 's try out this send books to india thing and there was a project with funded by the national science foundation sent a bunch of scanners and the american libraries were supposed to send books well they didn't they didn't want to send their books so we bought one hundred thousand books and sent them to india and then we learned why you don't want to send books to india the lesson we learned out of this is scan your own books if you really care about books you're going to scan them better especially if they're valuable books if they're new books and you can just you know butcher them because you could just buy another one that's not such a big deal in terms of doing high quality scanning but do things that you love but the indians have been scanning a lot of their own books about three hundred thousand now doing very well the chinese did over a million and the egyptians are about thirty thousand but we sent thought ok if we're going to need to do this let 's do it in library how do we go and do this and how do we get it down so that it's a cost point that we could afford and we sort of picked the price point of ten cents a page if it's basically the cost of xeroxing kind of an inspiring statement and i'll go back at the end of this i'm a librarian and what i'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge to digitize ocr package it up make it so that you could download print and bind it the whole shebang we would have achieved something so we started out trying to figure out how do we get to ten cents and we tried these robot things and they worked pretty well sort of these auto page turning things if we can have mars rovers think you could turn pages but it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages and the volume isn't there so anyway so we ended up making our own book scanner and with two digital high grade professional digital cameras controlled museum lighting so even if it's a black and white book you can go and get the proper intonation so you basically do a beautiful respectful job this is not a fax this is the idea is to do a beautiful job as you're going through these libraries and we've been able to achieve ten cents a page if we run things in volumes this is what it looks like at the university of toronto and actually it turns out to you know pay a living wage people seem to love it yes it's a little boring but some people kind of get into the zen of it and especially if it's kind of interesting books that you care about in languages that you can read we actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this at getting ten cents a page so ten cents a page three hundred pages in your average book thirty dollars a book the library of congress if you did the whole darn thing twenty six million books is about seven hundred and fifty million dollars to as many people as want to read it and the idea of using technology is perfect for us i think we have the opportunity to one up the greeks but a million books i think actually would be a pretty good start and that would cost thirty million dollars that's not that big a bill and what we've been able to do is get into libraries we've now got eight of these scanning centers in three countries and libraries are up for having their books scanned the getty here is moving their books to the ucla which is where we have one these scanning centers and scanning their out of copyright books which is fabulous so we're starting to get the institutional responsibility the thing we're missing is the ten cents if we can get the ten cents all the rest of it flows we've scanned about two hundred thousand books now we're scanning about fifteen thousand books a month and it's starting to gear up another factor of two from there so all in all that's going very well and we're starting to move out of the just out of copyright into the out of print world so i think of we're kind of going from the out of copyright library stuff and amazon com is coming from the in print world and i think we'll meet in the middle some place and have the classic thing that you have which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel and so we're starting up a program to do out of print works but loaning them what loaning means i'm not quite sure but anyway loaning out of print works from the boston public library the woods hole oceanographic institute and a few other libraries that are starting to participate in this program to try out this model of where does a library stop and where does the bookstore take over so all in all it's possible to do this in large scale we're also going back over microfilm and getting that online so we can do ten cents a page we're going fifteen thousand books a month and we've got about two hundred and fifty thousand books online counting all the other projects that are starting to add in so what i wanted to argue is books are within our grasp the idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal yes it costs tens of millions low hundreds of millions but one time shot and we've got basically the history of printed literature online and then there's business model issues about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people but it is within our grasp technologically and law wise at least for the out of print and out of copyright we suggest to be able to get the whole darn thing online now let 's go for audio and i'm going to go through these so how much is there well as best we can tell there are about two to three million disks having been published so seventy eight s long playing records and cds or at least that's the largest archives of published materials we've been able to sort of point at it costs about ten dollars a piece to go and take a disk and put it online if you're doing things in volume and we've been starting to make these available by going and offering shelf space on the net in the united states it doesn't cost you to give something away problem was you actually had to go to alexandria to go to it on other hand if you did then great things happened i think we can one up the greeks right if you give something to a charity or to the public you get a pat on the back and a tax donation except on the net can go broke if you put up a video of your garage band and it starts getting heavily accessed you can lose your guitars or your house this doesn't make any sense so we've offered unlimited storage unlimited bandwidth forever for free bands a day signing up they give permission and we get about forty or fifty concerts a day we have about forty thousand concerts everything the grateful dead ever did up on the net so that people can see it and listen to this material so audio is possible to put up but the rights issues are really pretty thorny we've got a lot of collections now a couple hundred thousand items and it's growing over time that are really meant for a large scale theatrical distribution it's just not that many but half of those were indian but anyway it's doable but we've only found about a thousand of these things that to be and achieve something and i'm going to try to argue only one point today that universal access to all knowledge out of copyright so we've digitized those and made those available but we've found that there's lots of other types of movies that haven't really seen the light of day archival films we've found also a lot of political films a lot of amateur films all sorts of things that are basically needing of a home a permanent home so we've been starting to make these available and it's grown to be very which has just been great fun television comes quite a bit larger we started recording twenty channels of television twenty four hours a day sort of the biggest tivo box you've ever seen it's about a petabyte so far of worldwide television mostly for cost reasons which is the nine eleven sort of from nine eleven two thousand and one for one week what did the world see is within our grasp so if i'm successful then you'll actually come away thinking yeah we could actually achieve the great vision cnn were saying that palestinians were dancing in the streets were they let 's look at the palestinian television and find out how can we have,1
71,BrianCox_2008.sph.wav,building the last piece of atlas so as of today it's finished i'd like to say that i planned that for ted but i didn 't so it's been completed as of today wonderful achievement so you might be asking why why create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began the hundred billion suns in our galaxy and the hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe absolutely everything now you might say well ok but why not just look at it you know if you want to know what i'm made of let 's look at me well we found that as you look back in time the universe gets hotter and hotter denser and denser and simpler and simpler now there's no real reason i'm aware of for that but that seems to be the case this is the large hadron collider it's twenty seven kilometers in circumference it's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted so way back in the early times of the universe we believe it was very simple and understandable all this complexity all the way to these wonderful things human brains are a property of an old and cold and complicated universe back at the start in the first billionth of a second we believe or we've observed it was very simple but as you heat it up it'll melt into a pool of water and you would be able to see that actually it was just made of h twenty water in that same sense that we look back in time to understand what the universe is made of and as of today it's made of these things just twelve particles of matter stuck together by four forces of nature the quarks these pink things are the things that make up protons and neutrons that make up the atomic nuclei in your body the electron the thing that goes around the atomic nucleus held around in orbit by the way by the electromagnetic force that's carried by this thing the photon the quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons and these guys here they're the weak nuclear force probably the least familiar but without it the sun wouldn't shine ten thousand physicists and engineers from eighty five countries around the world have come together over several decades to build this machine up the road relative to the universe it's just up the road so this thing was discovered in the year two thousand so it's a relatively recent picture one of the wonderful things actually i find is that we've discovered any of them when you realize how tiny a step in size from the entire observable universe so one hundred billion galaxies thirteen point seven billion light years away a step in size from that to monterey actually is about the same as from monterey to these things absolutely exquisitely minute and yet we've discovered so one of my most illustrious forebears at manchester university ernest rutherford discoverer of the atomic nucleus once said all science is either physics or stamp collecting what we do is we accelerate protons so hydrogen nuclei around ninety nine point nine nine nine nine nine nine percent the speed of light i don't think he meant to insult the rest of science although he was from new zealand so it's possible what he was that what we've done really is stamp collect there ok we've discovered the particles but unless you understand the underlying reason for that pattern you know why it's built the way it is really you've done stamp collecting you haven't done science fortunately we have this is a little disingenuous because i've expanded it out in all it's gory detail this equation though allows you to calculate everything other than gravity that happens in the universe so you want to know why the sky is blue why atomic nuclei stick together in principle you've got a big enough computer why dna is the shape it is in principle you should be able to calculate it from that equation can anyone see what it is a bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me i'll make it easier actually by blowing one of the lines up basically each of these terms refers to some of the particles so those ws there refer to the ws and how they stick together these carriers of the weak force the zeds the same but there's an extra symbol in this equation h right h h stands for higgs particle that speed they go around that twenty seven kilometers eleven thousand times a second and we collide them with another beam of protons going in the opposite direction so all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation wouldn't be possible without an extra bit so it's a prediction a prediction of a new particle what does it do well we had a long time to come up with good analogies and back in the nineteen eighties when we wanted the money for the lhc from the uk government the whole universe is full of something called a higgs field higgs particles if you will the analogy is that these people in a room are the higgs particles now when a particle moves through the universe it can interact with these higgs particles but imagine someone who 's not very popular moves through the room then everyone ignores them they can just pass through the room very quickly essentially at the speed of light they're massless and imagine someone incredibly important and popular and intelligent heavy in a sense and massive because they're surrounded by higgs particles they're interacting with the higgs field if that picture 's true then we have to discover those higgs particles at the lhc we collide them inside giant detectors they're essentially digital cameras and this is the one that i work on atlas you get some sense of the size you can just see these eu standard size people so that's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine i'm glad you recognize margaret thatcher actually i thought about making it more culturally relevant but so that's one thing that's essentially a guarantee of what the lhc will find there are many other things you've heard many of the big problems in particle physics one of them you heard about dark matter dark energy so the electromagnetic force the force that holds us together gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures the strong force the strong nuclear force which sticks nuclei together gets weaker what you see is the standard model you can calculate how these change is the forces the three forces other than gravity almost seem to come together at one point it's almost as if there was one beautiful kind of super force back at the beginning of time but they just theory called supersymmetry which doubles the number of particles in the standard model which at first sight doesn't sound like a simplification but actually with this theory we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together back at the big bang many other things that the lhc could discover but in the last few minutes i just want to give you a different perspective i think what particle physics really means to me particle physics and cosmology and that's that i think it's given us a wonderful and i'd say that it deserves in the spirit of wade davis talk to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high andes and the frozen north this is a creation story i think equally as wonderful the story goes like this we know that the universe began thirteen point seven billion years ago in an immensely hot dense state much smaller than a single atom the size forty four meters wide twenty two meters in diameter seven thousand tons and we re create the conditions that were present after the big bang gravity separated away from the other forces the universe then underwent an exponential expansion called inflation in about the first billionth of a second or so the higgs field kicked in and the quarks and the gluons and the electrons that make us up got mass the universe continued to expand and cool after about a few minutes there was hydrogen and helium in the universe that's all the universe was about seventy five percent hydrogen twenty five percent helium it still is today to expand about three hundred million years then light began to travel through the universe it was big enough to be transparent to light and that's what we see in the cosmic microwave background that george smoot described as looking at the face of god so the elements of life carbon and oxygen and iron all the elements that we need to make us up were cooked in those first generations of stars fuel exploded threw those elements back into the universe they then re collapsed into another generation of stars and planets and on some of those planets the oxygen which had been created in that first generation of stars could fuse with hydrogen to form water liquid water on the surface on at least one less than a billionth of a second after the universe began up to six hundred million times a second inside that detector immense numbers and on maybe only one of those planets primitive life evolved which evolved over millions of years into things that walked upright and left footprints about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of tanzania and eventually left a footprint on another world and built this civilization this wonderful picture that turned the darkness into light and you can see the civilization from space as one of my great heroes carl sagan said these are the things and actually not only these but i was looking around these are the things like saturn v rockets and sputnik and dna and literature and science these are the things that hydrogen atoms do when given thirteen point seven billion years carbon and oxygen wouldn't be stable inside the hearts of stars and there would be none of that in the universe and i think it makes me really feel that that civilization which as i say if you believe the scientific creation story emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics and a few hydrogen atoms then i think to me anyway it makes me feel incredibly valuable see those metal bits there those are huge magnets that bend electrically charged particles so it can measure how fast they're traveling this is a picture about a year ago so that's the lhc the lhc is certainly when it turns on in summer going to write the next chapter of that book and i'm certainly looking forward with immense excitement to it being turned on thanks those magnets are in there and again an eu standard size real person so you get some sense of the scale and it's in there that those mini big bangs will be created sometime in the summer this year and actually this morning i got an email saying that we've just finished today,1
72,BrianCox_2010S.sph.wav,sent back by the cassini space probe around saturn after we'd finished filming wonders of the solar system so it isn't in the series the moon enceladus so that big sweeping white sphere in the corner is saturn which is actually in the background of the picture and that crescent there is the moon enceladus which is about as big as the british isles it's about five hundred km in diameter so tiny moon what's fascinating and beautiful this an unprocessed picture by the way i should say it's black and white straight from saturnian orbit what's beautiful is you can probably see in the limb there some faint sort of wisps of almost smoke we live in difficult and challenging economic times of course and one of the first victims of difficult economic times i think is public spending of any kind that's fascinating and beautiful in itself but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon and what's important about that is that on our planet on earth wherever we find liquid water we find life so to find is really quite astounding so what we're saying essentially is maybe that's a habitat for life in the solar system just a few hundred kilometers above the surface and so this again a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space absolutely beautiful but that's not the prime candidate for life in the solar system that's probably this place which is a moon of jupiter europa and again we had to fly to the jovian system to get any sense that this moon as most moons but by measure the way that europa interacts with the magnetic field of jupiter and looking at how those cracks in the ice that you can see there on that graphic move around we've inferred very strongly that there's an ocean of liquid surrounding the entire surface of europa so below the ice there's an ocean of liquid around the whole moon it could be hundreds of kilometers deep we think we think it's saltwater and that would mean that there's more water on that moon of jupiter than there is in all the oceans of the earth combined but certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending for science and particularly curiosity led science and exploration so that place a little moon around jupiter is probably the prime candidate for finding life on a moon or a body outside the earth that we know of tremendous and beautiful discovery our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful it may also have pointed the way to answering one of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask which is are we alone in the universe turbulent year the student riots in paris the height of the vietnam war the reason many people think that about this picture and al gore has said it many times actualy on the stage at ted is that this picture arguably was the beginning of the environmental movement because for the first time we saw our world not as so i want to try and convince you in about fifteen minutes that that's a ridiculous and ludicrous thing to do but i think to set the scene well a solid immovable kind of indestructible place but as a very small fragile looking world just hanging against the blackness of space what's also not often it cost a lot didn't it well actually many studies have been done about the economic effectiveness the economic impact of so the apollo program paid for itself in inspiration in engineering achievement and i think in inspiring young scientists and engineers fourteen times over so exploration can pay for itself what about eighteen eighties eighteen nineties many scientists many observers looked at the light given off from atoms and they saw strange pictures like this you put it through a prism is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn't just glow like a white light it just emits light at particular colors a red one a light blue one i want to show the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst ted slide in the history of ted but it is a bit of a mess now that led to an understanding of atomic structure because the way that's explained is atoms are a single nucleus with electrons going around them and the electrons can only be in particular places and when they jump was one of the key drivers that led to the development of the quantum theory the theory of the structure of atoms i just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable this is actually a picture of the spectrum of the sun but look at the number of black lines in that spectrum and the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the sun helios from the sun now that sounds esoteric and indeed it was an esoteric pursuit but the quantum theory quickly led to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials like silicon for example but actually it's not my fault it's from the guardian newspaper and it's actually a beautiful demonstration of how much science costs because if i'm going to make the case for continuing to spend on curiosity driven science we wouldn't have transistors we wouldn't have silicon chips we wouldn't have pretty much the basis of our modern economy there's one more i think wonderful twist to that in wonders of the solar system we kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal it's one of the most incredible things about the physics imposed on the mass of stars you can work it out on a piece of paper in laboratory get a telescope swing it to the sky and you find that there are no dead stars bigger than one point four times the mass of the sun this is the picture of a galaxy a common our garden galaxy with what one hundred billion stars like our sun in it it's just one of billions of galaxies in the universe there are a billion stars in the galactic core which is why it's shining out so brightly this is about fifty million light years away so one of our neighboring galaxies but that bright star there is actually one of the stars in the galaxy so that star is also fifty million light years away that's an incredible phenomena because it's a star that sits there it's called a carbon oxygen dwarf it sits there about say one point three times the mass of the sun and it has a binary companion that goes around it so a big star a big ball of gas and what it does is it sucks gas off its companion star until it gets to this and then it explodes and it explodes and it shines as brightly as a billion suns for about two weeks and releases not only energy but a huge amount of i should tell you how much it costs so this is a game called spot the science budgets this is the u k government spend you see there it's about six hundred and twenty billion a year the science budget is actually if you look i think that's a remarkable demonstration of the power and beauty and universality of the laws of physics because we understand that process because we understand the structure of atoms i certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world 's first antibiotic now the explorers of the world of the atom did not intend to invent the transistor and they certainly didn't intend to so i think science can be serendipity is important it can be beautiful it can reveal quite astonishing things it can also i think finally reveal the most profound ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet this is a spectacular picture or our home planet now it doesn't look like it looks like saturn because of course it is it was taken by the cassini space probe but it's a famous picture not because of the beauty and majesty of saturn 's rings to your left there's a purple set of blobs and then yellow set of blobs and it's one of the yellow set of blobs but actually because of a tiny faint blob just hanging underneath one of the rings and if i blow it up there you see like a moon but in fact it's a picture of earth it was a picture of earth captured in that frame of saturn that's our planet from seven hundred and fifty million miles away the voyager spacecraft and that's a picture of me in front of it for scale the voyager is a tiny machine it's currently ten billion miles away from very hard to see the earth there it's called the pale blue dot picture but earth is suspended in that shaft of light that's earth from four billion miles away and i'd like to read you what sagan wrote about it just to finish because i cannot say around the big yellow blob it's about three point three billion pounds per year out of six hundred and twenty billion that funds everything in the u k from medical research space exploration words as beautiful as this to describe what he saw in that picture that he had taken he said consider again that that's here that's home that's us on it everyone you love everyone you know everyone you've ever heard of every human being who ever was lived out their lives the aggregates of joy and suffering thousands of confident religions ideologies and economic doctrines every hunter and forager every hero and coward every creator and destroyer of civilization every king and peasant every young couple in love every mother and father hopeful child inventor and explorer every teacher of morals every corrupt politician to me it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot the only home we've ever known where i work at cern in geneva particle physics engineering even arts and humanities funded from the science budget which is that three point three billion that little tiny yellow blob around the orange blob at the top left of the screen the turn of the nineteenth century just exploit it just build things he said this he said nothing is more fatal to the progress of the human mind that our views of science are ultimate that our triumphs are complete that there are no mysteries in nature and that there are no new worlds to conquer thank you,1
73,BrianGreene_2005.sph.wav,in cern geneva switzerland a machine is being built called the large hadron collider it's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel opposite directions near the speed of light every so often those particles will be aimed at each other so there's a head on collision the hope is that if the collision has enough energy it may eject some of the debris from the collision from our dimensions after the collision than before this will be evidence that the energy has drifted away and if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there let me show you that idea visually so imagine we a certain kind of particle called a graviton that's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out if the extra dimensions are real but here 's how the experiment will go you take these particles you slam them together you slam them together and if we are right some of the energy of that collision will go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions so this is the kind of experiment that we'll be looking at in the next five seven to ten years or so and if this experiment bears fruit if we see that kind of particle ejected theory of gravity in the late sixteen hundreds that works well describes the motion of planets the motion of the moon and so forth by noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions than when we began this will show that the extra dimensions are real and to me this is a really remarkable story and a remarkable opportunity going back to newton with absolute space didn't provide anything but an arena a stage in which the events of the universe take place einstein comes along and says well space and time can warp and curve that's what gravity is and now string theory comes along and says yes gravity quantum mechanics electromagnetism all together in one package but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see and this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime the motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees hitting people on the head all of that could be described using newton 's work but einstein realized that newton had left something out of the story because even newton had written that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity he'd been unable to figure out how it really works how is it that the sun ninety three million miles away somehow the motion of the earth how does the sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence and that is a task to which einstein set himself to figure out how gravity works and let me show you what it is that he found so einstein found that the medium that transmits gravity is space itself the idea goes like this a virtually unknown german mathematician named theodor kaluza of space to warp to curve and that communicates the force of gravity even the earth warps space around it now look at the moon the moon is kept in orbit according to these ideas because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment that the sun and the moon and the earth can all create by virtue of their presence we go to a full frame view of this the earth itself is kept in orbit because it rolls along a valley in the environment that's curved because of the sun 's presence that is this new idea about how actually works now one theory that might be able to describe all of nature 's forces from one set of ideas one set of principles one master equation if you will so kaluza said to himself einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of warps and curves in space in fact space and time to be more precise maybe i can play the same game with the other known force which a very bold and in some ways a very bizarre idea he proposed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions was at that time known as the electromagnetic force we know of others today but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about you know the force responsible for electricity and magnetic attraction and so forth so kaluza says maybe i can play the same game and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves that raised a question warps and curves in what so kaluza said well maybe there are more dimensions of space he said if i want to describe one more force maybe i need one more dimension so he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space not three and imagined that electromagnetism was warps and curves in that fourth dimension now here 's the thing when he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves in a universe with four space dimensions not three he found the old equations that einstein had already derived in three dimensions those were for gravity but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension and when he looked at that equation it was none other than the equation that scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force amazing it just popped out he was so excited by this realization that he ran around his house screaming victory that he had found kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously he in fact there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim that we are all aware of that is in addition to left right back forth and up down kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason he read a book a treatise on swimming then dove into the ocean this is a man who would risk his life on theory now but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded two questions immediately arise from his observation number one if there are more dimensions in space where are they seem to see them and number two does this theory really work in detail when you try to apply it to the world around us now the first question there might be big easy to see dimensions but there might also be tiny curled up dimensions curled up so small even though they're all around us that we don't see them let me show you that one visually but you and i all know that it does have some thickness it's very hard to see it though from far away but if we zoom in and take the perspective of say a little ant walking around little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions the long dimension but also this clockwise counter clockwise direction and i hope you appreciate this it took so long to get these ants to do this but this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts big and small and the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can easily see but there might be additional dimensions curled up sort of like the circular part of that cable so small that they have so far remained invisible let me show you what that would look like so if we take a look say at space itself i can only show of course two dimensions on a screen some of you guys will fix that one day but anything that's not flat on a screen is a new dimension goes smaller smaller smaller and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself this is the idea you could have additional curled up dimensions here is a little shape of a circle so small that we don't see them but if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around you could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about that's like the grid part but you could also access the tiny curled up so small that we can't see it with the naked eye or even with any of our most refined equipment but deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself the idea is there could be more dimensions as we see there now that's an explanation about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see but what about the second question that i asked does the theory actually work when you try to apply it to the real world well it turns out that einstein and kaluza and many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as was understood at the time detail it didn't work in detail for instance they couldn't get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory so many people worked on it but by the by the fifties this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away until something wonderful happened in our age in our era a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself many others around the world it's called superstring theory as you were indicating around us this particular idea however although we don't yet know whether it's right or wrong and at the end i'll discuss experiments which in the next few years may tell us whether it's right or wrong and the wonderful thing is that superstring theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions theory that tries to answer the question what are the basic fundamental indivisible uncuttable constituents making up everything in the world around us the idea is like this so imagine we look at a familiar object just a we also all know that atoms are not the end of the story they have little even the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as quarks that is where conventional ideas stop here is the new idea of string theory deep inside any of these particles there is something else this something else is this dancing filament of energy it looks like a vibrating string that's where the idea string theory comes from and just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello can vibrate in different patterns these can also vibrate in different patterns they don't produce different musical notes rather they produce the different particles making up the world around us these ideas are correct this is what the ultra microscopic landscape of the universe looks like it's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments vibrating energy vibrating in different frequencies the different frequencies produce the different particles the different particles this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century and continues to inform a lot of cutting edge research so i'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions are responsible for all the richness in the world around us and there you see unification because matter particles electrons and quarks put together under the rubric of vibrating strings and that's what we mean by a unified theory now here is the catch when you study the mathematics of string theory you find that it doesn't work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space it doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space nor five nor six finally you can study the equations and show that it works only in a universe that has ten dimensions of space and one dimension of time us right back to this idea of kaluza and klein that our world when appropriately described has more dimensions than the ones that we see now you might think about that and say well ok you know if you have extra dimensions and they're really tightly curled up that is true one of the other predictions of string theory no that's not one of the other predictions of string theory but it raises the question are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions or do they tell us something about the world in the remaining time i'd like to tell you two features of them first is many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question in theoretical physics theoretical science and that question is this when we look around the world as scientists have done for the last hundred years there appear to be about twenty numbers that really describe our universe these are numbers like the mass of the particles like electrons and quarks the strength of gravity the strength of the electromagnetic force a list of about twenty numbers that have been measured with incredible precision but nobody has an explanation for why the numbers have the particular values that they do if those numbers had any other values than the known ones the universe as we know it wouldn't exist this is a deep question why are those numbers so finely tuned to allow stars to shine and planets to form when we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers if i had twenty dials up here and i let you come up and fiddle with those numbers almost any fiddling makes the universe disappear so can we explain those twenty numbers and string theory suggests that those twenty numbers have to do with the extra dimensions let me show you how so when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory it's not one extra dimension as in the older ideas of kaluza and klein this is what string theory says about the extra dimensions they have a very rich intertwined geometry this is an example of something known as a calabi yau shape name isn't all that important but as you can see the extra dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape interesting structure and the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales when you swing your hand you'd be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again but they're so small that we wouldn't know it so what is the physical implication though relevant to those twenty numbers consider this if you look at the instrument a french horn notice that the vibrations of the airstreams are affected by the shape of the instrument now in string theory all the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate so just as those airstreams are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument strings themselves will be affected by the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving so let me bring some strings into the story and if you watch these little fellows vibrating around they'll be there in a second right there notice that they way they vibrate is affected by the geometry of the extra dimensions so if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like we don't yet but if we did we should be able to calculate the allowed notes the allowed vibrational patterns and if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns we should be able to calculate those twenty numbers and if the answer that we get from our calculations agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determined through detailed and precise experimentation this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is the way it now the second issue that i want to finish up with how might we test for these extra dimensions more directly is this just an interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some previously unexplained features of the world or can we actually test for these extra dimensions and we think and this is i think very exciting that in the next five years or so we may be able to test for the existence of these extra dimensions here 's how it goes and in that moment there are many people around who thought that that project had already been resolved newton had given the world,1
74,BrianSkerry_2010Z.sph.wav,the icy twenty nine degree water but as i got more involved in the story i realized that there were two big environmental issues i couldn't ignore the first was that these animals continue to be hunted killed with hakapiks at about eight fifteen days old it actually is the largest marine mammal slaughter on the planet with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year and even though we see a lot of ice in this picture there's a lot of water as well which wasn't there historically and the ice that is there is quite the problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice in order to nurse from their moms they only need twelve days from the moment they're born until their on their own but if they don't get twelve days they can fall into the ocean and die a photo that i made showing one of these pups that's only about five or seven days old still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly that has fallen in because of the thin ice and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe and to get it back to stable purchase i would like to share with you this morning some stories about the ocean through my work as a still photographer for national geographic magazine this problem has continued to grow each year since i was there i read that last year the pup mortality rate was one hundred percent in parts of the gulf of st lawrence so clearly this species has a lot of problems going forward this ended up becoming a cover story at national geographic and it received quite a bit of attention and with that i saw the potential to begin doing other stories about ocean problems so i proposed a story on the global fish crisis in part because i had personally witnessed a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last thirty years but also because i read a scientific paper stated ninety percent of the big fish in the ocean have disappeared in the last fifty or sixty years these are the tuna the billfish and the sharks and when i read that i was blown away by those numbers i thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet but it really wasn 't so i wanted to do a story that was a very different kind of the first component of the story that i thought was essential however was to give readers a sense of appreciation for the ocean animals that they were eating i think people go into a restaurant and somebody orders a steak and we all know where steak comes from and somebody orders a chicken and we know what a chicken is in reality these animals have no terrestrial counterpart they're unique in the world these are animals that can practically swim from the equator to the poles and can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a year if we weren't so efficient at catching them because they grow their entire life would have thirty year old bluefin out there that weigh a ton but the truth is we're way too efficient at catching them i guess i became an underwater photographer and a photojournalist because i fell in love with the sea as a child and i wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things i was seeing underwater just warehouse after warehouse and as i wandered around and made these pictures it sort of occurred to me that the ocean 's not a grocery store you know we can't keep taking without expecting serious consequences as a result i also with the story wanted to show readers how fish are caught some of the methods that are used to catch fish like a bottom trawler which is one of the most common methods in the world this was a small net that was being used in mexico to catch shrimp but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world you have a large net in the middle with two steal doors on either end and as this assembly is towed through the water the doors meet resistance with the ocean and it opens the mouth of the net and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom and this just drags over the bottom in this case to catch shrimp but as you can imagine it's catching everything else in its path as well and it's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom things like sponges and corals that critical habitat for other animals so this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner maybe seven or eight shrimp and ten lbs of other animals that had to die in the process and to make that point even more visual i swam under the shrimp boat and made the this picture of the guy shoveling this bycatch into the sea as trash and photographed this cascade of death you know animals like guitarfish bat rays flounder pufferfish that only an hour before were on the bottom of the ocean alive but now being thrown back as trash i also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry because currently on planet earth we're killing over one hundred million sharks every single year but before i went out to photograph this component i sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers you know i think there's still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark but this one morning i jumped in and found this thresher that had just recently died in the gill net and with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible it struck me as sort of a crucifixion if you will because i love sharks i'm somewhat obsessed with sharks i wanted to do another more celebratory story about sharks as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation so i went to the bahamas because there's very few places in the world where sharks are doing well these days but the bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy largely due to the fact that the government there had outlawed longlining several years ago and i wanted to show several species that we hadn't shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations one of the locations was this place called tiger beach in the northern bahamas where tiger sharks aggregate in shallow water this is a low altitude photograph that i made showing our diving boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks sort of just swimming around behind but the one thing i definitely didn't want to do with this coverage was to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters i didn't want them to be overly threatening or scary and with this photograph of a beautiful fifteen ft probably fourteen ft i guess female tiger shark i sort of think got to that goal where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose and my strobe created a shadow on her face and i think it's a gentler picture a little less threatening a little more respectful of the species creature but this an animal that's considered data deficient by science in both florida and in the bahamas you know we know almost nothing about them we don't know where they migrate to or from where they mate where they have their pups but more and more frequently these days i'm seeing terrible things underwater as well things that i don't think most people realize and yet hammerhead populations in the atlantic have declined about eighty percent in the last twenty to thirty years you know we're losing them faster than we can possibly find them this is the oceanic whitetip shark an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species if you pay attention to such lists but it's an animal that's about ninety eight percent in decline throughout most of its range because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water and because we weren't working on the bottom i brought along shark cage here and my friend shark biologist wes pratt is inside the cage you'll see that the photographer of course was not inside the cage here so clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer i guess and lastly with this story i also wanted to focus on baby sharks nurseries and i went to the island of bimini in the bahamas to work with lemon shark pups this is a photo of a lemon shark pup and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives in these protective mangroves and i've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues to tell a more complete story i want people to see what's happening underwater both the horror and the magic on the rest of the reef after i left bimini i actually learned that this habitat was being bulldozed to create a new golf course and resort and other recent stories have looked at single flagship species if you will that are at risk in the ocean as a way of talking about other threats one such story i did documented the leatherback sea turtle this is the largest widest ranging deepest diving and oldest of all turtle species here we see a female crawling out of the ocean under moonlight on the island of trinidad these are animals whose lineage dates back about one hundred million years and there was a time in their lifespan where they were coming out of the water to nest and saw tyrannosaurus rex running by and today they crawl out and see condominiums but despite this amazing longevity they're now considered critically endangered in the pacific where i made this photograph their stocks have declined about ninety percent in the last fifteen years this is a photograph that shows a hatchling about to taste saltwater for the very first time beginning this long and perilous journey only one in a thousand the first story that i did for national geographic where i recognized the ability to include environmental issues within a natural history coverage was a story i proposed on harp seals another charismatic megafauna species that i worked with is the story i did on the right whale and essentially the story is this with right whales that about a million years ago there was one species of right whale on the planet but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated the species sort of separated and today we have essentially two distinct stocks we have the southern right whale that we see here the north atlantic right whale that we see here with a mom and calf off the coast of florida now both species were hunted to the brink of extinction by the early whalers but the southern right whales have rebounded a lot better because they're located in places farther away from human activity the north atlantic right whale is listed as the most endangered species on the planet today because they are urban whales they live along the east coast of north america united states and canada and they have to deal with these urban ills this photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of florida you can see the coal burning plant in the background they have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals that are flushed out into the ocean and may be even affecting their reproduction they also get entangled in fishing gear this is picture that shows the tail of a right whale and those white markings are not natural markings these are entanglement scars the other problem is they get hit by ships and this was an animal that was struck by a ship in nova scotia canada being towed in where they did a necropsy to now the story i wanted to do initially was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year where these animals migrate down from the canadian arctic sub antarctic of of new zealand a place called the auckland islands i went down there in the winter time and these are animals that had never seen humans before and one of these amazingly beautiful forty five ft seventy ton whales like a city bus just swimming up you know they were in perfect condition very fat and healthy robust no entanglement scars the way they're suppose to i settled on working in the country of new zealand because new zealand was rather progressive and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean and i really wanted this story to be about three things i wanted it to be about abundance about diversity and about resilience and one of the first places i worked was to the gulf of st lawrence in canada to engage in courtship mating and to have their pups and all of this is played out against the backdrop of transient pack ice that moves with wind and tide these fish predate on sea urchins and when the fish were all gone all anyone ever saw underwater was just acres and acres of sea urchins but when the fish came back and began predating and controlling the urchin population low and behold kelp forests emerged in shallow water and that's because the urchins eat kelp so when the fish control the urchin population the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium you know this is probably how the ocean looked here one or two hundred years ago but nobody was around to tell us i worked in other parts of new zealand as well in beautiful fragile protected areas like in fiordland where this sea pen colony was found little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color in the northern part of new zealand i dove in the blue water where the water 's a little warmer and photographed animals like this giant sting ray swimming through an underwater canyon every part of the ecosystem in this place seems very healthy from tiny little animals like a nudibrank crawling over encrusting or a leatherjacket that is a very important animal in this ecosystem because it grazes on the bottom and allows new life to take i wanted to finish with this photograph a picture i made on a very stormy day in new zealand when i just laid on the bottom amidst a school of fish swirling around me and i was in a place that had only been protected about twenty years ago and i talked to divers that had been diving there for many years and they said that the marine life was better here today than it was in the nineteen sixties and that's because it's been protected that it has come back i became an underwater photographer because i fell in love with the sea and i make pictures of it today because i want to protect it and i don't think it's too late thank you very much,1
75,BruceBuenodeMesquita_2009.sph.wav,what they will do and if you engineer what they do you can change the world you can get a better result i would like to leave you with one thought i don't predict stock markets ok it's not going up any time really soon but i'm not engaged in doing that which is for me the dominant theme of this gathering and is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world when people say to you with i don't know how to do it thank you i got very nervous halfway through the talk though just panicking whether you'd included in your model the possibility that putting this prediction out there might change the result we've got eight hundred people in thought about that since i've done a lot of work for the intelligence community they've also pondered that it would be a good thing if people paid more attention took seriously and engaged in the same sorts of calculations because it would change things but it would change things in two beneficial ways it would hasten how quickly people arrive at an agreement and so it would save everybody a lot of grief and time i'm not engaged in predicting random number generators i actually get to say people of iran this is your destiny lets go there well people of iran this is what many of you are going to evolve to want and we could get there a lot sooner and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end and the world would be a better place here 's hoping they phone calls from people who want to know what lottery numbers are going to win i don't have a clue i engage in the use of game theory game theory is a branch of mathematics and that means sorry that even in the study of politics math has come the picture we can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics we need to look at this in a rigorous way now what is game theory about it assumes that people are looking out for what's good for them that doesn't seem terribly shocking although it's controversial for a lot of people that we are self interested in order to look out for what's best for them or what they think is best for them and they face limitations constraints they may be weak they may be located in the wrong part of the world they may be einstein away farming someplace in a rural village in india not being noticed as was the case for ramanujan for a long time a great mathematician but nobody noticed i'm going to try to do is explain to you quickly how to predict and illustrate it with some predictions about what iran is going to do in the next couple of years who is rational a lot of people are worried about what is rationality about people are rational mother theresa she was rational i think there are only two exceptions that i'm aware of two year olds they are not rational they have very fickle preferences they switch what they think all the time and schizophrenics are probably not rational but pretty much everybody else is rational that is they are just trying to do what they think is in their own best now in order to work out what people are going to do to pursue their interests we have to think about who has influence in the world if you're trying to influence corporations to change their behavior with regard to producing pollutants you would like it to have but if you show them that it's in their interest then they're responsive so we have to work out who influences problems if we're looking at iran the president of the united states we would like to think may have some influence certainly the president in iran has some influence doesn't know much about iran or about energy policy or about health care or about any particular policy that person surrounds himself or herself with advisers if we're talking about national security it's the secretary of state maybe it's the secretary of defense the director of national intelligence maybe the ambassador to the united nations or somebody else who they think is going to know more about the in order to predict effectively we need to use science and the reason that we need to use science is because then we can reproduce what we're doing it's not just wisdom or guesswork problem but lets face it the secretary of state doesn't know much about iran the secretary of defense doesn't know much about iran each of those people in turn has advisers who advise them so they can advise the president there are lots of people shaping decisions and so if we want to predict correctly we have to pay attention to everybody who is trying to shape the outcome not just the people at the pinnacle of the decision making pyramid a lot of times we don't do that there's a good reason that we don't do that and there's a good reason that using game theory and computers we can overcome the limitation of just looking at a few people imagine a problem with just five decision makers imagine for example that sally over here wants to know what harry and jane and george and frank thinking and sends messages to those people sally 's giving her opinion to them and they're giving their opinion to sally but sally also wants to know what harry is saying to these three and what they're saying to harry and harry wants to know what each of those people are saying to each other and so on and sally would like to know what harry thinks those people are saying that's a complicated problem that's a lot to know with five decision makers there are a lot of linkages one hundred and twenty as a matter of fact if you remember your factorials five factorial is one hundred and twenty that mean we've doubled the number of pieces of information we need to know from one hundred and twenty to two hundred and forty no how about ten times but computers they can they don't need coffee breaks they don't need vacations they don't need to go to sleep at night and if we can predict then we can engineer the future so if you are concerned to influence energy policy or you are concerned to influence national security policy why should we believe what he 's saying so i'm going to show you a factoid this is an assessment by the central intelligence agency of the percentage of time that the model i'm talking about is right in predicting things whose outcome is not yet known when the experts who provided the data inputs got it wrong that's not my claim that's a cia claim you can read it it was declassified a while ago you can read it in a volume edited by h bradford westerfield yale university press so what do we need to know in order to predict we do need to know who has a stake in trying to shape the outcome of a decision we need to know what they say they want that is how willing are they to drop what they're doing when the issue comes up and attend to it instead of something else that's on their plate how big a deal is it to them and how much clout could they bring to bear if they chose to on the issue if we know those things we can predict their behavior by assuming that everybody cares about two things on any decision they care about the outcome they'd like an outcome as close to what they are interested in as possible they're careerists they also care about getting credit there's ego involvement they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome or as important if it's their druthers to block an outcome and so we have to figure out how they balance those two things different people trade off going down in a blaze of glory or giving it up putting their finger in the wind and doing whatever they think is going to be a winning position most people fall in between and if we can work out where they fall we can work out how to negotiate with them or health policy or education science and a particular branch of science is a way to do it not the way we've been doing it which is seat of the pants wisdom to change their behavior so with just that little bit of input we can work out what the choices are that people have what the chances are that they're willing to take what they're after what they value what they want and what they believe about other people you might notice what we don't need to know no history in here how they got to where they are may be important in shaping the input information but once we know where they are we're worried about where they're going to be headed in the future how they got there turns out not to be terribly critical in predicting i remind you of that ninety percent accuracy rate so where are we going to get this information we can get this information from the internet from the economist the financial times the new york times u s news and world report lots of sources like that or we can get it from asking experts who spend their lives studying places and problems because those experts know this information if they don't know who are the people trying to influence the decision how much clout do they have how much they care about this issue and what do they say they want are they experts that's what it means to be an expert that's the basic stuff an expert needs to know turn to iran let me make three important predictions you can check this out iran going to do about its nuclear weapons program how secure is the theocratic regime in iran what's its future and everybody 's best friend now before i get into how to do it let me give you a little truth in advertising because i'm not engaged in the business of magic things going for him how are things going to be working out for him in the next year or two you take a look at this this is not based on statistics i want to be very clear here i'm not projecting some the dynamics of interaction and these are the simulated dynamics the predictions about the path of policy so you can see here on the vertical axis i haven't shown it all the way down to zero there are lots of other options but here i'm just showing you it would achieve some national pride but not go ahead and build a weapon and down at one hundred they would build civilian nuclear energy which is what they say is their objective the yellow line shows us the most likely path the yellow line includes an analysis of eighty seven decision makers in iran and a vast number of outside influencers trying to pressure iran there are lots of thing that the approach i take can predict and there are some that it can 't it can predict changing its behavior various players in the united states and egypt and saudi arabia and russia european union japan so on and so forth the white line reproduces the analysis if the international environment just left iran to make its own internal decisions under its own domestic political pressures that's not going to be happening but you can see the line comes down faster if they're not put under international pressure if they're allowed to pursue their own devices but in any event by the end of this year beginning of next year we get to a stable equilibrium outcome and that equilibrium is not what the united states would like but it's probably an equilibrium that the united states can live with and that a lot of others can live with and that is that iran will achieve that nationalist pride making enough weapons grade fuel through research so that they could show that they know how to make weapons grade fuel but not enough to actually build a bomb how is this happening over here you can see this is the distribution of power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today this is what that power block is predicted to be like by the late parts of two thousand and ten early parts of two thousand and eleven out here today there are a bunch of people ahmadinejad for example who would like not only to build a bomb but test a bomb that power disappears completely nobody supports that by two thousand and eleven these guys are all shrinking the power is all drifting over here so the outcome is going to be the weapons grade fuel who are the winners and who are the losers in iran take a look at these guys they're growing in power and by the way this was done a while ago before the current economic crisis and that's probably going to get steeper these are the moneyed interests in iran the bankers the oil people the bazaaries they are growing in political clout as the are isolating themselves with the exception of one group of mullahs who are not well known to americans that's this line here growing in power much of what has to do with business but sorry if you're looking to speculate in the stock market these are what the iranians call the quietists these are the ayatollahs mostly based in qom who have great clout in the religious community have been quiet on politics and are going to be getting louder because they see iran going in an unhealthy direction a direction contrary to what khomeini had in mind player in iran he is on the way down ok so i'd like you to take a little away from this everything is not predictable the stock market is at least for me not predictable but most complicated negotiations are predictable again whether we're health policy education environment energy litigation mergers all of these are complicated problems that are predictable that this sort of technology can be applied to the reason that being able to predict those things is important is not just because you might run a hedge fund and make money off of it but because if you can predict what people will do you,1
76,BruceFeiler_2010P.sph.wav,and every seven sets of seven years the land gets an extra year of rest during which time all families are reunited and people surrounded with the ones they love year is called the jubilee year and it's the origin of that term and though i'm shy of fifty it captures my own experience my lost year was my jubilee year by laying fallow i planted the seeds for a healthier future and was reunited with the ones i love the one year anniversary of my journey i went to see my surgeon doctor john healey and by the way healey great name for a doctor he 's the president of the international society of limb salvage which is the least euphemistic term i've ever heard and i said doctor healey if my daughters come to you one day and say what should i i would tell them what i know and that is everybody dies but not everybody lives as i looked at this list to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living i realized we may have done it for our girls but it really changed us and that is the secret of the council of dads is that my wife and i did this in an attempt to help our daughters but it really changed us so i stand here today as you see now walking without crutches or and last week i had my eighteen month scans wrote a series of books about my travels including walking the bible i hosted a television show by that name on pbs i was for all the world the walking guy say can never find a solution for scan xiety as i was going there i was wondering what would i say depending on what happened here heard about our story and very quickly in a span of three weeks put the full resources of twenty three andme and we announced an initiative in july to get to decode the genome of anybody a living person with a heart tissue bone sarcoma and she told me last night in the three months since we've done it we've gotten three hundred people who 've contributed to this program and the epidemiologists here will tell you that's half the number of people who get the disease in one year in the united states so if you go to twenty three andme or if you go to councilofdads com you can click on a link and we encourage anybody been talking about by leaving you with this message and take a long slow walk until in may two thousand and eight a routine visit to my doctor and a routine blood test produced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number that something might be wrong with my bones and my doctor on a whim sent me to get a full body bone scan which showed that there was some growth in my left leg that sent me to an x ray then to an mri and one afternoon i got a call from my doctor the tumor in your leg is not consistent with a benign tumor i stopped walking and it took my mind a second to convert that in the same place in my body as the accident thirty eight years earlier it seemed like too much of a coincidence i was four years old and my family moved to a new neighborhood in our hometown of savannah georgia and this was the nineteen sixties when actually all the streets in this neighborhood were named after confederate war generals so that afternoon i went back to my house and my three year old identical twin daughters eden and tybee feiler came running to meet me they'd just turned three and they were into all things pink and purple in fact we called them pinkalicious and purplicious although i must say our favorite nickname occurred on their birthday april fifteenth when they were born at six fourteen and six forty six on april fifteen aisles i might not walk down they wonder who i was i thought would they yearn for my approval my love my voice few days later i woke with an idea of how i might give them that voice i would reach out to six men from all parts of my life and ask them to be present in the passages of my daughters lives i believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives i wrote these men they 'll have loving families and welcoming homes but they may not have me they may not have their dad will you help be their dad in this culture i don't have to tell you that you sort of happy your way through a problem we should focus on the positive my wife as i said she grew up outside of boston she's got a big smile she's got a big personality she's got big hair we lived on robert e lee blvd and when i was five my parents gave me an orange schwinn stingray bicycle although she told me recently i can't say she has big hair because if i say she has big hair people will think she's from texas and it's apparently okay to marry a boy from georgia but not to have hair from texas i said look in georgia at least we want to know in arkansas they don't even ask what i didn't tell her is if she said yes you could jump you don't need the thirty day waiting period because you don't need the get to know you session at that point so i wasn't going to tell her about this idea but the next day i couldn't control myself i told her and she loved the idea but she quickly started rejecting my nominees well i love him but i would never ask him for advice so it turned out that starting a council of dads was a very efficient way to find out what my wife really thought of my friends so we decided that we needed a set of rules and we came up with a number and the first one was no family only friends we thought our family would already be there second men only we were trying to fill the dad space in the girls lives and then third sort of a dad for every side we kind of went through my personality and tried to get a dad who represented each different thing it had a swooping banana seat and those ape hanger handlebars that made the rider look like an so what happened was i wrote a letter to each of these men and rather than send it i decided to read it to them in person linda my wife joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals i sort of friend married each of these guys we were in this youth hostel in a castle and i snuck out behind and there was a moat a fence and a field of cows and jeff came up beside me and said so have you ever been cow tipping so before i had a chance to determine whether this was right or not we had jumped the moat we climbed the fence we were tiptoeing through the dung and approaching some poor dozing cow so a few weeks after my diagnosis we went up and then i asked him a question which i ended up asking to all the dads and ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book and that was what 's the one piece of advice you would give to my girls and jeff 's advice was be a traveller not a tourist get off the bus seek out what's different approach the cow so it's ten years from now i said and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad and i'm not here what would you tell them as he talked he had that glint in his eye that i first saw back in holland the glint that says let 's go cow tipping even though we never did tip the cow even though no one tips the cow even though cows don't sleep standing up he said i want to see you back here girls at the end of this experience covered in two weeks after my diagnosis a biopsy confirmed i had a seven inch osteosarcoma in my left femur six hundred americans a year get an osteosarcoma eighty five percent are under twenty one twenty years ago doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped and there was a fifteen percent survival rate room i went through four and a half months of chemo actually i had cisplatin doxorubicin and very high dose methotrexate and then i had a fifteen hour surgery in which my surgeon doctor john healey at memorial sloan kettering hospital in new york took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium and if you did see the sanjay special you saw these enormous screws that they screwed into my pelvis then he took my fibula from my calf cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh where it now lives and what he actually did was he de vascularized it this is a surgery so rare only two human beings have survived and my reward for surviving it was to go back for four more months of chemo it was as we said in my house a lost year and i remember a particular one night that when you told that story of i don't know where you are doctor nuland of william sloane coffin it made me think of it i was in the hospital after i think it was my fourth round of chemo when my numbers went to zero and i had basically no immune system and they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital and anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body and one night i got a call from my mother in law that my daughters at that time three and a half i was hit by a passing sedan absence and i hung up the phone and i put my face in my hands and i screamed this silent scream and what you said doctor nuland i don't know where you are made me think of this today because the thought that came to my mind was that feeling that i had was like a primal scream and what was so striking and one of the messages i want to leave you here with today is the experience as i became less and less human my mangled body flew in one direction my mangled bike flew in the other at that moment i was less and less human i was also at the same time maybe the most human i've ever been and what was so striking about that time was instead of repulsing people i was actually proving to be a magnet for people people were incredibly drawn my wife and i had kids we thought it would be all hands on deck instead it was everybody running the other way and when i had cancer we thought it 'd be everybody running the other way instead it was all hands on deck and when people came to me rather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw i was like a living ghost they were incredibly moved to talk about what was going on in their own lives it is an invitation maybe even a mandate to enter the most vital arenas of human life the most sensitive and the most frightening the ones that we never want to go to but when we do go there we feel incredibly transformed when we do and this also happened to my girls as they began to see and we thought maybe became an ounce more compassionate one of the profound things that happened was this act of actually connecting to all these people and it made me think and i'll just note for the record one word that i've only heard once actually was when we were all doing tony robbins yoga yesterday the one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually is the word friend bruce i said and promptly passed out and no one captures this modern manhood to me more than david black now david is my literary agent he 's about five foot three and a half on a good day standing fully upright in cowboy boots and on kind of the manly male front he answers the phone i can say this i guess because you've done it here he answers the phone yo motherfucker he gives boring speeches about obscure bottles of wine and on his fiftieth birthday he bought a convertible sports car although like a lot of men he 's impatient he bought it on his forty i broke my left femur that day it's the largest bone in your body and spent the next two months in a body cast that went from my chin to the tip of my toe to my right knee and a steel bar went from my right knee to my left ankle but like a lot of modern men he hugs he bakes he leaves work early to coach little league someone asked me if he cried when i asked him to be in the council of dads i was like david cries when you invite him to take a walk he said i don't see the wall and i'm telling you the same don't see the wall you may encounter one from time to time but you've got to find a way to get over it around it or through it but whatever you do don't succumb to it don't give in to the wall my home is not far from the brooklyn bridge and during the year and a half i was on crutches it became a sort of symbol to me so one day near the end of my journey i said come on girls let 's take a walk across the brooklyn bridge we set out on crutches i was on crutches my wife was next to me my girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead because walking was one of the first things i lost i spent most of that year thinking about this most elemental of human acts as my physical therapist likes to say every step is a tragedy waiting to happen you nearly fall with one leg then you catch yourself with the other and the biggest consequence of walking on crutches as i did for a year and a half is that you walk slower you hurry you get where you're going but you get there alone you go slow you get where you're going but you get there with this community you built along the way at the risk of admission i was never nicer than the year i was on crutches two hundred years ago a new type of pedestrian appeared in paris he was called a flaneur one who wanders the arcades and it was the custom of those flaneurs to show they were men of leisure by taking turtles for walks and letting the reptile set the pace and i just love this ode to slow moving and it's become my own motto for my girls take a walk with a turtle behold the world in,1
77,BruceMcCall_2008P.sph.wav,i work a lot in what i call retrofuturism which is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow and they're always wrong always hilariously optimistically wrong and the peak time for that was the thirties because the depression was so dismal that anything to get away from the present into the future and technology was going to carry us along this is popular workbench popular science magazines in those days i had a huge collection of them from the thirties all they are just poor people being asked to make sunglasses out of wire coat hangers and everything improvised and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots playing ice hockey at three hundred miles an hour it a s all going to happen it a s all going to be wonderful automotive retrofuturism is one of my specialties i was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter so i have a lot of revenge to take on the subject i don't know what the hell i'm doing here my teeth techno archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened for good reason usually the zeppelin this was from a brochure about based obviously on the hindenburg but the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man and it carried fifty six people at the speed of a buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark and it cost twice as much as a first class cabin on the normandie to fly it so the was inevitable it was going to go this is auto gyro jousting in malibu in the thirties the auto gyro couldn't wait for the invention of the helicopter but it should have it wasn't a big success it's the only spanish innovation technologically of the twentieth century by the way needed to know that most useless human emotion so i think that a s a case for serious play this is emblematic of it this is wing dining and i paint on paper using gouache which hasn't changed in six hundred years reading some pages from his new novel to fitzgerald and ford madox ford until the slipstream blows him away this is tank polo in this is the brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody i do a lot of that they had two machine guns and a cannon and they had ninety horsepower ricardo engines they went five miles an hour and inside it was one hundred and five degrees in the pitch dark and they had a canary hung inside the thing to happy little story isn't it this is motor ritz towers in manhattan in the thirties where you drove up to your front door if you had the but about three years ago i had an art show in new york and i titled it serious nonsense so i think i'm actually the first one here fond memory of times past hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit just for the fun of it this was a piece i did a brochure again and it's so safe it carries no insurance but it's not a cri de coeur about man 's hubris in the face of the elements it's just a sick silly joke shamelessly cheap is something i think this will wake you up it has no meaning just desoto discovers the mississippi and that's a desoto discovering the mississippi i did that as a i lead i called it serious nonsense because on the serious side i use a technique of painstaking realism thirty of them are based on that concept i was driving down seventh avenue one night at three a m and this steam pouring out of the street and i thought what causes that and who a s to say the temple of dendur at the metropolitan in new york it's a very somber place i thought i could jazz it up a bit have a little fun with it this is a very un pc cover not in new york i couldn't resist and i got a nasty email from some environmental group saying this is too serious and solemn to make fun of you should be ashamed please apologize on our website haven't got around to it yet i this is the word side of my love the word if you live in new york you know how the bike messengers move except that he 's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff they all do of editorial illustration from when i was a kid i copied it and i never unlearned it it's the only style i know and it's very kind of staid and formal i don't know a hell of a lot about fashion i was told to do what they call a mary jane and then i got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying put a strap on it no don't put a strap on it put a strap on it one letter makes an idea this is a big joke this is the audition for king kong you know that name called me and said she loved the cover it was so sweet her former name was fay wray and so that was i didn't have the wit to say take the painting you can't see it all together unfortunately but if you look at it enough you can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move and meanwhile i use nonsense as you can see this is a scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors and the trick was to bang the golf ball off a suits of armor which you can't see there this was one of a series called zany afternoons which became a book this is a home built rocket propelled would just like to add a crass commercial i have a kids book coming out so thank you very much,1
78,BrunoBowden_2008.sph.wav,and so the two of us are here to give you an example of creation and i'm going to be folding one of robert lang 's models and this is the piece of paper it will be made from and you can see all of the folds that are needed for it and rufus is going to be doing some improvisation on his custom five string electric cello and it's very exciting to listen to him,1
79,BurtRutan_2006.sph.wav,whether we're first or not really doesn't matter the russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the concorde and then they flew a few cargo flights and took it out of service i think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered what we're looking forward to already there's about a billion and a half to a billion point seven investment in private space flight that is not government at all already worldwide read if you google it you'll find about half of that money but there's twice of that being committed out there not spent yet but being committed and planned for the next few years what we're looking forward to i'm predicting though as profitable as this industry is going to be and it certainly is profitable when you fly people two hundred thousand dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost or less this is going to be very profitable i predict also that is not only the inspiration of our children but the current plan right now is and every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by factor of ten to fifteen and what that means is before we know the progress in human space flight with no taxpayer dollars will be at a level that is because us it's private industry you should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff and we've done it for a long time the naca before nasa never developed an airliner and never ran an airline but nasa is developing the space liner always has and runs the only space line ok and we've shied away from it because we're afraid of it but starting back in june of two thousand and four not really even when i showed that a little allowing the most creative people in this country the boeing 's and lockheed 's space engineers to go out and take risks and try new stuff we're going to go back to the moon fifty years later and we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new i'm really troubled by that but anyway that's the basis of the thing that i want to share with you today though is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later that's the theme of my next fifteen minutes here and i think that the inspiration begins when you're very young three year olds up to twelve fourteen year olds what we what they look at is the most important thing i want to start off by saying houston we have a problem take a snapshot at aviation and there was a wonderful little short four year time period airplanes were invented by natural selection now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes there probably at least thirty thousand different things tried and when they crash and kill the pilot don't try that again the ones that flew and landed ok because there was no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition so we by making a whole bunch of attempts entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space in fact thousands of attempts in that four year time period we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today and that's why they're so safe as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good that has not happened at all in space flying there's only been two concepts tried two by the u s and one by the russians well who was inspired during that time period aviation week asked me to make a list of who i thought were the movers and shakers of the first one hundred years of aviation and i wrote them down and i found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation well what happened when i was a little kid was some pretty heavy stuff the jet age started the missile age started von braun was on there showing how to go to mars and this was before sputnik and this was at a time when mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now we thought there'd be animals there we knew there were plants there the colors change right but you know nasa screwed that up because they've sent these robots and they've landed it only in the if you look at what happened this little black line is as fast as man ever flew and the red line is a top of the line military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport you notice here 's a big jump when i was a little kid we stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing and i think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try well what did i do when i was a kid i didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and well we didn't have drugs in those days but i did competition model airplanes i spent about seven years during the vietnam war flight testing airplanes for the air force and then i went in and i had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages and some three thousand of these are flying of course one of them is around the world voyager the most impressive airplane ever i believe was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet the most impressive spaceship ever i believe was a grumman lunar lander it was a you know it landed on the moon take off of the moon didn't need any maintenance guys that we as a species have always done and that is instinctively we've gone out and climbed over three years and we can't do that now crazy talk very briefly about innovation cycles things that grow have a lot of activity they die out when they're replaced by something else these things tend to happen every twenty five years forty years long with an overlap you can put that statement on all kinds of different technologies the interesting thing by the way the speed here excuse me higher speed travel is the title of these innovation cycles there is none here here 's the biggie and that is you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it you know a good example of course is the darpa net computers were used for artillery first then irs but when we got it now you have all the level of activity all the benefit from it private sector to do it keep that in mind i put down innovation i've looked for innovation cycles in space and i found the very first year starting when gagarin went in space and a few weeks later alan shepherd there were five manned space flights in the world the very first year in two thousand and three everyone that the united states sent to space was killed there were only three or four flights in two thousand and three in two thousand and four there were only two flights two russian soyuz flights to the international manned station and i had to fly three in mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people this is a picture here taken from spaceshipone this is a picture here taken from orbit our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that we know how to do it for sub orbital flying now do it safe enough at least as safe as the early airlines so that can be done and i think i want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small well first of all what's going to happen next the first industry will be a high volume a lot of players another one announced just last week and it will be sub orbital and the reason it has to be sub orbital is there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit and i feel very strongly that it's not good enough the governments have been doing this three governments have been doing this for forty five years and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died that's you don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety be very high volume we think one hundred thousand people will fly by two thousand and twenty i can't tell you when this will start because i don't want my competition to know my schedule but i think once it does we will find solutions and very quickly you'll see those resort hotels in orbit and that real easy thing to do which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view and that will be really cool because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by ten feet if you want oh it's going to be so much fun for us to have generations of kids that think that it's ok to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it they need to look forward to my critics say hey rutan 's just spending a lot of these billionaires money for joyrides for what's this this is not a transportation system it's just for fun because i could say i got a computer at my house and you don 't what do you use it for come over it does frogger not the banks computer or big development big improvement and capability and so on and they get out there in enough homes we were for a new invention and the inventor is in this audience al gore invented the internet and because of that something that we used for a whole year excuse me a whole decade for fun became everything our commerce our research our communication and if we let the google guys think for another couple weekends we can add a dozen more things to the list and it won 't be very long before you won 't be able to convince kids that we didn't always have computers in our a group of people that have come forward and you don't know all of them but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children this little three to fifteen year old age by us going to orbit and going to the moon here right in this time period paul allen richard branson jeff the ansari family which is now funding the russians sub orbital thing bob bigelow a private space station and these people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area and i think it's a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something but they're putting it in very areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore and i think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct they were inspired by big progress we need to inspire them because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future i'm particularly troubled that what nasa's doing right now with this new bush doctrine to but look at the progress that's going on after that there were a couple of examples here the military fighters had a highest performance military airplane was the sr seventy one it went a whole life cycle got too rusty to fly and was taken out of service the concorde doubled the speed for airline travel it went a whole life cycle without competition took out of service and we're stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late but something is out there to inspire our kids now and i'm talking about if you've got a baby now or if you've got a ten year old now what's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here relatively soon you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest performance military operational airplane it's never happened before the fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been well you know you win the war in twelve minutes why do you need something better but i think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub orbital flights to space very soon wait a minute what's happening here we'll have military fighters with sub orbital capability and i think very soon this but the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first ok i look forward to a new we didn't lose them technically the fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let von braun fly technology and that was a very strong thing and then we flew alan shepherd weeks after gagarin not months or decades or whatever so we had the capability but america lost for this next decade and a half oh shoot i screwed up we have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics well again what's interesting here is we've lost to the russians on the first couple of milestones already you cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in america you can buy it in russia it's commercial it can be defined as space tourism they are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon like apollo eight was done one hundred million bucks go to the moon but you know would you have thought back in the sixties when the space race was going on that the first commercial capitalist like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in russian hardware and would you have thought would the russians have thought that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware the guys inside won 't be russians maybe it'll probably be a japanese or an american billionaire well that's weird you know it really is but anyway i think we need to beat them again i think what we'll do is we'll see a successful very successful private space flight industry,1
80,CalebChung_2007P.sph.wav,little creatures that you can love now these are this now that's the mcnugget maker and this is a this is my oldest daughter making a mcapple pie and let 's see you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar and then you eat and you eat a feeling of caring and we have i have a little something here now i do want to say that you know ugobe is not there yet we've just opened the door and it's for all of you to step through it we did include some things that are hopefully useful me pleo they he has a usb and he has a sd card so it's completely open architecture so anyone can plug him thank you this is john over here anyone can take pleo and they can totally redo you can change his homeostatic drives or whatever you want to call them kids can just drag and drop put in new sounds we actually so it's he likes that so they're a handful we hope you get one missing to say but as a last thing i'd like to say is that if we continue along this path we are designing our about three hundred pounds now no she's not she's beautiful this is how they looked when they came out at the end these are a this is like a fifteen million dollar line and it through some a that paid the rent for about a month this is a walking barbie i said oh this is i'm using little phone connectors or was or kind of am a toy designer and before i was a toy designer oh i was a mime a street mime actually and then i made a lego animator i thought this would be so great and you know lego don't i started doing animatronics i loved dinosaurs i used to be in the film business kind of and actually nicholas negroponte saw this when i was like twelve and anyway so then they said no you have to make and so this is a i used to kind of be an actor and i'm not really very good at it but the this is a guy named doctor yutz who would take toys and show kids about engineering and you can see the massively parallel processing nintendos there and over to the left is a view master of the cd rom and a guy named stan reznikov did this as a pilot this is a you can see the little and then i was an entertainer i guess and before that i was a silversmith and before that i was i was out of the house at about fifteen and a half and i that was the first batch of products most of them did not go you get one out of twenty one out of thirty products and every now and then we do something like a you know an automated hair wrap machine you know that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out and and we'd make some money on that you know and we'd give it out but eventually we left la and we moved to idaho where there was actually a lot of peace and quiet and i started working on this project oh i have to tell you about this real quick you know you to find innovation and i tried to sum this up in some kind of symbol that means something to me anyway and so art and science have a kind of dynamic balance that's where i think innovation happens and actually this is to me how i can come up with great ideas but it's not how you actually get leverage actually you have to put a circle around that and call it business and those three together i think give you leverage in the world but moving on so this is a quick tale i'm going to tell this is the furby tale as he said i was co inventor of the furby i did the body and creature well you'll see so by way of showing you this you can kind of get an understanding of what it is to hopefully try to create robotic life forms or technology that has an emotional connection with the user so this is my family this is my wife christi and abby and melissa and my seventeen year old now emily who was just a pack of trouble all right there 's there's that robot again i came out of the movie business as i said and i said let 's make these animatronic robots let 's make these things and so i've always had a big interest in this this one actually didn't go anywhere but i got my feet wet doing this this is a smaller one and i have a little moving torso on there a little tiny guy walks along more servo drives lots of servo hacking lots of mechanical stuff so the challenge was i worked for microsoft for a little bit working on the microsoft barney and this is a you know the purple dinosaur with kind of bloat wear and you know fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form and that's our little thirty cent mabuchi motor and so i have all these design books like i'm sure many of you have and throughout the books this is the first page on furby i have kind of the art and science i have the really cool anyway i wanted over here and the how over there i try to do a lot of philosophy a lot of thinking about all of these projects because they're not just bing ideas you have to really dig deep to show you a little bit about the world of toy design at least from my small aperture of the world this is a this is a video i made when i first started that turned out to be a little more than true there's my first exploded view and all the little pieces and the little worm drive and all that stuff the little bb in the box is my tilt sensor i just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic so there's the back of his head with a billion holes in it and there i am i'm done there's my little furby no it's a little robot on heroin or something i think right now you see i love little robots so my wife says well you may like it but nobody else will so she comes to the rescue this is my wife christi who is just you know doing toy design i'm in my garage making weird stuff and then you go to these toy companies and there's some guy across the table and he goes pass pass pass you know you think it's so cool but they anyway i'd made this little tape that i always show when i go in this is the name of my so here 's a little pink one a little pouf on his head and here 's this didn't do so well in testing either i don't know why there's my favorite demon furby that was a good one and since then every time i come home from toys r us with dolls or something they disappear from my desk and they get hidden in the house i have three girls and they just they it's like a rescue animal thing they're going little tether coming off it's just a control for the fur 's mouth and his eyes it's just a little server control and i made a and that's how we sold him and hasbro actually said i meant tiger electronics at the time said yeah we want to do this we have you know ran the parts for that so this is how they come out close to the end and then they looked like little garfields there eight months later you may remember this this was a total total total chaos for a while they were making two million furbys a month they actually wound up doing about forty million furbys i it's unbelievable how i don't know how that can be and hasbro made about you know a billion and a half dollars so full circle why do i do this why do you you know try to do this stuff and it's of course for your kids and there's my youngest daughter with her furbys and she still actually has those so i kind of retired and we're already living in paradise up in boise on a river you know and then i started another company called toy innovation and we did some projects with mattel with a actually with a lady who 's here ivy ross and moves baby made it in wired magazine did a bunch of other stuff and then i started another company we did a little guy saw it and then people started to want to do it and they said they'd spend all this time so i said ok let 's try to do this dinosaur project the crazy idea is we're going to try to a dinosaur as much as we can with today 's technology and it's not really but as close as we can do and we're going to try to really so i used to work at mattel actually and after i left mattel i started pull this off intentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive not a robot that kind of does but let 's really go for it so i picked a camarasaurus because the camarasaurus was the most abundant of the sauropods in north america and you could actually find full fossil evidence of these that's a juvenile and so we actually went in there's a book very very obsessive there's a kind of truncated camarasaurus skeleton but the geometry 's correct and then i went in and measured all the geometry because i figured hey biomimicry if i do it kind of right it might move kind of like the real thing so there's the motor and about this time you know all these other people are starting to help here 's an example of what we did with the skull there's the skull all these hamburger makers and then got the license to make the maker so this is a hamburger maker that you take the peanut butter and stuff and you put it in there and it makes and this is a french fry maker little tiny there's some solid works versions of it here 's some sla parts of the same thing and then these are really crude pieces we were just doing some tests here there's the skull pretty much the same shape as the camarasaurus there's a photo realistic eye behind a lens and there's kind of the first exploded view or see through view there's the first sla version and it already kind of has the feel it has kind of a cuteness already and the thing about blending science and art in this multidisciplinary stuff is you can do a robot and then you go back and do the shape and then you go back and forth the servos in the front legs we had to shape those like muscles they had to fit within the a tremendous amount of work to get all that working right all the neck and the tail are cable so it moves smoothly and organically and then of course you're not done yet you have to get the look for the skin the skin 's a whole another thing probably the hardest part so you hire artists and you try to get the look and feel of the character now this is not with character designers right and we're still trying to keep with the real character so now you go back and you cover the whole thing with clay now you start doing the sculpture for this and you can see we got a guy from who 's just john sosoka is our cto and is really the man that's done most of the work with our like forty person company i'd like to give john a hand he never gets recognition this right it's very painful so these and you can probably see them this i on purpose they go through life stages so when you first get them they're babies and you more you have them kind of the older they get and they kind of learn through their behavior so this one this one 's actually asleep and so this guy 's listening to my voice here but they have forty sensors all over their body they have seven processors they have fourteen motors they have you don't care do you they're just cute right that's the idea that's the idea so you see hey come good wake up wake up wake up yeah they're like kids you know you yeah he 's hungry i'll show you what he 's been doing for for four years here here here have some money pleo that's what the investors think that right right so they're really sweet little guys and we're hoping that you know our belief is that humans need to feel empathy towards things in order to be more human and we think we can help that out by having,1
81,CameronHerold_2009X.sph.wav,and jim clark and jim barksdale have all got it and they built netscape imagine if they were given ritalin we wouldn't have have that stuff right al gore would have really invented the internet a video that was done by one of the companies that i mentor these guys grasshopper it's about kids it's about entrepreneurship hopefully this inspires you to take what you've heard from me and do something with it to change the world be an entrepreneur entrepreneurs are people because we have a lot of them in this room who have these ideas and these passions or see these needs in the world and decide to stand up and do it we have an obligation as parents and a society to start teaching our kids to fish instead of giving them the fish the old parable if you give a man a fish you feed him for a day if you teach a man to fish you feed him for a lifetime if we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial the ones that show those traits to be like we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science what if we saw the ones who had entrepreneurial traits and taught them to be entrepreneurs we could have all these kids spreading businesses instead of waiting for government handouts that i'm the dumbest guy in the room because i couldn't get through school i struggled with school but what i knew at a very early age was that i loved money and i loved business and i loved this entrepreneurial thing and i was raised to be an entrepreneur what we do is we sit and teach our kids all the things they shouldn 't do don't hit don't bite don't swear right now we teach our kids to go after really good jobs you know and the school system teaches them to go after things like being a doctor and being a lawyer and being an accountant and a dentist and a teacher and a pilot and the media says that it's really cool if we could go out and be a model or a singer or a sports hero like sidney crosby our mba programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs even in popular literature the only book i've ever found and this should be on all of your reading lists the only book i've ever found that makes the entrepreneur into the hero is atlas shrugged and we all decided to start these things because it's really the only place we fit we didn't fit in the normal work we couldn't work for somebody else because we're too stubborn and we have all these other traits kids could be entrepreneurs as well i'm a big part of a couple organizations globally called the entrepreneurs organization and the young presidents organization i just came back from speaking in barcelona at the ypo global conference and everyone that i met over there who 's an entrepreneur go on and on kids you can see these signs in kids and what we're doing is we're giving them ritalin and saying don 't be an entrepreneurial type fit into this other system and try to become a student and what i've been really passionate about ever since and i've never spoken about this ever until now so this is the first time anyone 's ever heard it except my wife three days ago because she said what are you talking about and i told aren't students we fast track we figure out the game i stole essays i cheated on exams i hired kids to do my accounting assignments in university for thirteen consecutive assignments but as an entrepreneur you don't do accounting you hire accountants so i just figured that out earlier at least i can admit i cheated in university most of you won 't i'm also quoted and i told the person who wrote the textbook i'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook in every canadian heard those things about is it nurture or is it nature right is it thing one or thing two what is it well i don't think it's either i think it can be both i was groomed as an entrepreneur when i was growing up as a young kid i had no choice because i was taught at a very early young age when my dad realized i wasn't going to fit in to everything else that was being taught to me in school that he could teach me to figure out business at an early age he groomed us the three of us to hate the thought of having a job and to love the fact of creating companies that we could employ other people my first little business venture i was seven years old i was in winnipeg and i was lying in my bedroom with one of those long extension cords and i was calling all the dry cleaners in winnipeg to find out how much would the dry cleaners pay me for coat hangers and my mom came into the room and she said where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners is that i think we miss an opportunity to find these kids who have the entrepreneurial traits and to groom them i was going door to door in the neighborhood to collect coat hangers to put in the basement to sell because i saw her a few weeks before that you could get paid they used to pay you two cents per coat hanger so i was just like well there's all kinds of coat hangers and so i'll just go get them and i knew she wouldn't want me to go get them so i just did and i learned that you could actually negotiate with people this one person offered me three cents and i got him up to three and a half i even knew at a seven year old age that i could actually get a fractional percent of a cent and people would pay that because it multiplied up at seven years old i figured it out i got three and a half cents for a thousand coat hangers i sold license plate protectors door to door my dad actually made me go find someone who would sell me these things at wholesale and at nine years old i walked around the city of sudbury but you have two cars and they don't have license plate protectors and he said i know and i said the car here 's got one license plate that's all crumpled up and he said yes that's my wife 's car and i said why don't we just test one on the front of your wife 's car and see if it lasts longer so i knew there were two cars with two license plates on each if i couldn't sell all four i could at least get one i learned that at a young age show them that being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing it's not something that is a bad thing and is vilified which is what happens in a lot of society i did comic book arbitrage when i was about ten years old i sold comic books out of our cottage on georgian bay and i would go biking up to the end of the beach and buy all the comics from the poor kids and then i would go back to the other end of the beach and sell them to the rich kids so that's obvious right it's like a recession so there's a recession there's still thirteen trillion dollars circulating in the u s economy go get some of so not only would he get me one but i had to get two and then he wanted me to hire someone to deliver half the papers which i did and then i realized that collecting tips was where you made all the money so i would collect the tips and get payment so i would go and collect for all the papers he could just deliver them because then i realized i could make the money by this point i was definitely not going to be an employee my dad owned an automotive and industrial repair shop and he had all these old automotive parts lying around and they had this old brass and copper kids when we grow up have dreams and we have passions and we have visions and somehow we get those things crushed i got paid and i thought that was kind of cool strangely enough thirty years later we're building one eight hundred got junk and making money make these chairs and i had these little pillows that i would sew up and you could stuff pins in them because people used to sew and they needed a pin cushion but what i realized was that you had to have options so i actually spray painted a whole bunch of them brown and then when i went to the door it wasn 't do you want to buy one it was which color would you like right like cutting lawns is brutal but because i had to cut lawns all summer for all of our neighbors and get paid to do that i realized that recurring revenue from one client is amazing that if i land this client once and every week i get paid by that person that's way better than trying to sell one i would caddy i would go to the golf course and caddy for people but i realized that there was this one hill on our golf course the thirteenth hole that had this huge hill and people could never get their bags up so i would sit there with a lawn chair and just carry up all the people who didn't have caddies i would carry their golf bags up to the top and they'd pay me a dollar meanwhile my friends were working for five hours some guy 's bag around and get paid ten bucks i'm like that 's stupid because you have to work for five hours that doesn't make any sense you just figure out a way to make more money faster every week i would go to the corner store and buy all these pops then i would go up and deliver them to these seventy year old women playing bridge and they'd give me their orders for the following week and then i'd just deliver pop and i'd just charge twice and i had this captured market you didn't need contracts i went and got golf balls from golf courses but everybody else was looking in the bush and looking in the ditches for golf balls i'm like screw that they're all in the pond and nobody 's going into the pond so i would go into the ponds and crawl around and pick them up with my toes you just pick them up with both feet you can't do it on stage and i packaged them up three ways i had the pinnacles and ddhs and the really cool ones back then those sold for two dollars each and then i had all the good ones that didn't look crappy two years ago i was the highest rated lecturer at mit 's entrepreneurial master 's program and it was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs from around the world to all the kids in high school this is what really kind of gets everybody hating you is because you're trying to extract money from all your friends all the time but it paid the bills so i sold lots and lots of sunglasses and then when the school shut me down the school actually called me into the office and told me i couldn't do it so i went to the gas stations and i sold lots of them to the gas stations and had the gas stations sell them to their customers that was cool because then i had retail outlets and i think i was fourteen and then i paid my entire way through first year university by selling wine skins door to door you know that you can hold a forty oz bottle of rum and two bottles of coke in a wineskin so what right yeah but you know what you stuff that down your shorts when you go into a football game you can get booze in for free everybody bought them you know we teach our kids and we buy them games but why don't we get them games if they're entrepreneurial kids that kind of nurture the traits that you need to be entrepreneurs why don't you teach them not to waste money i remember being told to walk out in the middle of a street in banff alberta because i'd thrown a penny out on the street and my dad said go pick it up he said i work too damn hard for my money i'm not going to see you ever waste a penny and i remember that lesson to this day when i was in grade two i won a city wide speaking competition but nobody had ever said hey this kid 's a good speaker he can't focus but he loves walking around and getting people energized no one said get him a coach in speaking they said get me a tutor in what i breeding kids at a young age to expect a regular paycheck that's wrong for me if you want to raise entrepreneurs what i do with my kids now i've got two nine and seven is i teach them to walk around the house and the yard looking for that needs to get done come to me and tell me what it is or i'll come to them and say here 's what i need done and then you know what we do we negotiate they go around looking for what it is but then we negotiate on what they're going to get paid the fifty percent that goes in their house account every six months goes to the bank they walk up with me every year all the money in the bank goes to their broker both my nine and seven year old have a stock broker already but i'm teaching them to force that savings habit it drives me crazy that thirty year olds are saying maybe i'll start contributing to my rsp now shit you've missed twenty five years a red shirt a blue tie a kangaroo and a laptop and have them tell a story about those four things my kids do that all the time it teaches them to sell it teaches them creativity it teaches them to think on their feet just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it get kids to stand up in front of groups and talk even if it's just stand up in front of their friends and do plays and have speeches those are entrepreneurial traits that you want to be nurturing show the kids what bad customers or bad employees look like show them the grumpy employees when you see grumpy customer service point that out to them say by the way that guys a crappy employee and say these ones are good ones if you go into a restaurant and you have bad customer service show them what bad customer service looks like we've all these lessons in front of us but we don't take those opportunities we teach kids to go get a tutor pull up the photos teach them how to do that kind of stuff and make money then the money they get fifty percent goes in their house account fifty percent goes in their toy account my kids love this stuff two traits that i want you to also look out for that we don't kind of get out of their system don't medicate kids for attention deficit disorder unless it is really really freaking bad the same with the whole things on mania and stress and depression unless it is so clinically brutal man bipolar disorder is nicknamed the ceo disease when steve jurvetson,1
82,CameronSinclair_2006.sph.wav,china the average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is thirty two that's how old i am so it's a young that led to a number of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub saharan africa responding to the hiv aids pandemic the best designed toilet in the world if you're ever ever in india go use this toilet chris luebkeman will tell you why i'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the party but but the future is not going to be the sky scraping cities of new york but this and when you look at this you see crisis what i see is many many inventors one billion people live in abject poverty we hear about them all the time four billion live in growing but fragile economies one in seven live in unplanned settlements if we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen in twenty years one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp look left look right one of you will be there how do we improve the living standards of five billion people with ten million solutions so i wish to develop a community that actively embraces innovative and sustainable design to improve the living conditions that's my wish we open source architecture is the way to go you have a diverse community of participants and we're not just talking about inventors and designers but we're talking about the funding model my role is not as a designer it's a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world and what we need is something that replicates me globally because i haven't slept in seven years in the west taking their idea and basically profiting from it so creative commons has developed the developing nations license and what that means that a designer can the siyathemba project i showed was the first ever building to have a creative commons license on it why not allow designers the opportunity to do this but still protecting their rights here we want to have a community where you can upload ideas and those ideas can be tested in earthquake in flood in all sorts of austere environments the reason that's important is i don't want to wait for the next katrina to find out if my house works that's too late we need to do it now so doing that globally and i want this whole thing to work when you look at the face of an architect most people think a gray haired white guy i don't see that i see the face of the world fifty three countries we also have designers from around the world that participate and we had an exhibit of work that followed so i want everyone from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this design and development the idea of needs based competitions x prize for the other ninety eight percent if you want to call it that we also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together and the idea of integrating manufacturers fab labs in every country when i hear about the one hundred dollar laptop and it's going to educate every child educate every designer in the world put one in every favela every slum settlement because you know what innovation will happen and i need to know that it's called the leap back we talk about leapfrog technologies i write with worldchanging and the one thing we've been talking about is i learn more on the ground than i've ever learned here so let 's take those ideas adapt them and we can use them you on a journey very quickly to explain the wish i'm going to have to take you somewhere which many people haven't been and that's around the world when i was about twenty four years old these ideas are supposed to have adaptable they're allowed to be they should have the potential for evolution they should be developed by every nation on the world and useful for every nation on the world what will it take there should be a sheet i don't have time to read this because i'm going to be yanked off well what will it take you guys are smart so it's going to take a lot of computing power because i want this to i want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system i want every arup engineer in the world to check and make sure that we're doing stuff that's standing because those guys are the best in the world two thousand and four was the tipping point for us we started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in iran and bam also following up on our work in africa and so you know i want these and i just should note i have two laptops and one of them there is there and that has three thousand designs on it if i drop that laptop what happens so it's important to have these proven ideas put up there easy to use easy to get my mom once said there's nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers fed up of talking about making change you only make it by doing it we've changed fema guidelines we've changed public policy we've changed international response based on building things so for me it's important that we create a real conduit for innovation and that it's free innovation think of free culture this is free innovation somebody said this a couple of years back i will give points for those who know it i think the man was maybe twenty five years too early so let 's do it thank you or go down to alabama or mississippi pre katrina and i could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries i've been to so we got involved in and worked in inner cities and elsewhere and then also i will go into some more projects two thousand and five mother nature kicked our arse i think we can pretty much assume that two thousand and five was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters and because of the internet and because of we run from a couple of laptops in the first couple of days i had four thousand emails from people needing help so we began to get involved in projects there and i'll talk about some others and then of course this year we've been responding to katrina as well as following up on our reconstruction works this is a brief overview in two thousand and four i really couldn't manage the number of people who wanted to help or the number of requests that i was getting it was all coming into my laptop and cell phone so we decided to embrace an open kate store and myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work not only about responding to natural disasters but involved in systemic issues problems are local all solutions are local so and that means you know somebody who is based in in mississippi knows more about mississippi than i do so what happened is we used meetup and all these other kind of internet tools and we ended up having forty chapters starting up thousands of architects in one hundred and four countries so the the bullet point sorry i never do a suit so i knew that i was going to take this off ok because i'm going to do it very quick so the past seven years this isn't just about nonprofit what it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller and that we have the opportunity not the responsibility but the opportunity to really get involved in making change i'm adding that to my time so what you don't know is we've got these thousands of designers working around the world connected basically by a website and we have a staff of three by doing something the fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it we did it and so there's something to be said about naivete so seven years later we've developed so that we've got advocacy instigation and implementation we advocate for good design not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums op we have a book on humanitarian work but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy we can talk about fema but that's another talk we believed that where the resources and expertise are scarce innovative sustainable design can really make a difference in people 's lives a reality until it's built so it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change we build that change so here 's a select number of projects kosovo this is kosovo in ninety nine we did an open design competition like i said it led to a whole variety of ideas and this emergency shelter but transitional shelter that would last five to ten years that would be placed next to the land the resident lived in and that they would rebuild their own home this wasn't imposing an architecture on a community this was giving them the tools and and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow the way they want to we have from the sublime to the ridiculous but they worked this is an inflatable hemp house it was built it works this is a shipping container built and works and a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with architectural building but also the issues of governance and the idea of creating communities through complex networks so we've engaged not just designers but also you know a whole variety of technology based professionals using rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes using so this all began my i started my life as an architect or training as an architect and i was always interested in socially and so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk ten fifteen kilometers to see doctors you get the doctors to the people and we started engaging the the medical community and i thought you know we thought we were real bright you know sparks we've come up with this great idea mobile health clinics that can widely distributed throughout sub saharan africa and the community the medical community there said we 've said this for the last decade we know this we just don't know how to show this so in a way we had taken a pre existing need and shown solutions and so again we had a whole variety of ideas that came in this one i personally love because the idea that architecture is not just about solutions but about raising awareness this is a kenaf clinic you get seed and you grow it in a plot of land and then and it grows fourteen feet in a month and on the fourth week the doctors come and they mow out an area put a tensile structure on the top and when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers you cut down the clinic and you eat it it's an eat your own clinic so it's dealing with the fact that if you have aids you also need to have nutrition rates and the idea that the idea of nutrition is as important as getting anti retrovirals out there so you know this is a serious solution this one i love the idea is it's not just a clinic it's a community center this looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community so it can be a self sustaining project every one of these projects is sustainable you have to know where your energy is coming from you have to know where your resource is coming from and you have to keep the maintenance down so this is about getting an economic engine and then at night it turns into a movie theater so it's not an aids clinic it's a community center so you can see ideas and these ideas from that we also developed siyathemba which was a project the community came to us and said the problem is that the girls don't have education and we're working in an area where young women between the ages of sixteen and twenty four have a fifty percent hiv aids many architects seemed to think that when you design you design a jewel and it's a jewel that you try and crave for whereas i felt that when you design and that's not because they're promiscuous it's because there's no knowledge and so we decided to look at the idea of sports and create a youth sports center that doubled as an hiv aids outreach center and the coaches of the girls team were also trained doctors so that there would be a very slow way of developing they said this is our design because it's not only about engaging a community it's about empowering a community and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process so the winning design is here and then of course we actually go and work with the community and the clients so this is the designer he 's out there working with the first ever women 's soccer team in kwa zulu natal siyathemba and a consultant and i'm also the national also play in for the team called tembisa which has now changed to this is in tanzania and we met literally a couple of months ago we've already developed a design and the team is over there working in partnership this was a matchmaking thanks to a couple of tedsters and andrew zolli who connected me with this amazing african woman and we start construction in june and it will be opened by tedglobal so when you come to tedglobal you can check it out but what we're known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development and we've been involved in a lot of issues such as the tsunami and also things like hurricane katrina this is a three hundred and seventy dollar shelter that can be easily assembled this is a community design a community designed community center and what that means is we actually live and work with the community and they're part of the design process the kids actually get involved in mapping out where the the community center should be and then eventually the community is actually through skills training end up building the building with us here is another school this is what the u n gave these guys for six months twelve plastic tarps this was in august so we said if the rain 's coming down let 's get fresh water so every one of our schools have rain water collection systems very low cost we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in kosovo and i didn't know what i was doing like i say mid twenties it's built by the parents of the kids the kids are out there on site building the buildings and it opened a couple of weeks ago and there's six hundred kids that are now using the schools so disaster hits home we've see the bad stories on cnn and fox and all that but we don't see the good stories here is a community that got together and they said no to wait to waiting they formed a partnership a diverse partnership of to actually map out east biloxi to figure out who is getting involved we've had one thousand five hundred volunteers rebuilding rehabbing homes utility room for a woman who is on a walker she's seventy years old this is what fema gave her six hundred bucks happened two days ago we put together very quickly a washroom it's built it's running and she just started a business today where she's washing other peoples clothes this is the calhouns they're photographers who have documented the lower ninth for the last forty years that was their home and these are the photographs they took and we're helping working with them to create a new building and i'm the i'm the internet generation so we started a website we put a call out there and to my surprise in a couple of months we had hundreds of entries from around the world this is the u n tent this is the new u n tent just introduced this year quick to assemble it's got a flap that's the invention it took twenty years to design this and get it implemented in the field i was twelve years old there's a problem here luckily we're not alone there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds more hemp houses it's a theme in japan this is a grip clip designed by somebody who said all you need is some way to attach membrane structures to physical support beams this guy designed for nasa is now doing housing i'm going to whip through this quickly because i know i've got only a couple of minutes,1
83,CameronSinclair_2009G.sph.wav,when the contractors had gone bust as they'd been over leveraged like everyone else the difference is everything goes missing documentation passports and tickets home for these workers currently right now thousands of workers are abandoned there is no way back home and there is no way and no proof of arrival these are the boom and bust refugees the question is as a building professional as an architect if you know this is going on as we go to the sights every single week are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations so let 's forget your environmental footprint let 's think about your ethical footprint what good is it to build a zero carbon energy efficient complex when the labor producing this architectural gem is unethical at best now recently i've been told i've been taking the high road but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road so let 's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse and that as we worry about our next job in the office the next design that we can get to keep our workers years ago my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry in two thousand and six young qatari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps and since then i've followed the let 's not forget these men who are truly dying to work thank you one point one million of them mainly indian pakistani sri lankan and nepalese these laborers risk everything to make money for their families back home they pay a middle man thousands of dollars to be there and when they arrive they find themselves in labor camps with no water no air conditioning and their passports taken away while it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities ninety nine percent of these people are hired by the private sector and so therefore we are equally if not more accountable in august two thousand and eight uae public officials noted that forty percent of the country 's one thousand and ninety eight labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations and last summer more than ten thousand workers protested for the non payment of wages for the poor quality of food and inadequate housing and then the financial collapse happened,1

drawing near or at least not as much as i did before i can actually hear it now because i see my time is ticking off and the you know salute the sun but only want to give over about twenty minutes to it i mean these are sort of the extreme examples and they're amusing and of all of that is that i actually feel a lot happier healthier more productive than i ever have i feel like i'm i'm living my life rather than actually just racing through it and perhaps the most important measure of the success of this is that i feel that my relationships are a lot deeper richer stronger and for me the i guess the litmus test for whether this would work and what it would mean was always going to be bedtime stories because that's sort of where the the journey began and there too the news is rosy i you know at the end of the day i go into my son 's room i don't wear a watch i switch off my computer so i can't hear the email pinging into the basket and i just slow down to his pace and and we read and because children have their own tempo and internal clock they don't do quality time where you schedule ten minutes for them to open up to you they need you to move at their rhythm i find that ten minutes into a story you know my son will suddenly say you know used to be a kind of a box on my to do list something that i dreaded because it was so slow and i had to get through it quickly it's become my reward at the end of the day something i really i really cherish and i have a kind of hollywood ending to my talk this afternoon which goes a little bit like this a few months ago i was getting ready to go on another book tour and i had my bags packed i was downstairs by the front door character tintin on the front and he said to me or he handed this to me and and i read it and it said to daddy love benjamin and i thought aah that's really sweet you know is a good luck on the book tour card and he said no no no daddy this is a card for being the best story reader in the world and i thought yeah you know this slowing down thing thank you very much of the damage that this roadrunner form of living does to us we're so marinated in the culture of speed that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives on our health our diet our work our relationships the environment and our community and sometimes it takes i'd like to start off with is an observation which is that if i've learned anything over the last year it's that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast a a wake up call doesn't it to to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives instead of actually living them that we're living the fast life instead of the good life and i think for many people that wake up call takes the form of an illness you a burn out or eventually the body says i can't take it anymore and throws in the towel or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we haven't had the time or the patience or the tranquility to be with the other person to listen to them my wake up call came when i started reading bedtime stories to my son and i found that at the end of day i would go into his room and i just couldn't slow down you know i'd be speed reading the cat so we would quarrel and what should have been the most relaxing the most intimate the most tender moment of the day when a dad sits down to read to became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills a clash between his speed and my or my speed and his slowness and this went on for some time until i caught myself scanning a newspaper article with time saving tips for fast people and one of them made reference to a series of books called the one minute bedtime story and i i wince saying those words now but my first reaction at the time was very different my first reflex was to say hallelujah what a great idea this is exactly what i'm looking for to speed up bedtime even more but thankfully a light bulb went on over my head and my next reaction was very different and i took a step back and i thought whoa you know has it really come to this am i really in such a hurry that i'm prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day i seem to spend most of my time these days you know zipping from city to city studio to studio interview to interview serving up the book in really tiny bite size chunks the first was how did we get so fast and the second is is it possible or even desirable to slow down now if you think about how our world got so accelerated the usual suspects rear their heads you think of you know urbanization consumerism the workplace technology but i think if you cut through those forces you get to what might be the deeper driver the nub of the question which is how we think about time itself in other cultures time is cyclical it's seen as moving in great unhurried circles it's always renewing and refreshing itself whereas in the west time is linear it's a finite resource it's always draining away you either use it or lose it time is money as benjamin franklin said and i think what that that does to us psychologically moment of every day into a race to the finish line a finish line incidentally that we never reach but a finish line nonetheless tells us that faster is always better and that busier is best right across the world people are doing the unthinkable they're slowing down and finding that although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down you're roadkill because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down but they want to know how to slow down really quickly so so i did a spot on cnn the other day where i actually spent more time in makeup than i did talking on air the opposite turns out to be true that by slowing down at the right moments people find that they do everything better they eat better they make love better they exercise better they work better they live better and in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration lie what a lot of people now refer to as the international slow movement now if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy a very quick overview of what what's going on inside the slow movement if you think of food many of you will have heard of the slow food movement and more health from our food when we cultivate cook and consume it at a reasonable pace i think also the explosion of organic farming movement and the renaissance farmers markets is another are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable they want to get back to slower rhythms and out of the slow food movement has grown something called the slow cities movement which has started in italy but has spread right across europe and beyond and in this towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape so that people are encouraged to to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another so they might becomes officially a slow city it's kind of like a philosophical declaration it's saying to the rest of world and to the people in that town that we believe that in the twenty one st century slowness has a role to play in medicine i think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned with the kind of quick fix mentality you find in conventional medicine and millions of them around the world are turning to to complementary and alternative forms of medicine and i think that that's not really surprising though is it because that's kind of the world that we we live in now a world stuck in fast forward which tend to tap into sort of slower gentler more holistic forms of healing now obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies and i personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever you know gain mainstream approval other treatments such as acupuncture and massage and even just relaxation clearly have some kind of benefit and blue chip medical colleges everywhere and i saw a magazine a men 's magazine and it said on the front how to bring your partner to orgasm in thirty seconds so you know even sex is on a stopwatch these days now you know i like a quickie as much as the next person but i think that there's an awful lot to be gained from slow sex from slowing down in the bedroom you you tap into that those deeper sort of you know psychological emotional spiritual currents and you get a better orgasm a world obsessed with speed with doing everything faster with cramming more and more into less and less time every moment of the day feels like with the buildup you can get more bang for your buck let 's say i mean the pointer sisters said it most eloquently didn't they when they sang the praises of a lover with a slow hand now we all laughed at sting a few years ago when he went tantric but you fast forward a few years and now you find couples of all ages flocking to workshops or maybe just on their own in their own bedrooms finding ways to put on the brakes and have better sex and of course in italy where i mean italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure they've launched an official slow sex movement the workplace right across much of the world north america being a notable exception working hours have been coming down and europe is an example of that and people finding that their quality of life improves as they're working less and also that their hourly productivity goes up now clearly there are problems with the thirty five hour work week in france too much too soon too rigid but other countries in europe notably the nordic countries are showing that it's possible to have a kick ass economy without being a workaholic and norway sweden denmark and finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on earth and they work the kind of hours that would make the average american weep with envy and if you go beyond sort of the country level down at the micro company level more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to take a lunch break or to go sit in a quiet room to switch off their blackberrys you at the back a race against the clock to borrow a phrase from carrie fisher which is is in my bio there i'll just toss it out again these days even instant gratification takes too long and mobile phones during the work day or on the weekend so that they have time to recharge and to for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought it's not just though these days adults who overwork though is it it's children too i'm thirty seven and my childhood ended in the mid eighties and i look at kids now and i'm just amazed by the way they race around with more homework more tutoring more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago and some of the most heartrending emails that i get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout pleading with me to their parents to help them slow down to help them get off this full throttle treadmill less can be more so there was a case up in scotland recently where a fee paying high achieving private school banned homework for everyone under the age of thirteen and the high achieving parents freaked out and said what are you you know our kids will fall the headmaster said no no your children need to slow down at the end of the day and just this last month the elite universities who are often cited as the reason that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much are starting to notice the caliber of students coming to them is falling these kids have wonderful marks if you think about how we to try to make things better what do we do no we speed them up don't we so we used to dial now we speed dial we used to read now we speed read we used to walk now we speed walk and of course we used to date and now we speed date and so what these ivy league schools and oxford and cambridge and so on are starting to send a message to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit and in harvard for instance they send out a letter to undergraduates freshmen telling them that they'll get more out of life and more out of harvard if they put on the brakes if they do less but give time to things the time that things need to enjoy them to savor them and even if they sometimes do nothing at all and that letter is called very revealing i think slow down with an exclamation mark on the end so wherever you look the message it seems to me is the same that less is very often more that slower is very often better but that said of course it's not that easy to slow down is it i mean you heard that i got a speeding ticket while i was researching my book on the benefits of slowness and that's true but that's not all of it i was actually en route to a dinner held by slow food at the time and if that's not shaming enough i got that ticket in italy and if any of you have ever driven on an italian highway you'll have a pretty good idea of how fast i was going but why is it so hard to slow down i think there are various reasons one is that that speed is fun you know speed is sexy it's all that adrenaline rush it's hard to give it up i think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger deeper questions we fill our head with distraction with so that we don't have to ask am i well am i happy are my children growing up right are politicians making good decisions on my with being stupid i guess what the slow movement the purpose of the slow movement or its main goal really is to tackle that taboo and to say that that yes but the new idea the sort of revolutionary idea of the slow movement is that there is such a thing as good slow too and good slow is you know taking the time to eat a meal with your family with the tv switched off and savor your life now one of the things that i found most uplifting about all of this stuff that's happened around the book since it came out is the reaction to it and i knew that when my book on slowness came out it would be welcomed by the new age brigade but it's also been taken up with great gusto by the corporate world business press but also you know big companies and leadership organizations because people at the top of the chain people like you i think are starting to realize that there's too much another encouraging sign i think is that it's not just in the developed world that this idea 's been taken up in the developing world in countries that are on the verge of making that leap into first world status china brazil thailand poland and so on these countries are have embraced the idea of the slow movement many people in them and there's a debate going on in their media on the streets because i think they're looking at the west and we like that aspect of what you've got but we're not so sure about that so all of that said is it i guess is it possible that's really the main question before us today is it possible to slow down and i i'm happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a resounding yes and i present myself as exhibit a a kind of reformed and rehabilitated speed aholic i still love speed you know i live in london and i work as a journalist and i enjoy the buzz and the busy ness and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things i play,1
85,CarlSafina_2010X.sph.wav,we should just get rid of them but in the entire rest of government right now and for the last at least thirty years there has been a culture of deregulation that is caused directly by the people who we need to be protected from buying the government out from under us complained that they were already bidding defiance to the laws of our country they would tell these corporations to go to hell that's what it would really mean to be conservative so what we really need to do is regain the idea that it's our government all the fossil fuels have changed the atmosphere greatly carbon dioxide level has gone up and up and up we're warming the climate i think there are signs of hope we seem to be waking up a little bit the glass steagall act which was really to protect us from the kind of thing that caused the recession to happen now there's a mood to put some of that stuff back in place but the lobbyists are all ready there trying to weaken the regulations after the legislation has just passed so it's a continued fight it's a historic moment right now we're either going to have an absolutely unmitigated catastrophe of this oil leak in the gulf or we will make the moment we need out of this as many people have noted today there's certainly a common theme about needing to make the moment out of this we've been through this before with other ways of offshore drilling the first now are we stuck with this ever since we lived in caves every time we wanted any energy we lit something on fire and that is still what we're doing we're still lighting something on fire every time we want energy and people say we can't have clean energy because it's too expensive so the blowout in the gulf is just a little piece of a much larger problem that we have with the energy that we use to run civilization who says it's too expensive people who sell us fossil fuels we've been here before with energy and people saying the economy cannot withstand a switch because the cheapest energy was slavery energy is always a moral issue it's an issue that is moral right now it's a matter of right and wrong thank you very much beyond warming we have the problem of the oceans getting more acidified and already measurably so and already effecting animals now in the laboratory if you take a clam and you put it in the ph that is not eight point one which is the normal ph of seawater but seven point five it dissolves in about three days if you take sea urchin larva from eight point one put it in a ph of seven point seven not a huge change it becomes deformed and dies and already coral reefs are growing slower in some places because of this problem so this really matters now let 's take a little tour around the gulf a little bit the ocean as i used to know things that really impresses me about the people in the gulf they are really really aquatic people and they can handle water they can handle a hurricane that comes and goes when the water goes down they know what to do but when it's something other than water and their water habitat changes they don't have many options in fact those entire communities really don't have and i find that since i've been in the gulf a couple of times i really kind of am traumatized because whenever i look at the ocean now no matter where i am many options they don't have another thing they can do they can't go and work in the local hotel business because there isn't one in their community if you go to the gulf and you look around you do see a lot of oil you see a lot of oil on the ocean you see a lot of oil on the shoreline if you go to the site of the blowout it looks pretty unbelievable it looks like you just emptied the oil pan in your car and you just dumped it in the ocean and one of the really most incredible things i think is that there's nobody out there trying to collect it at the site where it is densest parts of the ocean there look just absolutely apocalyptic you go in along the shore you can find it everywhere it's really messy if you go to the places where it's just arriving like the eastern part of the gulf in alabama there's still people using the beach while there are people cleaning up the beach and they have a very strange way of cleaning up the beach they're not allowed to put more than ten lbs of you see people who are really shell shocked they are very hardworking people all they know about life is they get up in the morning and if their engine starts they go to work they always felt that they could rely on the assurances that nature brought them through the ecosystem of the gulf and they're finding that their world is really collapsing and so you can see literally signs of even where i know none of the oil has gone i sort of see slicks and i'm finding that i'm very much haunted their shock signs of their outrage signs of their anger and signs of their grief these are the things that you can see and and i learned in fact i confirmed the hypothesis that oil and water don't mix until you add a dispersant and then they start mixing and you add a little energy from the wind and the waves and you get a big mess by it a big mess that you can't possibly clean you can't touch you can't extract and i think most importantly this is what i think you can't see it i think it's being hidden on purpose now this is such a catastrophe and such a mess but what i want to talk to you about today is a lot of things that try to put all of this in context not just about the oil eruption but that lots of stuff is leaking out on the edges of the information stream but as many people have said there's a large attempt to suppress what's going on personally i think that dispersants are a major strategy to hide the body because we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene but you can see it you can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface and then it is attacked because they don't want the evidence in my opinion okay we heard that bacteria eat oil so do sea turtles when it breaks up it has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria turtles eat it it gets in the gills of fish these guys have to swim around through it i heard the most incredible story today when i was on the train coming here a writer named ted williams called me and he was asking me a couple of questions about what i saw because he 's writing an article for audubon magazine he said that he had been in the gulf a little while ago like about a week ago and a guy who had been a recreational fishing guide took him out to show him what's going on that guide 's entire calendar year is ted that on the last day he went out a bottlenosed dolphin suddenly appeared next to the boat and it was splattering oil out its blowhole what it means and why it has happened first just a little bit about me i'm basically just a guy that likes to go fishing ever since i was a little kid and he now in the exxon valdez spill about thirty percent of the killer whales died in the first few months their numbers have never recovered so the recovery rate of all this stuff is going to be variable it's going to take so the gulf is a really important piece of water more important than a similar volume of water in the open atlantic ocean and because i did i wound up studying sea birds to try to stay in the coastal habitats that i so loved very much right in the area of the slick they're probably having at the very least a catastrophic spawning season this year i'm hoping that maybe the adults are avoiding that dirty water they don't usually like to go into water that is very cloudy anyway but these are really high performance athletic animals i don't know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills i don't know if it'll effect the adults if it's not it's certainly effecting their eggs and larvae i would certainly think i think it's important to keep in mind that we've done a lot to effect what's in the ocean for a very very long time it's not like we're starting with something that's been okay we're starting with something that's had a lot of stresses and a lot of problems to begin with if you look around at the birds there are a lot of birds in the gulf that concentrate in the gulf at certain times of the year but then leave and they populate much larger areas and now i mainly write books about how the ocean is changing and the ocean is certainly changing very rapidly now we saw this kind of graphic earlier on so for instance most of the birds in this picture are migratory birds they were all on the gulf in may while oil was starting to come ashore in certain places down on the lower left there are ruddy turnstones and sanderlings they breed in the high arctic and they winter down in southern south america but they so this is a hemispheric issue the economic effects go at least nationally in many ways the biological effects are certainly hemispheric i think that this is one of the most absolutely mindboggling examples of total unpreparedness that i can even think of even when the japanese bombed pearl harbor at least they shot back and we just seem to be unable to figure out what to do there was nothing ready and you know as we can see by what they're doing mainly what they're doing is booms and dispersants the booms are absolutely not made for open water they don't even attempt to corral the oil where it is most concentrated they get near shore look at these two boats that one on the right is called fishing fool and i think you know that's a great name for boats that they're going to do anything to make a dent in this by dragging a boom between them when there are literally hundreds of thousands of square miles in the gulf right now with oil at the surface the dispersants make the oil go right under the booms the booms are only about thirteen inches in diameter that we really live on a hard marble that has just a slight bit of wetness to it it's like you dipped a marble in water so it's just absolutely crazy here are shrimp boats employed there are hundreds of shrimp boats employed to drag booms instead of nets here they are working you can see easily that all the oily water just goes over the back of the boom all they're doing is stirring it it's just ridiculous also for all the shoreline that has booms hundreds and hundreds of miles of shoreline all of the shoreline that has booms there's adjacent shoreline that doesn't have any booms there is ample opportunity for oil and dirty water to get in behind them and that lower photo that's a bird colony that has been boomed everybody 's trying trying to protect the bird colonies there well as an ornithologist i can tell you that birds fly and that and that booming a bird colony doesn't do it it doesn't do it these birds make a living by diving into the water in fact really what i think they should do if anything they're trying so hard to protect those nests actually if they destroyed every single nest some of the birds would leave and that would be better for them this year and the same thing with the atmosphere if you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball you would get that little sphere of gas on the right so we live as far as cleaning them i don't mean to cast any aspersion on people cleaning birds it's really really important that we express our compassion i think that's the most important thing that people have is compassion it's really important to get those images and to show it but really where are those birds going to get released to it's like taking somebody out of a burning building treating them for smoke inhalation and sending them back into the building because the oil is still gushing to acknowledge this as anything like an accident i think that this is the result of gross negligence not just b p b p operated very and very recklessly because they could and they were allowed to do so because of the absolute failure of oversight of the government that's supposed to be our government protecting us it turns out that you see this sign on almost every commercial vessel in the united states you know if you spilled a couple of gallons of oil you would be in big trouble and you have to really wonder who are the laws made for and who has gotten above the laws now there are things that we can do in the future we could have the kinds of equipment that we would really need it would not take an awful lot to anticipate that after making thirty thousand holes in the sea floor of the gulf of mexico looking for oil on the most fragile little soap bubble you can imagine a very sacred soap bubble but one that is very very easy to effect and all the burning of oil and coal and gas oil might start coming out of one of them and you'd have some idea of what to do that's certainly one of the things we need to do but i think we have to understand where this leak really started from it really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there because it's our government meant to protect the larger public interest so i think that the oil blowout the bank bailout the mortgage crisis and all these things are absolutely symptoms of the same cause we still seem to understand that at least we need the police to protect us from a few bad people and even though the police can be a little annoying at times giving us tickets and stuff like that nobody says that,1
86,CarmenAgraDeedy_2005.sph.wav,i said look please let me take care of her ok because i know her and believe me she's like a small atomic weapon you know you just want to handle her really gingerly and the girl goes i know but i mean i swear to god she reminds us of our mother he turns to her on the heel of his shoe it's a half whisper they turn then shoulder to shoulder and walk away lost in their own reverie you crazy probably for about fourteen fifteen more years if you're lucky but after that honey going my father is at once quick witted i already heard your mother i think she's right after what i just told you good storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to great story is the art of letting go from the mists of avalon back in time but further still when i knew i was going to come and speak to you we were doing the pictographs on walls in moist damp caves been watching the commercials because every one of us has this desire for once just once to tell our story and have it heard late at night to a friend maybe once in your life and then there are stories we whisper into a stygian darkness it's about human connection my cuban mother which i just briefly introduced you to in that short character sketch a small southern town and in that little southern town i grew up and grew up hearing these stories but this story only happened a few years ago i called my mom it was a saturday morning and i was calling about how to make ajiaco it's a cuban meal it's delicious it's savory it makes spit froth in the little corners of your mouth it makes your armpits juicy you know that big four feet nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts you still with me food yeah this is the sensory part of the program people i called my mother and she said carmen i need you to come please i need to go to the mall and you know your father now he takes a nap in the afternoon and i got to go i got an errand to run let me esther my mother had stopped driving several years ago to the collective relief of the entire city of atlanta any vehicular outing with that woman from the time i was a young child guys naturally included flashing blue lights but she'd become adept at dodging the boys in blue and when she did meet them oh she had wonderful did you know that was you don't speak english i called her up hello how 're you doing baby hey ma i got to talk to you you 're talking to me already what's the matter i said i 've got to talk to a bunch of nice people and that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up to take her to have her hair dyed you know that peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pants suit this is the woman that wants me to come on a saturday morning when i have a lot to do but it doesn't take long because cuban guilt is a weighty thing political on you but and so i go to my mother 's i show up she's in the carport of course they have a carport the kind with the corrugated roof you know the buick 's parked outside and she's jingling jangling a pair of keys i got a surprise she gets into the car she's sitting on two phone books i can't even make this part up because she's that tiny she's engineered an umbrella so she can bam slam the door nice people except when you went to the white house and so we left my father fast asleep down because they expect you to use them and there she goes she has been out and not been stopped so we can talk it'll be a diversion it'll help my breathing it'll do something for my pulse maybe mommy i know you have been stopped ok so i stopped at a light and there's a guy you know in the back would this guy have like a blue uniform and a terrified look on his face i have to tell you as she did because it loses something if i and he does a thing like this you i like a cat batting back a mouse batting back a mouse left paw right paw left paw right the mall now you all have all been at a mall during the holidays yes talk to so first i say ma why are we here you mean like in the are we here today because i have to exchange your father it's technology entertainment and design do i want to walk in because unless i have ariadne 's thread to anchor enough metaphors for you somewhere i may not get out but you know why do we have to take pop 's underwear back now and why what is wrong with he 's supposed to buy the why i read it on the internet you cannot have now we have now crawled another four feet my mother finally says to me i knew it i knew it i'm an immigrant we make a space what i tell you right there and she points out the passenger window and i look out and three three aisles down look the you design a story when you make it up it's entertainment when you tell it and you're going to use a microphone know that honey get out of the car and go stand in the parking space this is you know you'd think by now i'm and the car knocks out the phone books and then she walks around she's carrying her cheap kmart purse with her around the front of the car speed for a woman her age too before i know it she has skiddled across the parking lot and in between the cars and people behind me with that kind of usual religious charity that the holidays bring us a brevity brevity of everything with this child you know she eats small portions language is something to be meted out in small phonemes you know just but she pauses occasionally and says how do you spell that she writes the expose in about twenty years don't believe a word of it but this is my daughter lauren my remarkable daughter my borderline asperger 's kid pearls of wisdom leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you she says ma now when this i look in bewildered awe she's standing those rockports slightly apart but grounded she's holding out that cheap

87,CarneRoss_2009P.sph.wav,interstate conflict today eighty percent of the agenda of the u n security council is about conflicts within states and when i look back on my time at the security council and what happened with the kosovars and i realize that often the people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the security council weren't actually actually invited to give their views to the security council i thought this is wrong something 's got to be done about this so i started off in a traditional me and my colleagues at independent diplomat went around the u n security council we went around seventy u n member states the kazaks the ethiopians the israelis you name them we went to see them more effective and durable you would think i mean incredibly logical so obvious anybody could it and of course everybody got it everybody went yes of course your absolutely right come back to us in maybe six months i was fascinated by the cold war by the inf negotiations over intermediate range nuclear missiles the proxy war between the soviet union and the u s in angola or afghanistan so we looked at that observation of basically failure and thought what can we do about it and i thought if i'm going to spend the rest of my life lobbying for these crumby governments to do what needs to be done so what we're going to do is we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves so now independent diplomat is in the process of setting up meetings between the u n security council and the parties to the disputes that are on the agenda of the security council so we will be bringing darfuri rebel the northern cypriots and the southern cypriots rebels from and awful long laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world and we will be trying to bring the parties to new york to sit down in a quiet room in a private setting with no press and actually explain what they want to the members of the u n security council of course describing all this any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult and i entirely agree with you the chances of failure are very high if we don't try to make it happen and my politics has changed fundamentally from when i was a diplomat to what i am today and i think that outputs is what matters not process not technology frankly so much and in a way independent diplomat embodies that fragmentation that change that is happening to all of us these things really interested me and so i decided quite at an early age i wanted to be a diplomat and i one day i announced this to my parents and my father denies this story to this day i said daddy i want to be a diplomat and he turned to me and he said carne you have to be very clever i entered the british foreign service that year five thousand people applied to become a diplomat and twenty of us succeeded and as those numbers suggest i was inducted into an elite and fascinating and exhilarating world my story is a little bit about war it's about disillusionment it's about death and it's about rediscovering idealism being a diplomat then and now is an incredible job and i loved every minute of it i enjoyed the status of it i bought myself a nice suit and wore leather soled shoes and reveled in this amazing access i had to world events i traveled to the gaza strip i headed the middle east peace process section in the british foreign ministry i became a speechwriter for the british foreign secretary i met yasser arafat i negotiated with saddam 's diplomats at the u n later i traveled to kabul and served in afghanistan after the fall of the taliban and i would travel in a c one hundred and thirty transport and visit warlords in mountain hideaways and negotiate with them about how we were going to eradicate al qaeda from dangerous and that was exciting that was fun it was really interesting and but i was posted to new york to serve on the u n security council for the british delegation and my responsibility was the middle east which was my specialty and there i dealt with things like the middle east peace process the lockerbie issue we can talk about that later if you wish but above all my responsibility was iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons i was the chief british negotiator on the subject and i was steeped in the issue and anyway it was kind of a very exciting time i mean it was very dramatic diplomacy we went through several wars during my time in new york i negotiated for my country the resolution in the security council of the twelfth of september two thousand and one condemning the attacks of the day before which were of course deeply present to us actually living in new york at the time so it was kind of the best of time worst of times kind of experience i lived the high life i worked very long hours i lived in a penthouse in union square i was a single british diplomat in new york city you can imagine what that might have meant i had a good time in two thousand and two when my tour came to an end i decided i wasn't going to go back to the job that was waiting for me in london i decided to take a sabbatical in fact at the new school bruce in some inchoate inarticulate way i realized that there was something wrong with my work with me i was exhausted and i was also disillusioned in a way i couldn't quite put my finger on and i decided to take some time out from work the foreign office was very generous you could take these special unpaid leave as they called them and yet remain part of the diplomatic service but not actually do any work i was nice and eventually i decided to take a secondment to join the u n in kosovo which was then under u n administration and two things happened in kosovo which kind of again shows the randomness of life because these things turned out to be two of the pivots of my life and helped to deliver me to the next stage but they were random things one was that in the summer of two thousand and four the british government somewhat reluctantly decided to have an official inquiry into the use of intelligence on wmd in the run up to the iraq war a very limited subject and i testified to that inquiry in secret i had been steeped in the intelligence on iraq and its wmd and my testimony to the inquiry said three things that i don't believe in straightforward narratives i don't believe in a life or history written as decision a led to consequence b led to consequence c these neat narratives that we're presented with the government exaggerated the intelligence which was very clear in all the years i'd read it and indeed our own internal assessment was very clear discreditable thing still the third reason i won 't go into but anyway i gave that testimony and that presented my with a crisis what was i going to do this testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues of my ministers and so i was in crisis and this wasn't a pretty thing it i hesitated i went on and on and on to my long suffering wife and eventually i decided to resign from the british foreign service i felt in the al pacino movie the insider which you may know where he goes back to cbs after they've let him down the tobacco guy and he goes you know i just can't do this anymore something 's broken and it was like that for me i love that movie i felt just something 's broken i can't actually sit with my foreign minister or my prime minister again with a smile on my face and do what i used to do gladly for them so took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff and it was a very very uncomfortable unpleasant feeling and i started to fall and today that fall hasn't stopped i'm still falling but in a way i've got used to the sensation of it and in a way i kind of like the sensation of it a lot better than i like actually standing on top of the cliff wondering what to do a second thing happened in kosovo which kind of i need a quick gulf of water forgive me a second thing happened in kosovo which kind of delivered the answer which i couldn't really answer which is and that perhaps we encourage in each other i believe in randomness and one of the reasons i believe that is because me becoming a diplomat was random what do i do with my life i love diplomacy i have no career i expected my entire life to be a diplomat to be serving my country i wanted to be an ambassador my mentors my heroes in march two thousand and four there were terrible riots all over the province as it then was of kosovo eighteen people were killed it was will stop is when they decide to stop and when they've had enough burning and killing and that is not a very nice feeling to see and i saw it and i went through it i went through those mobs and with my albanian friends we tried to stop it but we failed me something which isn't immediately obvious and it's kind of a complicated story but one of the reasons that riot took place those riots which went on for several days took place was because the kosovo people were disenfranchised from their own future were diplomatic negotiations about the future of kosovo going on then and the kosovo government let alone the kosovo people were not actually participating in those talks there was this whole fancy diplomatic system this negotiation process about the future of kosovo and the kosovars weren't part of it and funnily enough they were frustrated about that i'm colorblind i was born unable to see most colors this is why i wear gray and black most of the time and i have to take my wife with me to chose clothes and the only reason and life is not simple one reason narratives it was a complicated thing and i'm not pretending it was more simple than it was but that was one of the reasons and that kind of gave me the inspiration or rather to be precise it gave my wife the inspiration she said why don't you advise the kosovars why don't you advise their government on their diplomacy and the kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service they were not allowed diplomats they were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process which became known as the final status process of kosovo and so that was the idea that was the origin of the thing that became independent diplomat the world 's first diplomatic advisory group and a non profit to and it began when i flew back from london after my time at the u n in kosovo i flew back and had dinner with the kosovo prime minister and said to him that i come and advise you on the diplomacy i know this stuff it's what i do why don't i come and help you and he the multi party negotiation team of kosovo and kosovo became independent independent diplomat is now established in five diplomatic centers around the world and we're advising seven or eight different countries you heard it here first is going to be a new country within the next few years we're advising polisario front of the western sahara who are fighting to get their country back from moroccan occupation after thirty four years of dispossession we're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations which is suppose to culminate in copenhagen to be a fighter pilot when i was a boy i loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside and it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot and a bit of randomness here too because when i was beginning independent diplomat i went to a party in the house of lords which is a ridiculous place i was holding my drink like this and i bumped into this guy who was standing behind me and we started talking and he said i told him what i was doing and i rather grandly i was going to establish independent diplomat in new york at that time there was just me and me and my wife were moving back to new york and he said why don't you see my colleagues in new york and it turned out he worked for an innovation company called what if which some of you have probably heard of and one thing led to another and i ended up having a desk in what if in new york when i started independent diplomat and watching what if develop new flavors of chewing gum for wrigley or new flavors for coke actually helped me innovate new strategies for the and yet the word innovation doesn't exist in diplomacy it's all zero sum games and realpolitik and ancient institutions that have been there for generations and do things the same way they've always done things and independent diplomat today tries to incorporate some of the things i learned at what if we all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office we all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think and we use naive experts who may know nothing about the countries we're dealing with but may know something about something else to try to inject new thinking into the problems that we try to address for our clients it's not easy because our clients by definition are having a difficult time i did the tests in the royal air force to become a pilot and sure enough i failed i couldn't see all the blinking different lights and i can't distinguish color diplomatically there are i don't know some lessons from all of this personal and political and in a way they're the same thing the personal one off a cliff is actually a good thing and i recommend it and it's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump the second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today independent diplomat is part of a trend the world which is that the world is fragmenting states mean less than they used to and the power of the state is declining that means the power of others things is rising those other things are called non state actors they may be corporations they may be mafiosi they may be nice ngos they may anything any number of things we are living in a more complicated and fragmented world if governments are less able to affect the problems in the world who 's left to deal with it we have no choice but to embrace that reality what this means is it's no longer good enough to say that international relations or global affairs or chaos in somalia so i had to chose another career and this was in fact relatively easy for me because i had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood which was international relations as a child i read the newspaper what's going on in burma is none of your business and that you can leave it to governments to get on with i can connect any one of you by six degrees of separation to the al shabaab militia in somalia how later but if you eat fish interestingly enough but that connection is there we are all intimately connected and this isn't just tom friedman it's actually provable in case after case after case what that means is instead of asking your politicians to do things you have to look to yourself to do things,1
88,CarolineLavelleFARTHERTHANTHESUN_2005.sph.wav,you a to me farther you now i've got a story for you when i arrived off the plane after a very long journey from the west of england my computer my beloved laptop had gone mad and you 's had oh a bit like that and the display on it anyway the whole thing i went to the it guys here and a gentleman mended my computer and then he said what are you doing here and of is,1
89,CarolinePhillips_2010G.sph.wav,luckily all of this changed a couple of centuries later so one person could actually play and almost this is pretty heavy carry the hurdy gurdy the hurdy gurdy has been used historically through the centuries in mostly dance music because of the uniqueness of the melody combined with the acoustic boombox here and today the hurdy gurdy is used in all sorts of music traditional folk music dance contemporary and world music in the u k in france in spain and in italy and this kind of hurdy gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years it's made by specialized luthiers also in europe and it's very difficult to tune so to sing in basque which is the language spoken in the basque country where i live a region in france and spain this is tedglobal who can tell me what this is called in french i see you're all up on the history of hurdy gurdy vielle and in spanish zanfona and in italian ghironda okay hurdy gurdy or wheel fiddle so these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy gurdy the hurdy gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a crank to turn a wheel drone string which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe the second string is a melody string which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano and the third is pretty innovative it's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique it activates what's called the buzzing bridge or the dog i turn the crank and i apply pressure it makes a sound like a barking dog okay all of this is pretty innovative if you consider that the hurdy gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago and it took two people to play it one to turn the crank and another person yes to play the melody by physically pulling up large wooden pegs,1
90,CarolynPorco_2007.sph.wav,and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that may be in the end the finest reward that we earn from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago and thank you very much now the saturn system is a rich planetary system it offers mystery scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach just studying the rings alone we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies and here 's a beautiful picture of the andromeda nebula which is our closest in the next eighteen minutes i'm going to take you on a journey and is really part of and is also a metaphor for a much larger human voyage to understand the inter connectiveness of everything around us and also how humans fit into that picture and it pains me that i can't tell you all that we have learned with cassini show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken in the last two and a half years because i simply don't have the time so i'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories that have emerged out of it's a journey that you and i have been on for many years now and it began some fifty years ago when humans first stepped off our planet and in those fifty years not only did we literally physically this major exploratory expedition that we are conducting around saturn and have been for the past two and a half years saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons they range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the us most of the beautiful pictures we've taken of saturn in fact show saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons here 's saturn with and then here 's saturn showing the rings edge on showing you just how vertically thin they are with the moon enceladus now two of the forty seven moons that saturn has are standouts and those are titan and enceladus titan is saturn 's largest moon and until cassini had arrived there was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain that we had remaining in our solar system and it is a body that has long intrigued people who 've watched the planets it has a very large thick atmosphere and in fact its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the earth or at least had in the past than any other body in the solar system its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen like you are breathing here in this room except that its atmosphere is suffused with simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane and these molecules high up in the atmosphere of titan get broken down and their products join together to make haze particles this haze is ubiquitous it's completely global and enveloping titan and that's why you cannot see down to the surface with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum but these haze particles it was surmised before we got there with cassini over billions and billions of years gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface in a thick organic sludge so like the equivalent the titan equivalent of tar or oil or what we didn't know what but this is what we suspected and these molecules especially methane and ethane can be it turns out that methane is to titan what water is to the earth it's a condensable in the atmosphere and so set foot on the moon but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets all eight of them and ok and above those clouds you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface the temperature at the surface is some three hundred and fifty degrees below zero fahrenheit but despite that cold you could have rain falling down on the surface of titan and doing on titan what rain does on the earth it carves gullies it forms rivers and cataracts it can create canyons it can pool in large basins and craters it can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills down into the lowlands so stop and think for a minute try to imagine what the surface of titan might look like it's dark high noon on titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the earth it's cold it's eerie it's misty it might be raining and you might be standing on the shores of lake michigan brimming with paint that is the view that we had of the surface of titan before we got there with cassini and i can tell you that what we have found on titan though it is not the same in detail is every bit as fascinating as that story is and for us it has been like for cassini people it has been like a jules verne adventure come true as i said it has a thick extensive atmosphere this is a picture of titan back lit by the sun with the rings as a beautiful backdrop and yet another moon there i don't even know which one it is it's a very extensive atmosphere we have instruments on cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere we have landed on asteroids we have rendezvoused with comets and at this point in time we have a spacecraft on its way to pluto the body formerly known as a planet and my camera system is one of them and we have taken pictures like this and what you see is bright and dark regions and that's about as far as it got for us it was so mystifying we couldn't make out what we were seeing on titan when you look closer at this region you start to see things like sinuous channels we didn't know you see a few round things this we later found out is in fact a crater but there's very few craters on the surface of titan meaning it's a very young surface and there are features that look tectonic they look like they've been pulled apart whenever you see anything linear on a planet it means there's been a fracture like a fault and so it's been tectonically altered but we couldn't make sense of our images until six months after we got into orbit an event occurred that many have regarded as the highlight of cassini's investigation of titan and that was the deployment of the huygens probe the european built huygens probe that cassini had carried for seven years across the solar system we deployed it to the atmosphere of titan it took two and a half hours to descend and it landed on the surface and i just want to emphasize how significant an event this is this is a device of human making and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history it is so significant that in my mind this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the us and europe and sadly that wasn't the case it was significant for another reason this is an international mission and this event was celebrated in europe in germany and the celebratory presentations were given in english accents and american accents and german accents and french and italian and dutch accents it was a moving demonstration of what the words united nations is supposed to mean a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good and in this case it was a massive undertaking and all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey a voyage to to explore a planet and to come to understand a planetary system that for all of human history had been unreachable and now humans had actually touched it so it was i mean i'm getting goose bumps just talking about it it was a tremendously emotional event and it's something that i will personally never forget and you probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down and it also took panoramic pictures and i can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of titan 's surface from the probe and this is what we saw and it was a shocker because it was everything we wanted those other pictures taken from orbit to be it was an unambiguous pattern a geological pattern it's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids and you can follow these channels and you can see how they all converge and they converge into this channel here which drains into this region you are looking at a shoreline was this a shoreline of fluids we didn't know but this is somewhat of a shoreline this picture is taken at sixteen kilometers this is the picture taken at eight kilometers ok again the shoreline okay now sixteen kilometers eight kilometers this is roughly understand something to get a sense of our cosmic place to understand something of our origins and how an airline altitude if you were going to take an airplane trip across the us you would be flying at these altitudes so this is the picture you would have at the window of titanian airlines as you fly across the surface of titan and then finally the probe came to rest on the surface and i'm going to show you ladies and gentlemen the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system and here is the horizon ok these are probably water ice pebbles yes and obviously it landed in one of these flat dark regions and it didn't sink out of sight so it wasn't fluid that we landed in what the probe came down in was basically the titan equivalent of a mud flat this is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane and it's probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of titan through these channels that we saw and has drained over billions of years to fill in low lying basins and that is what the huygens probe landed in but still there was no earth our planet and we living on it came to be and of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this in our images or even in the huygens images of any large open bodies of fluids where were they it got even more puzzling when we found dunes ok so this is our movie of the equatorial region of titan showing these dunes these are dunes that are one hundred meters tall this is the saharan desert of titan it's obviously a place which is very dry or you wouldn't get dunes so again it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid until finally we saw lakes in the polar regions and there is a lake scene in the south polar region of titan it's about the size of lake ontario and then only a week and a half ago we flew over the north pole of titan and found again we found feature here the size of the caspian sea so it seems that the liquids for some reason we don't understand or during at least this season are apparently at the poles of titan and i think you would agree that we have found titan is a remarkable mystical place it's exotic it's alien but yet strangely earth like and having earth like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the earth itself and so now we go onto enceladus is a small moon it's about a tenth the size of titan and you can see it here next to england just to show you the size this is not meant to be a threat and enceladus is very white it's very bright and its surface is obviously with fractures it is a very geologically active body but the motherlode of discoveries on was found at the south pole and we're looking at the south pole here where we found this system of fractures and they're a different color because they're a different composition they are coated and we have been to saturn before we visited saturn in the early nineteen eighties but our investigations of saturn these fractures are coated with organic materials moreover this whole entire region the south polar region has elevated temperatures it's the hottest place on the planet on the body that's as bizarre as finding that the antarctic on the earth is hotter than the tropics and then when we took additional pictures we discovered that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine icy particles extending hundreds of miles into space and when we color code this image to bring out the faint light levels we see that these jets feed a plume that in fact we see in other images goes thousands of miles into the space above enceladus my team and i have examined images like this and like this one and have thought about the other results from cassini and we have arrived at the conclusion that these jets may be erupting from pockets of liquid water under the surface of enceladus so we have possibly liquid water organic materials and excess heat in order words we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail have become far more in depth and detailed since the cassini spacecraft traveling across interplanetary space for seven years of modern day planetary exploration or in other words an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms and i don't think i need to tell you that the discovery of life elsewhere in our solar system whether it be on enceladus or elsewhere would have enormous cultural and scientific implications because if we could demonstrate genesis had occurred not once but twice independently in our solar system then that means by inference it has occurred a staggering number of times throughout the universe and its thirteen point seven billion year history right now earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life it is precious it is unique it is still so far the only home we've ever known and if any of you were alert and coherent during the nineteen sixties we'd forgive you if you a picture that no human eye has ever seen before it is a total eclipse of the sun seen from the other side of saturn and in this impossibly beautiful picture you see the main rings back lit by the sun you see the refracted image of the sun and you see this ring created in fact by the exhalations of enceladus but as if that weren't brilliant enough we can spot in this beautiful image sight of our own planet now there is something deeply moving about seeing ourselves from afar and capturing the sight of our little blue ocean planet in the skies of other worlds and that,1
91,CarolynPorco_2009U.sph.wav,flying closer and deeper into these jets into the denser regions of these jets so that now we have come away with some very precise compositional measurements and we have found that the organic compounds coming from this moon are in fact more complex than we previously reported while they're not amino acids we're now finding things like propane and benzene hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde and the tiny water crystals here now look for all the world like they are frozen droplets of salty water which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the jets come from so we are very encouraged by these results and we are much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this moon two years ago here at ted i reported that we had discovered at saturn with the cassini spacecraft an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small under the south pole an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms whether or not there are living organisms there of course is an entirely different matter and that will have to await the arrival back at when we might journey to the saturnine system and visit the enceladus interplanetary geyser park just because we can moon enceladus seen here this region seen here for the first time in the cassini image taken in two thousand and five this is the south polar region with the famous tiger stripe fractures crossing the south pole and seen just recently in late two thousand and eight here is that region again now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere is experiencing the onset of august and eventually winter and i also reported that we'd made this mind blowing discovery this once in a lifetime discovery of towering jets erupting from those fractures at the south pole and at that time two years ago i mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface but we weren't really sure however the implications of those results of a possible environment within this moon that could support prebiotic chemistry and perhaps life itself were so exciting that in the intervening two years we have focused more on enceladus we've flown the cassini spacecraft by this moon now several times,1
92,CarolynSteel_2009G.sph.wav,and given that it takes three times as much grain actually ten times as much grain to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first that's not a very efficient way feeding us an it's an escalating problem too by two thousand and fifty it's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy rising hand in hand and that's going to pose an enormous problem six billion hungry carnivores to feed by that's a big problem and actually if we carry on as we are it's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to we're very hungry for fossil fuels too it takes about ten calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the west feed a city it's one of the great questions of our time yet it's one that's rarely asked we take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant and even though there is food that we are producing at great cost we don't actually value it half the food produced in the usa is currently thrown away even managing to feed the planet properly a billion of us are obese while a further billion none of it makes very much sense and when you think that eighty percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations it's a grim picture into cities the world is also embracing a western diet and if we look to the future it's an unsustainable diet so how did we get here and more importantly what are we going to do about it well to answer the slightly easier question first about ten thousand years ago i would say is the beginning of this process in the ancient near east known as the fertile crescent because as you can see it was crescent shaped and it was also fertile and it was here about ten thousand years ago that two extraordinary inventions agriculture and urbanism happened roughly in the same place and at the same time this is no accident because agriculture and cities are bound together they need each other and if we look at what those settlements were like we see they were compact they were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one that were in fact effectively spiritualized centralized food distribution centers because it was the temples that organized the harvest gathered in the grain offered it to the gods and then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people or indeed into this theater 's foyer in about an hour 's time there is going to be food there waiting for us having magically come from somewhere but when you think that every day for a city the size of london enough food has to if you like the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them and in fact that's true of every ancient city but of course not all of them were that small and famously rome had about a million citizens by the first century a d so how did a city like this feed itself answer is what i call ancient food miles basically rome had access to the sea which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away this is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world because it was very difficult to transport food over roads which were rough and the food obviously went off very quickly so rome effectively waged war on places like carthage and egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves in fact you could say that the expansion of the empire was really sort of one long drawn out militarized shopping spree have to mention this rome in fact at one stage i think that's extraordinary so rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite but the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre industrial world if we look at a map of london in the seventeenth century we can see that its grain which is coming in from the thames along the bottom of this map so the grain markets were to the south of the city and the roads leading up from them to cheapside which was the main market grain markets and if you look at the name of one of those streets bread street you can tell what was going on there three hundred years the same of course was true for fish fish was of course coming in by river as well same thing and of course billingsgate famously was london's fish market operating on site here until the mid nineteen eighties which is extraordinary really when you think about it this is another thing about food in cities once its roots into the city are established they very rarely move meat is a very different story because of course animals could walk into the city so much of london's meat was coming from the northwest from scotland and wales so it was coming in produced transported bought and sold cooked and arriving at the city at the northwest which is why smithfield london's very famous meat market was located up there poultry was coming in from east anglia and so on to the northeast i feel a bit like a weather woman and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes and then when they hit the eastern end of cheapside sold which is why it's called poultry and in fact if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age you can trace food coming in to it you can actually see how it was physically shaped by food both by reading the names of the streets which give you a lot of clues friday street in a previous life is where you went to buy your fish on a friday but also you have to imagine it full of food because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought earlier so this was obviously an organic city part of an organic cycle and that something similar has to happen every day for every city on earth it's remarkable that cities all of a sudden these animals are no longer walking into market they're being slaughtered out of sight and mind somewhere in the countryside and they're coming into the city by rail and this changes everything to start off with it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities really any size and shape in any place cities used to be constrained by geography they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means all of the sudden they are effectively emancipated from and as you can see from these maps of london in the ninety years after the trains came it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot and so on to a large splurge that would be very very difficult to feed with anybody on foot either animals or people and of course that was just the beginning after the trains came cars and really this marks the end of this process it's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all and this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell devoid of mess certainly devoid of people because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape in fact what they did to get food was they got in their cars we live in places like this as if they're the most natural things in the world forgetting that because we're animals and that we need to eat we're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient to a box somewhere on the outskirts came back with a week 's worth of shopping and wondered what on earth to do with it and this really is the moment when our relationship both with food and cities changes completely here we have food that used to be the center the social core of the city at the periphery it used to be a social event buying and selling food now it's anonymous we used to cook now we just add water a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something we don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat we just read the back of a label on a packet and we don't value food we don't trust it so instead of trusting it we fear it and instead of valuing it we throw it away one of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they've made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder by making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place they've actually distanced us from our most important relationship which is that of us and nature it's not a new question five hundred years ago it's what thomas more was asking himself this is the frontispiece of his book utopia and it was a series of semi independent city states if that sounds remotely familiar a day 's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming and grew vegetables in their back gardens and ate communal meals together and so on and i think you could argue that food is a fundamental it even got built but nothing to do with this vision that howard had and that is the problem with these utopian ideas that they are utopian utopia was actually a word that thomas moore used deliberately it was a kind of got a double derivation from the greek it can either mean a good place or no place because it's an ideal it's an imaginary thing we can't have it and i think as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling were and as more of us move into cities more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me it's soybean fields in mata grosso in brazil in that makes it not much use so i've come up with an alternative which is sitopia from the ancient greek sitos for food and topos for place i believe we already live in sitopia we live in a world shaped by food and if we realize that we can use food as a really powerful tool a conceptual tool design tool to shape the world differently so if we were to do that what might sitopia look like i think it looks a bit like this i have to use this slide it's just the look on the face of the dog but anyway this is it's food at the center of life at the center of family life being celebrated being enjoyed people taking time for it this is where food should be in our society but you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this by the way these can be men as well of the social life of the city because without that you can't have this kind of place food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape and is not just a and this is a community project i visited recently in toronto it's a greenhouse where kids get told all about food and growing their own food here is a plant called kevin or maybe it's so sitopia for me is really way of seeing it's basically recognizing that sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere the trick is to join them up to use food as a way of and if we do that we're going to stop seeing cities as big metropolitan unproductive blobs like this we're going to see them more like this as part of the these are extraordinary landscapes but few of us ever get to see them and increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding which is why i think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing it's a reconceptualization of the way food shapes our the best image i know of this is from six hundred and fifty years ago it's ambrogio lorenzetti 's allegory of good government it's about the relationship between the city and the and i think the message of this is very clear if the city looks after the country the country will look after the city and i want us to ask now what would ambrogio lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today what would an allegory of good government look like today i think it's an urgent question it's one we have to ask and we have to start answering we know we are what we eat we need to realize that the world is also what we eat but if we take that idea we can use food as a really powerful tool to shape the world better thank you very much as more of us move into cities more of us are eating meat so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals,1
93,CarterEmmart_2010.sph.wav,nasa supported this work twelve years ago as part of the rebuilding of the hayden planetarium so that we would share this with the world the digital universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do our main space shows in the dome but what you see here is the result of actually internships that we hosted with linkoping university in sweden i've had twelve students work on this for their graduate work and the result has been this software called uniview and a company called sciss in sweden this software allows interactive use so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called earth matters on the lower east side of manhattan where i live and it was done as a collaborative project with the rubin museum of for an exhibit on comparative cosmology and so as we move out we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of galaxies as we see here light travel time giving you a sense of how far away we are the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long we're backing up into the past we so far up we're finally seeing a containment around us the afterglow of the big bang this is the see we'll fly outside it here just to see this sort of containment if we were outside this it would almost be meaningless in the sense as before time but this our containment of the visible universe we know the universe is bigger than that which we can see coming back quickly we see here the radiosphere that we jumped out of in the beginning but these are positions the latest positions of exoplanets that we've mapped and our sun here obviously with our own solar system what you're going to see you're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down orbit of the moon and we see the can be updated and we can add in new data i know doctor carolyn porco is the camera p i for the cassini mission but here we see the complex trajectory of the cassini mission color coded for different mission phases this software allows us to come close and look at parts of this this software can also be networked between domes we have a growing user base of this and we network domes and we can network between domes and classrooms we're actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub saharan planetarium in as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in columbia and a high school in cambodia and the cambodians have actually controlled the hayden planetarium from their high school this is an image from saturday photographed by the aqua satellite but through the uniview software and so you're seeing the edge of the earth this is nepal this is in fact right here is the valley of lhasa here in tibet we can see the haze from fires and so forth in the ganges valley down below in india this is nepal and tibet the flat horizon that we've evolved with has been a metaphor for the infinite unbounded resources and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste to say this beautiful world that we live on bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave in coming out so i'd like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is because our home is the universe and we are the universe essentially we carry that in us and to be able to see our it wasn't until we really left earth got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself the digital universe atlas has been built at the american museum of natural history over the past twelve years we maintain that put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales what we see here are satellites around the earth and the earth in proper registration against the universe as we see,1
94,CaryFowler_2009G.sph.wav,you see apples that are red yellow and green and that's about it so let me show you a picture of one form of diversity here 's some beans and are about thirty five or forty different varieties of beans on this picture now imagine each one of these varieties as being distinct from another about the same way as a poodle as a great dane if i wanted to show you a picture of all the dog breeds in the world and i put thirty or forty of them on a slide it would take about ten slides because there about four hundred breeds of dogs in the world but there are thirty five to forty thousand different varieties of beans so if i were to going to show you all the beans in the world and i had a slide like this and i switched it every second it would take up my entire ted talk and i wouldn't have to say anything i've been fascinated with crop diversity for about thirty five years from now ever since i stumbled across a fairly obscure academic article by a guy named jack harlan but the interesting thing is that this diversity and the tragic thing is that this diversity is being lost we have about two hundred thousand different varieties of wheat and we have about two to four hundred thousand different varieties of rice but it's being lost and i want to give you an example of that it's a bit of a personal example in fact in the united states in the eighteen hundreds that's where we have the best farmers and gardeners were growing seven thousand one hundred named varieties of apples imagine that seven thousand one hundred apples with names today six thousand eight hundred of those are extinct no longer to be seen again and at the end of the speech i would ask how many people have found a name and i never had fewer than two thirds of an audience hold up their hand and i said you know what these apples come from your ancestors and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them they gave them their name the bad news is they're extinct the good news is a third of you didn't hold up your hand your apple 's still out there find it make sure it doesn't join the list so i want to tell you that the piece of the good news is that the fowler apple is still out there and he described the diversity within crops all the different kinds of wheat and rice and such as a genetic resource the fowler apple is described in here i hope this doesn't surprise you as a beautiful i don't know if we named the apple of or the apple named us to be honest the description goes on and it says that it doesn 't rank high in quality however and then he has to go even further it sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of as grown in new york the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size and quality and is on the whole and i guess there's a lesson to be learned here and the lesson is so why save it i get this question all the time why don't we just save the best one and there are a couple of answers to that question one thing is that there is no such thing as a best one today 's best variety is tomorrow 's lunch for insects or pests or disease and he said this genetic resource and i'll never forget the words stands between us and catastrophic starvation on a scale we cannot imagine the other thing is that maybe that fowler apple or maybe a variety of wheat that's not economical right now has disease or pest resistance or some quality that we're going to need for climate change that the others don 't so it's not necessary why as a raw material as a trait we can use in the future think of diversity as options and options of course are exactly what we need an era of climate change and university of washington to ask the question what's going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change and what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops to be able to adapt to this in short the answer is that in the future in many countries the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter than anything those crops have seen in the past the coldest growing seasons of the future hotter than the hottest of the past agriculture adapted to that i don't know can fish play the piano if agriculture hasn't experienced that how could it be adapted now the highest concentration of poor and hungry people in the world and the place where climate change ironically is going to be the worst is in south asia and sub sahara africa so i've picked two examples here and i want to show you i figured he was really on to something or he was one of these academic nutcases so i looked a little further and what i figured out was that he wasn't a nutcase he was the most respected scientist in the field in the histogram before you now the blue bars represent the historical range of temperatures going back far as we have temperature data and you can see that there's some difference between one growing season and another some are colder some are hotter and it's a bell shaped curve the tallest bar is the average temperature for the most number of growing seasons in the future later this century it's going totally out of bounds the agricultural system and more importantly the crops in the field in india have never experienced this before thirty if the maize or corn varieties which is the dominant crop fifty percent of the in southern africa are still in the field thirty percent decrease of production in the context of increasing population that's a food crises it's global in nature we will watch children starve to death on tv now you may say that twenty years is a long way off it's two breeding cycles for maize we have two rolls of the dice to get this right we have to get climate ready crops in the field and we have to do that rather quickly now the good news is that we have conserved we have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity agricultural diversity mostly in the form of seed and we put it in seed banks which is a fancy way of saying a freezer if you want to conserve seed for a long term and you want to make it available to plant breeders and researchers you dry it and then you freeze in rwanda in the solomon islands and then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures and all kinds of things and every time something like this happens what he understood was that biological diversity crop diversity is the biological foundation of agriculture it means extinction we lose diversity and i'm not talking about losing diversity in the same way that you lose your car keys i'm talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs actually losing it never to be seen again so a number of us got together and decided that you know enough is enough and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility that can really offer protection for our biological diversity maybe not the most charismatic diversity you don't look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do a panda bear but it's very important diversity so we needed a really safe place and we went quite far north to find it to svalbard in fact this is above mainland norway you can see greenland there that's at seventy eight degrees north it's as far as you can fly on a regularly scheduled airplane it's a remarkably beautiful landscape i can't even begin to describe it to you it's otherworldly beautiful we worked with the norwegian government and with which is built in a mountain in svalbard the idea of svalbard was that it's cold so we get natural freezing temperatures it's remote it's remote and accessible so it's safe and we don't depend on mechanical refrigeration this is more than just an artist 's dream it's now a reality it's the raw material the stuff of evolution in our agricultural crops not a trivial matter and this next picture shows it in context in svalbard and here 's the front door of this facility when you open up the front door this is what you're looking at it's pretty simple it's a hole in the ground it's a tunnel and you go into the tunnel chiseled in solid rock about one hundred and thirty meters there are now a couple of security doors so you won 't see it quite like this again when you get to the back you get into an area that's really my favorite why is that i think of it as sort of a cathedral and i know that this tags me as a bit of a nerd but some the happiest days of my life have been spent if you were to walk into one of these rooms you would see this it's not very exciting but if you know what's there it's pretty emotional and he also understood that that foundation was crumbling literally crumbling that indeed a mass extinction was underway we have now about four hundred and twenty five thousand samples of unique crop varieties there's seventy thousand samples of different varieties of rice in this facility right now about a year from now we'll have over half a million samples we're going up to over a million and someday we'll basically have samples about five hundred seeds of every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state in this facility this is a backup system for world agriculture it's a backup system for all the seed banks storage is free it operates like a safety deposit box norway owns the mountain and the facility but the this particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the united states of canada and an international institution from syria i think it's interesting in that this facility i think is almost the only thing i can think of these days where countries literally every country in the world because we have seeds from every country in the world all the countries of the world have gotten together to do something that's both long term the water crisis agriculture takes seventy percent of fresh water supplies on earth i can't look you in the eyes and tell you that there is such a solution for those things or the energy crisis or world hunger in our fields in our agricultural system and that this mass extinction was taking place with very few people noticing and even fewer caring or peace in conflict i can't i look you in the eyes and tell you that i have a simple solution for that but i can look you in the and tell you that we can't solve any of those problems if we don't have crop diversity because i challenge you to think of an effective efficient sustainable solution to climate change if we don't have crop diversity because quite literally if agriculture doesn't adapt to climate change neither will we and if crops don't adapt to climate change neither will agriculture neither will we so this is not something pretty and nice to do there are a lot of people who would love to have this diversity exist just for the existence value of it it is i agree a nice thing to do but it's a necessary thing to do so in a very really sense i believe we as an international community should get organized to complete the task the svalbard global seed vault is a wonderful gift that norway and others have given us but it's not the complete answer we need to collect the remaining diversity that's out there we need to put it into good seed banks that can offer those seeds to researchers in the future we need to catalog it it's a library of life but right now i would say we don't have a card catalog for it and we need to support it financially my big idea would be that while we think of it as commonplace to endow an art museum or endow a chair at a university we really ought to be thinking about endowing wheat thirty million dollars in an endowment would take care of preserving all the diversity in wheat forever so we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms and my final thought is that we of course by conserving wheat rice potatoes and the other crops we may quite simply end up saving ourselves thank you now i know that many of you don't stop to think about diversity in agricultural systems and let 's face it that's logical you don't see it in the newspaper every day and when you go into the supermarket you certainly don't see a lot of choices there,1
95,CatherineMohr_2009.sph.wav,so with the combination of these technologies we can reach it all and we can see it all we can heal the disease and we can leave the patient whole and intact and functional afterwards i've talked about the patient as if the patient is somehow someone abstract outside this room and that is not the case many of you all of you maybe will at some point or have already faced a diagnosis of cancer or heart disease or some organ disfuction that's going to buy you a date with a surgeon and when you get to that point these maladies don't care how many books you've written how many companies you've started that nobel prize you have yet to win how much time you planned to spend with your children these maladies come for us all and the prospect i'm offering you of an easier surgery is that going to make that diagnosis any less terrifying i'm not sure i really even want it to because facing your own mortality causes a re evaluation of priorities and a realignment of what your goals are in life unlike anything else and i would never want to deprive you of that epiphany what i want instead is for you to be whole five to ten thousand years now imagine this you are a healer in a stone age village and you have some guy that you're not quite sure what's wrong with him oliver sacks is going to be born way in the future intact and functional enough to go out and save the world he 's got some seizure disorder and you don't understand this but you think to yourself i 'm not quite sure what's wrong with this guy but maybe if i cut a hole in his head i can fix it now that is surgical thinking now we've got the dawn of interventional surgery here what is astonishing about this is even though we don't know really how much of this was intended to be and so what we are seeing is evidence of a refined technique that was being handed down over thousands and thousands of years talk about surgical robots is also a talk about surgery and while i've tried to make my images not too graphic keep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood than normal people do all over the world this arose independently at sites everywhere that had no communication to one another we really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery now we can fast forward many thousands of years into the bronze age and beyond and we see new refined tools coming out but surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative than their bold trephanating ancestors these guys confined their surgery to fairly superficial injuries and surgeons were tradesmen rather than physicians this persisted all the way into and through the renaissance that may have saved the writers but it didn't really save the surgeons terribly much they were still a mistrusted lot surgeons still had a bit of a pr problem because we were in the age before anesthesia the agony of the patient is really as much of the public spectacle as the surgery itself one of the most famous of these guys frere jacques shown here doing a lithotomy the removal of the bladder stone one of the most invasive surgeries they did at the time had to take less than two minutes you had to have quite a flare for the dramatic and be really really quick and so here you see him doing a lithotomy and he is credited with doing over four thousand of these public surgeries wandering around in europe which is an astonishing number when you think that surgery must have been a last resort i mean who would put themselves through that until anesthesia the absence of sensation this was truly a revolution in surgery but there was a pretty big problem with this after these very long painstaking operations attempting to cure things they'd never been able to touch before because after all what a surgeon does to a patient if it were done without consent would be a felony the patients died they died of massive infection surgery didn't hurt anymore but it killed you pretty quickly and infection would continue to claim a majority of surgical patients until the next big revolution in surgery which was the aseptic technique joseph lister was asepis 's or sterility 's biggest advocate to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons and they said they had learned it was as important to wash your hands before doing surgery as it was to wash up afterwards with the patient insensitive to pain and a sterile operating field all bets were off the sky was the limit you could now start doing surgery the gut on the liver on the heart on the brain transplantation you could take an organ out of one person you could put it in another person and it would surgeons didn't have a problem with respectability anymore they had become gods the era of the big surgeon big incision had arrived surgeons are the tailors the plumbers the carpenters some would say the butchers of the medical world but at quite a cost because they are saving lives but not necessarily quality of life because healthy people don't usually need surgery and unhealthy people have a very hard time recovering from a cut like that the question had to be asked well can we do these same surgeries but through little incisions laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery surgery with long instruments through small incisions and it really changed the landscape of surgery some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique until the nineteen eighties when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that that allowed this to be done for real operations so what you see this is now the first surgical image as we're coming down the tube this is a new entry into the body it looks very different from what you're expecting surgery to look like we bring instruments in from two separate cuts in the side and then you can start manipulating tissue within ten years of the first gallbladder surgeries being done cutting reshaping reforming bypassing fixing but you need to talk about a majority of gallbladder surgeries were being done laparoscopically truly pretty big revolution but there were casualties of this revolution these techniques were a lot harder to learn than people had anticipated the learning curve was very long and during that learning curve the complications went quite a bit higher surgeons had to give up their three d vision they had to give up their wrists they had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments has over three thousand hours of laparoscopic experience now this is a particularly frustrating placement of the needle but this is hard and one of the reasons why it is so hard is because the external ergonomics are terrible you've got these long instruments and you're working off your center line and the instruments are essentially working backwards so what you need to do to take the capability of your hand and put it on the other side of that small incision is you need to put a on that instrument and so i get to talk about robots the da vinci robot put just that wrist on the other side of that and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a trajectory and the reason why this becomes so much easier is you can see the bottom the hands are making the motions and the instruments are following those motions exactly now what you put between those instruments and those hands is a large fairly complicated robot the surgeon is sitting at a console and which is a prostate deep in the pelvis and it requires fine dissection and some kind of a perspective of where we are right now with surgical robots and where we're going to be going in the future i want to give you a little bit of perspective of how we got to this point without cracking the chest this is all done in between the ribs and you can go inside the heart itself and repair the valves from the inside you've got these technologies i talked about the large complicated robot with all its bells and whistles one of those robots will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon but there are other barriers so something like a prostatectomy the prostate is small and it's in one spot and you can set your robot up very precisely to work in that one spot but if you need to reach more places than just one you need to move the robot and you need to put some new incisions in there and you need to re set it up and you need to add some more ports and more and the problem is it gets time consuming and cumbersome and for that reason there are many surgeries that just aren't being done with the da vinci so we had to ask the question well how do we fix that what if we could change it so that we didn't have to re set up each time we wanted to move somewhere different what if we could bring all the instruments in together in one place how would that change the capabilities of the surgeon and how would that change the experience for the patient now to do that we need to be able to bring a camera how we even came to believe that surgery was ok that this was something that was possible to do that this kind of cutting and reforming was ok so a little bit of perspective and instruments in together through one small tube like that tube you saw in the laparoscopy video or not so coincidentally like a tube like this so what's going to come out of that tube is the debut of this new technology this new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere so here it comes this is the camera it has to be able to come off of the center line and then be able to work back toward that center line he 's a cheeky little devil but it's worth it for the freedom that this gives us as we're going around for the patient however it's transparent this is all they're going to see it's very exciting to think where we get to go with this we get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery as we take these capabilities and we get to go to the next places we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be and i think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution we need to not just take our hands in in new ways we also need to take our eyes in in new ways we need to see beyond the surface we need to be able to guide what we're cutting in a much better way this is a cancer surgery one of the problems with this even for surgeons who 've been looking at this a lot is you can't see the cancer especially when it's hidden below the surface about ten thousand years of perspective this is a trephanated skull go bind to the cancer and we can make those markers glow and we can take special cameras and we can look at it now we know where we need to cut even when it's below the surface we can take these markers and we can inject them in a tumor site we can inject these dyes into the bloodstream so that when we sew on a new vessel and we bypass a blockage on the heart we can see if we actually made the connection before we close that patient back up again something that we haven't been able to do without radiation before we can light and we don't even need to confine ourselves to this macro vision we have flexible microscopic probes that we can bring down into the body and we can look at cells directly i'm looking at nerves here so these are nerves you see down on the bottom and the microscope probe that's being held by the robotic hand up at the top so this is all very prototypey at this point but you care about nerves if you are a surgical patient because they let you keep continence bladder control and sexual function after surgery all of which is generally fairly important to the patient,1
96,CatherineMohr_2010U.sph.wav,let 's go to a sponge i wipe it with a sponge and i put it under the running water and i have a lot less energy and a lot more water unless you're like me and you leave the handle in the position of hot even when you turn it on and then you start to use more energy or worse you let it run until it's warm to rinse out your towel and now all bets are off so what this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect the position in which you put the handle have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimize now imagine someone as twisted as me trying to build a house my husband and i are doing right now and so we wanted to know how green could we be and there's a thousand and one articles out there telling us how to make all these green trade offs and they are just as suspect in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges and missing the elephant in the living now the average house has about three hundred megawatt hours of embodied energy in it this is the energy it takes to make it millions and millions of paper towels we wanted to know how much better we could do first of all i'm a geek i'm an organic food eating carbon footprint minimizing robotic surgery geek and i really want to build and so like many people we start with a house on a lot and i'm going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we're doing on the bottom so first we demolish it it takes some energy but if you deconstruct it you take it all apart you use the bits you can get some of that energy back we then dug a big hole to put in a rainwater catchment tank to take our yard water independent and then we poured a big foundation for passive solar now you can reduce the embodied energy by about twenty five percent by using high fly ash concrete we then put in framing and so this is framing lumber composite materials and it's kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that but it can be a sustainable resource if you use f s c certified lumber we then go on to the first thing that was very surprising if we put aluminum windows in this house we would double the energy use right there now pvc is a little bit better but still not as good as the wood that we chose we then put in plumbing electrical and hvac and insulate now spray foam is an excellent insulator it fills in all the cracks but it is pretty high embodied energy and sprayed in cellulose or blue jeans is a much lower energy alternative to that we also used straw bale in fill for our library which has zero embodied energy when it comes time to sheetrock if you use ecorock it's about a quarter of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock but i'm very suspicious of all of these well meaning articles people long on moral authority and short on data telling me how to do these kinds of things and so i have to figure this out for myself for example is this so now we add in the final construction energy we add it all up and we've built a house for less than half of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this but before we pat ourselves too much on the back we have poured one hundred and fifty one megawatt hours of energy into constructing this house when there was a house there before and so the question is how could we make that back and so if i run my new energy efficient house forward compared with the old non energy efficient house we make it back in about six years now i probably would have upgraded the old house to be more energy efficient and in that case it would take me more about twenty years to break even now if i hadn't paid attention to embodied energy it would have taken us over fifty years to break even compared to the upgraded house so what does this mean on the scale of my portion of the house this is equivalent to about as much as i drive in a year it's about five times as much as if i went entirely vegetarian but my elephant in the living room flies clearly i need to walk home from ted but all the calculations for embodied energy are on the blog and remember it's sometimes the things that you are not expecting to be the biggest changes that are thank you i have dropped a blob of organic yogurt from happy self actualized local cows on my counter top and i grab a paper towel the answer to this can be found in embodied energy this is the amount of energy that goes into any paper towel or embodied water and every time i use a paper towel i am using this much virtual energy and water wipe it up throw it away now if i compare that to a cotton towel that i can use a thousand times i don't have a whole lot of embodied energy until i wash that yogurty towel this is now operating energy so if i throw my towel in the washing machine now put energy and water back into that towel unless i use a front loading high efficiency washing machine and then it looks but what about a recycled paper towel that comes in those little half sheets well now a paper towel looks better screw the paper towels,1
97,CharityTillemannDick_2010P.sph.wav,she was absolutely emphatic i was singing my own obituary i was very limited by my condition physically limited when i sang and as air came up from my lungs through my vocal cords and passed my lips as sound it was the closest thing i had ever come to transcendence and just because of someone 's hunch i wasn't going to give it up thankfully i met who is dry as toast but he and his team at johns hopkins didn't just want me to survive they wanted me to live a meaningful life this meant making trade offs i come from colorado it's a mile high and i grew up there with my ten brothers and sisters and two adoring parents well the altitude exacerbated my symptoms so i moved to baltimore to be near my doctors and enrolled in conservatory nearby may know this but you are celebrating an anniversary with me i'm not i couldn't walk as much as i used to so i opted for five inch heels and i gave up salt i went vegan and i started taking huge doses also known as viagra my father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for ph i had a heart catheterization where they measure this internal arterial pulmonary pressure which is supposed to be between fifteen and twenty was one hundred and forty six i like to do things big and it meant one there is a big gun treatment for pulmonary hypertension called flolan and it's not just a it's a way of life doctors insert a catheter in your chest which is attached to a pump that weighs about four and a half pounds one year ago today i woke up from a month long coma following a double lung transplant crazy i every day twenty four hours that pump is at your side administering medicine directly to your heart and it's not a particularly like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich you'll probably end up in the icu if you go through a metal detector you'll probably die if you a bubble in your medicine because you have to mix it every morning and it stays in there you probably die if you run out of medicine you definitely die no one wants to go on flolan but when i it was a godsend within a few days i could walk again within a few weeks i was performing and in a few months i debuted at the kennedy center the was a little bit problematic when performing so i'd attach it to my inner thigh with the help of the girdle and hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my spanx hoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly and the tubing coming out of my chest was a nightmare for costume designers i graduated from graduate school in two thousand and six and i got a fellowship to go back to europe a few days after arriving i met this wonderful old conductor who started casting me in all of these roles and before long i was commuting between budapest milan and florence this ugly unwanted high maintenance mechanical pet my life was kind of like the happy part in an opera very complicated but in a good then in february of two thousand and eight my grandfather passed away he was a big figure in all of our lives and we loved him very much it certainly didn't prepare me for what came next seven weeks later i got a call from my family my father had been in a catastrophic car accident and he died at twenty four my death would have been entirely expected but his well the only way i can articulate how it felt was that it precipitated my medical decline against my but soon i was showing signs of right heart failure and i had to return to sea level doing so knowing that i probably would never see my home again six years before that i was starting my career as an opera singer in europe when i was diagnosed idiopathic pulmonary hypertension also known as i canceled most of my engagements that summer but i had one left in tel aviv so i went after one performance i could barely drag myself from the stage to the taxicab i sat down and felt the blood rush down from my face and in the heat of the desert i was freezing cold my fingers started turning blue and i was like what is going on here i heard my heart 's valves snapping that stuff up fast i would never leave that apartment alive i started mixing and i felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole but i just kept on going finally with the last bottle in and the last bubble out i attached the pump to the tubing and lay it would kick in soon enough if it didn 't i'd probably see my father sooner than i anticipated which is a side effect of the medication and i knew i'd be okay we're not big on fear in my family but i was scared went back to the states anticipating i'd return to europe but the heart catheterization showed that i wasn't going anywhere farther that a flight for life from johns hopkins hospital i performed here and there but as my condition deteriorated so did my voice months after having very challenging surgeries i knew another young man though who had ph who died while waiting for one i wanted to live i thought stem cells were a good option but they hadn't developed to a point where i could take advantage of them yet i officially took a break from singing and i went to the cleveland clinic to be reevaluated for the third time in five years for transplant it happens when there's a thickening in the pulmonary veins making the right side of the heart work overtime is a healthy patient it was like in one verbal swoop he had channeled my on life and medicine and confucius i still didn't want a transplant but in a month i was back in the hospital with some severely edemic kankles very attractive and it was right heart failure i finally it was time to take my doctor 's advice it was time for me to go to cleveland and to start the agonizing wait i was still in the hospital i got a telephone call it was my doctor in cleveland marie and they had lungs it was a match they were from texas and everybody was really happy for me but me because despite their problems i and causing what i call the reverse grinch effect my heart was three and a half sizes too big there in hopes that they would meet me and say what we knew might be our final goodbye but organs don't wait and i went into surgery before i could say goodbye the last thing i remember was lying on a white blanket telling my surgeon that i needed to see my mother again and to please try and save my voice fell into this apocalyptic dreamworld during the thirteen and a half hour surgery i flatlined twice forty quarts of blood were infused into my body and in my surgeon 's twenty year career he said it was among the most difficult that he 's ever performed they left my chest open for two weeks you could see my over sized heart beating inside of it i was on a dozen machines that were keeping my alive an infection ravaged my skin i had hoped my voice would be saved but my doctors knew that the breathing tubes going down my throat might have already destroyed it if they stayed in there was no way i would ever sing again so my doctor got the ent the top guy at the clinic to come down and give me surgery to move the tubes around my voice box he said it would kill me so my own surgeon performed the procedure in a last ditch attempt to save my voice though my mom couldn't say goodbye to me before the surgery she didn't leave my side package it is her one year ago to this very day i woke up ninety five lbs there were a dozen tubes coming in and out of my body i couldn't walk i couldn't talk i couldn't eat i couldn't move i certainly couldn't sing i couldn't even breathe when i looked up and i saw my mother i couldn't help whether by a mack truck or by heart failure or faulty lungs death happens but life isn't really just about avoiding death is it it's about living i went to see this specialist and she was top of the field and told me i had to stop singing she said those high notes are going to kill you and i'm so grateful they did this past summer when i was running and singing and dancing and playing with my nieces that i couldn't sing and i wanted to tell her and i want to tell you we to stop letting disease divorce us from our dreams when we do we will find that patients don't just survive we thrive and some of us might even sing have any medical evidence to back up her claim that there was a relationship between operatic arias and pulmonary hypertension,1
98,CharlesAnderson_2009I.sph.wav,it works is it comes from the southwest it comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards india so it comes from the southwest it's a southwest monsoon picks up moisture as it crosses the ocean that's what brings the monsoon rain and then in the winter things cool down high pressure builds over india and the whole system goes into reverse so the wind is now coming from the northeast out of india across the indian ocean this way towards africa keep that in mind now i'm a marine biologist but i'm actually a bit of an old fashioned naturalist i suppose i'm interested in all sorts of things almost everything that moves including and i'm actually going to talk this afternoon about dragonflies this is a very beautiful species it's called the oriental scarlet and one thing you need to know about dragonflies one important thing is that they lay their eggs in fresh water they need fresh water to breed they lay the eggs into fresh water little larvae hatch out in fresh water they feed on other little things they feed on mosquito larvae so they're very important is a lot of variation but if you have a dragonfly with say a one year life cycle which is quite typical the larva living in the fresh water lives for ten or eleven months adult which comes after lives for one or two months so it's essentially a freshwater animal it really does need fresh water or wandering glider and as the name might suggest it is found pretty much around the world it lives throughout the tropics the americas africa asia australia into the pacific and it wanders far and wide we know that much about it but it really hasn't been studied very much it's a rather mediocre it seems a bit dull you know it's sort of dull colored and it's fairly common and it occurs everywhere you know why bother but on diving spent as much of my time as i could in and under the water didn't notice any dragonflies maybe they were there maybe they weren 't didn't notice them but after some time after some months one day as i was going out and about suddenly i noticed hundreds of dragonflies hundreds of dragonflies something like this these are all this species globe skimmer i didn't know at the time but i know now they're globe skimmers i was a bit slow i didn't really take too much notice but i asked some maldivian friends and colleagues and yes they come every year and i asked people about them and yes they knew but they didn't know anything where they came from or anything and again i didn't think too much of it i live actually sitting here today in mysore we're closer to mala than we are to delhi for example but slowly it began to dawn on me that something rather special was happening because dragonflies need fresh water to breed it's built entirely of coral reefs and on top of the coral reefs are sand banks average height about that much above sea level so global warming sea level rise it's a real serious issue under the soil the trees can put their roots into it humans can dig holes and make a well but bit tricky there is no surface fresh water there are no ponds streams rivers lakes nothing like that so why is it that every year millions of dragonflies millions millions of if you're in it india obviously is the place to be at the moment but if you're a marine biologist maldives is not such a bad place to be and it has been my home these those of you who are indian or spent your childhood here let me have a show of hands who of you not yet not yet you're too keen you're too keen no hang on hang on wait for the those of you who grew up in india do you remember in your childhood dragonflies swarms of dragonflies maybe at school maybe tying little bits of string onto them maybe pulling bits off i'm not asking about that south asia including the maldives and i got a bit curious about it in the maldives now in india there is plenty of water so dragonflies yeah of course why not still in southwest monsoon maldives is still in the southwest monsoon but wind is invariably every time is from the west it's going towards india not from india so are these things how are these things getting here are they coming from india against the wind seemed a bit unlikely so and pretty soon a picture started emerging in bangalore a colleague there sent me information for three years average twenty fourth of september so late september time of year this is when they first arrive but how long are they around for does that give any clues so i started a very rigorous scientific process i had a rigorous scientific transect i got on my bicycle and i cycled around the island of mala it's about five kilometers around counting the dragonflies as i go trying not to bump into people as i'm looking in the trees and here for a very short time october november december that's it and then they tail off there's a few but that's it october november december that is not the northeast monsoon season that's not the southwest season that's the inter monsoon the time when the monsoon changes now what i said was you get the southwest monsoon going one way and then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way and that front in the middle is not vertical it's at an angle so as it comes over towards mala i'm standing in mala underneath the front i can be in the southwest monsoon but the wind above is from the northeast so the dragonflies are actually coming from india on the northeast monsoon but at an altitude at one thousand to two thousand meters up in the air incredible these little insects it's the same ones we see out here two inches long five centimeters long flying in their millions four hundred miles across the ocean at two thousand meters up quite incredible so i was quite pleased with myself i thought wow i've tracked this one i know how they come here i know how they come here but why do they come here what are millions of dragonflies doing flying out over the ocean every year all the way across to east africa i know that because i have friends who work on fisheries research vessels who have sent to me reports from boats out in the ocean i know because we have reports from seychelles which fit in as well down here and i know to go hunting for seasonal rain and they fly south as the monsoon withdraws to the south they come down through karnataka into kerala and then they but they are incredibly good fliers this particular species it can fly for thousands of kilometers and it just keeps going and the wind the northeast wind swooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to africa where the young of this generation they hatched out in india they're looking for somewhere to breed if it rains here they'll breed but most of them are going to carry on and next out of a long drought just last week the rains broke the short rains broke and it's raining there now and the dragonflies are there i have reports from my various contacts the dragonflies are here now they're breeding there when those guys they'll lay their eggs now the sun is overhead maximum heating maximum evaporation maximum clouds maximum rainfall maximum opportunities for reproduction not only that because you have this drawn towards it to replace the air that's rising so the little fellow that hatches out here he gets up in to the air he is automatically carried to where the rain is falling lay their eggs next generation they come up automatically carried to where the rain is falling it's now back there they come out it's time to come back so in four generations one two three four and then back a complete circuit of the indian ocean this is a circuit about sixteen thousand kilometers sixteen thousand kilometers four generations mind you for a two inch long insect it's quite incredible those of you from north america will be familiar with the monarch butterfly now when i talk about the northeast monsoon season i'm sure many of you here know exactly what i mean but perhaps some of you are not quite so sure i need to explain a little bit about monsoons which up until now has had the longest known insect migration it's only half the length of this one and this crossing here of the ocean is the only truly regular transoceanic crossing of any insect a quite incredible feat and i only stumbled on this because i was living in mala in maldives for long enough for it to percolate into my brain that something rather special was going on china and russia up here in the far east so siberia manchuria and that's where it breeds and if you're a falcon it's quite a nice place to be in the summer but it's a pretty miserable place to be in the winter it 's well you can imagine so as any sensible bird would do he moves south they move south the whole population moves south but then the being sensible stopped so now they don't stop here or even down here no they turn across here they have a little and down here and they winter down here incredible this is the most extraordinary migration of any bird of prey a quite incredible migration and these birds what i've done is i've complied all the records all the available records of these birds put them together and found out they migrate at exactly the same time as the dragonflies got back to base and they pulled the remains of one of these out flying at night over the indian ocean two thousand four hundred and twenty four meters same height as the dragonflies go so they are using the same winds and the other thing the other important factor for all these birds all medium sized fellows and this includes the next slide as well which is a bee eater bee eaters eat bees this one has a nice blue cheek it's blue cheeked bee eater and every one of these birds that makes the crossing from india to east africa eats insects large insects the size of dragonflies thank you and in the summer india heats up gets very hot hot air rises and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it and,1
99,CharlesFleischer_2005.sph.wav,i didn't just draw this in a day by the way you know try making some charts like this at home you gotta be accurate there's measurement involved increments these are maps by the way not stamps but one day this is the moon people could live there one day i'll meet you at frigoris no i don't think so punch golden ratio it's crazy and look at this built within it is the golden ratio i start looking at that and look at them again they start looking like planets i go to was right days in a year there we see mars again with various names and this is all done by the way by the international astronomical union this is an actual group of people that sit around naming planetary objects this is from their actual book these are some of the names that they have chosen ladies and gentlemen i'll go through a little of them bolotnitsa that of course is the slavic swamp mermaid the whole concept of a mermaid doesn't really blend into the swamp feel look fluctus if that don't flow off the tongue what mean kids are studying this stuff and they've got the word fluctus up there that's wrong i am going to be talking about secrets obviously the best way to divulge a secret is to tell someone to not say anything about it that's a little more flowing hikuleo sounds like a kind of a leonardo dicaprio really i'm so busy with the stars would you mind taking the insects thank you darling oh take the spiders too i know they're not insects but i don't care monkeys chimps just get rid of now we're going to be going to mars one day and when we do it's going to be unfair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridiculous names so you'll be on mars and your at hellespointica depressio which has got to be a really up place yeah i'm at the depressio and i want to get over to amazonis so i plug it into the mars map and click the button and there's my directions cool name i will say that so i hold back a little of my venom for these astronomical misnomers and then of course arnon to and of course there will be advertisements this is from their rule book the international astronomical union and you know their international because they put it international for those of you who don't speak french i thought i'd translate for you from the rulebook nomenclature is a tool the first consideration make it clear simple and unambiguous and i think that djabran fluctus that fits that simple the goddess of goats very simple djabran fluctus now frank is this clear to you djabran fluctus yeah also from the actual document i highlighted a part i thought may be of interest anyone can suggest changing a name so i look to you fellow member of the earth community we've got to change this stuff up fast so these are actual names of people that work there i did some more investigation these are more people working for this group and as you can see they don't use their first names and when you use these things you don't have to go like that these are people naming planets and they won 't use their first names something is askew here is it because his name is really jupiter that mars i don't know but it's investigative material no doubt there are some mapping people who do use their names witness please eugene shoemaker make maps that 's wonderful eugene you could make maps of toronto no i want to make maps of planets seems a little silly to me there are no jovians getting back to my premise i used stamps by the way because you don't have to pay anybody for the rights by the way that's a natural picture of saturn no adjustments i mean that's just beautiful so beautiful that i will even give up a laugh to explain my love of this particular planet and the day saturday named after it wonderfully so formulas relate number to form that's euler his formula was one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory which is kind of cool not that funny but it is cool yes he was also famous for having no body which is one of the five sacred solids very important shapes you see the icosahedron again the dodecahedron it's dual there is a dodecahedron which i had to do in my room last night the five sacred solids as you can see there which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads i'm sure just change blue cheese ranch oil and vinegar thousand islands and house i suggest the house the reality now here is something important what's important about this is these shapes are duals of each other and you can see how the icosahedron withdraws into the dodecahedron and then they just merge into each other so the whole concept of branes in the universe if the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron this is is a very good map of what could possibly be and that is of course what we are here to talk about what a coincidence october in france jean pierre luminet said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron based on information that they got from this probe this would be a normal wave pattern but what they're seeing way out there in the far reaches of the microwave background is this kind of odd undulation it doesn't what they suspected a flat universe would be so you can kind of get and idea from this extrapolating bill gates the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger and for me really hurry up i just threw this in because as important as all of our intellectual abilities are without heart and without love it's just it's all meaningless and that to me is really beautiful back to the point of my particular presentation kepler one of my great who realized that these five solids which i spoke of earlier were related somehow to the planets but he couldn't prove it it freaked him out but it did lead to i am not suggesting at all that my vietnamese brothers and sisters could maybe use a little art class here and there but that's not my slides but it's okay not a good picture now my friends in the island of nevis are a little better look at that what a handsome cat once again nicaragua let me down and copurnicus looks like johnny carson which is really that at all once again these guys rock it out isaac is kickin ass man he looks like a rock star this is freaky is a major way this is sierra leone they got little babies in there floating in i don't really need to comment on this but i didn't know that isaac newton was in the moody blues as you can see these are all maps and maps are important devices for transferring information especially if you have human cognitive ability it's a different kind of course and they've got five apples i mean these guys are extrapolating in realms that are not necessarily valid although five is a good number of course ecuador my friend kepler as you can see this is of course the cartesian coordinates once again that's sierra leone this is again indicating how numbers relate to space relate to form maps of the universe because that's why we're here really i think now monaco took descartes and just flipped him around now monaco is problematic for me and i'll show you why here is a map all they have is a casino on and why franklin delano roosevelt is on their map i don't even want to hazard a guess but i'd say he'd been to hellespointica depressio recently this is the flag of monaco ladies and gentlemen the flag of indonesia please examine not sure how this came to be but it's not right in monaco no what are you talking about they are so different look ours is more red it's longer was a guy named titus and the reason i just bring this up because it is a law that doesn't really work that's jude law and some of his films we can see that all formulas are really maps now as humans we make maps of places that we seldom even go which seems a little wasteful of time this of course is a map of the moon prime numbers gauss one of my favorites golden section i've been obsessed with this thing since before i was born that scares a lot of you but that was my purpose entirely there we can see fibonacci numbers related to the golden section because fibonacci and golden section relate to the unfolding of the measured meter of mater as i refer to it if fibonacci had been on paxil that alright where is this going that's a good question here is the premise that i began twenty seven years ago if numbers can express the laws of this incredible universe that we live i reason through some sort of reverse engineering we could extrapolate from them some basic structural element of this universe and that's what i did twenty seven years ago i started working on this and i tried to build a particle accelerator and that didn't work out well so then i thought a calculator is a metaphor i can just divide numbers that's like atom smashing that's what i did that's how i found moleeds moleeds are what i believe the thing that will allow string to be proved they are the nodes on the string patterns and relationships twenty seven thirty seven that was the first chart i came up with you can see even if you don't go for the numbers the beauty of the symmetry the numbers from one to thirty six divided into six groups symmetry pairs every top adds up to thirty seven bottom all seventy four there is so many intricate relationships that i'm not going to go there now because you would say hey go back to the fluctus circle of fifths acoustic harmony geometric symmetry i knew those two were related once again the cartesian kind of some very delightful names tranquilacalitis my favorite is frigoris what are these people thinking frigoris what the frigoris you doing names are so i said if i'm going to put a circle see what kind of patterns i get boom the red system look at that you can't just make this stuff you'll see over here these are multiples of the number twenty seven and they recapitulate that shape even though that's a circle of nine and that's a circle of thirty six make that stuff of a tree ladies and gentlemen here at ted why because this is the place if aliens land i hope they come here last year i have found these subsequent systems which allow for the mathematic possibilities of the calabi yau manifolds in a way that doesn't necesitate these little hidden dimensions which works mathematically but it just doesn't seem god like to me it just seems like it's not sexy and elegant it's hidden i don't want hidden is like crazy am i the only one that sees this,1

people very complicated so i thought i should some stories i should tell you some stories about remarkable people so i thought i'd start with my mother and she was dark my mother was english my parents met in oxford in the fifties and my mother moved to nigeria and she was five foot two very feisty and very english this is how english my mother is or was she just passed she came out to california to los angeles to visit me and we went to malibu which she thought was very and then we went to a fish restaurant and we had chad the surfer dude serving us and he came up and my mother said do you have any specials my mother turned to me and said what i said english mum and she shook her head and said so this woman who converted from the church of england to catholicism when she married my father and there's no one more rabid than a catholic convert decided to teach in the rural areas in nigeria particularly among igbo women the billings ovulation method which was the only approved birth control by the catholic church wasn't too good so she took me along to translate never discuss their period with their husbands how swollen is your vulva she never would have thought of herself as a feminist my mother but she always used to say anything a man can do i can fix and when my father complained about this situation where she's taking a seven year old boy to teach this birth control you know he used to say oh you're turning him into you're teaching him how to be a woman my mother said someone has this woman during the biafran war we were caught in the war it was my mother with five little children it takes her one year through refugee camp after refugee camp to make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country at every single refugee camp she has to face off soldiers who want to take my elder brother mark who was nine and make him a boy soldier can you imagine this five foot two woman standing up to men with guns who want to kill us all through that one year my mother never cried one time not but when we were in lisbon in the airport about to fly to england it was basically see through with five really hungry looking kids came over and asked her what had happened and she told this woman and so this woman emptied out her suitcase and all of her clothes to my mother and to us and the toys of her kids who didn't like that very much look away from the darkest things about us because any kind of horror but the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger will unstitch you the old women in my father 's village after this war and they would sing these dirges made up of these names dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you i really believe that we're never more beautiful than when we're most ugly because that's really the moment we really know what we're made of and they would sing them only when they planted the as though they were seeding the hearts of the dead but when it came for harvest time they would sing these joyful songs that were made up of the names of every child who had been born that these women enacted a lot of transformation and the word for marriage was the same one rebuilding rwanda did you also know that after apartheid when the new government went into the parliament houses which would seem to suggest that apartheid was entirely the business of men all of this to say never really counted always rites of passage for young men men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women that's essentially what it is and a lot of rituals involved killing little animals progressing along so when i turned thirteen and i mean it made sense it was agrarian community somebody had to kill the animals there was no whole foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at so when i turned thirteen it was my turn now to kill a goat chris said i grew up in nigeria with a whole generation in the eighties of students who were protesting a military dictatorship which has finally ended so it wasn't just me there was a whole generation of us this weird sensitive kid who couldn't really do it but i had to do it and i was supposed to do this alone but a friend of mine called emmanuel who was significantly older than me who 'd been a boy soldier during the biafran war decided to come with me which sort of made me feel good because he'd seen a lot of things now when i was growing up he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people and their intestines would fall out but they would keep running so this guy comes with me and i don't know if you've ever heard a goat or seen one they sound like human beings my friend brad kessler says we didn't become human until we started keeping goats a goat 's eyes are like a child puts his hand over the mouth of the goat covers this guy who 'd seen so much and who to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed such a quotidian experience still found it in himself to try to protect me i was a wimp i cried for a very long time and afterwards he didn't say a word he just sat there watching me cry for an hour and then afterwards he said to me it will always be difficult but if you cry like this every time you will die of just know that it is enough sometimes to know that it is difficult i was born two days after christmas so growing up you know i had a cake and everything but i never got any presents because born two days after christmas about nine and my uncle had just come back from germany and we had the catholic priest over my mother was entertaining him with tea and my uncle suddenly says where are chris presents and but what i've come to learn but he was desperate to show that he'd just come back so he summoned me up and he said go into the bedroom my bedroom take anything you want out of the is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures but in the simple he thought i'd take a book but i found an inflatable sheep waving this buzzing sheep around was completely unflustered just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said it 's all right daphne i'm scottish my last days in prison my cellmate was fourteen years old the name was john james if a family member committed a crime so here was this fourteen year old kid on death row and he had smuggled in two comics two comic books spiderman and x men he was obsessed and when he got tired of reading them he started to teach the men in death row how to read with these comic books and so i remember night after night you'd hear all these men these really hardened criminals huddled around john james reciting take that spidey say how do you know and he said oh i heard it on the they handcuffed him to a chair in south africa they have a phrase called that they built their own gods come together as a community and their wish would then be brought to a priest who would find a ritual object and the appropriate sacrifices would be made became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice destroy the god they would knock down the shrine we're building gods that have gone rampant time we started knocking them their names it doesn't require a tremendous thing all it requires is to recognize among us every day the few of us that can see are surrounded by people amazing people who offer all of us the mirror to our own only way for me to be human is for you to reflect my humanity back at me but if you're like me my humanity is more like a window i don't really see it i don't pay attention to it until i want to end with a poem by an american poet called lucille clifton the poem is called libation and it's for my friend vusi who is in the audience here i offer to this ground i imagine an old man crying here out of the sight of the overseer he pushes his tongue where his tooth would be if he in that space where his tooth would be where his land would be his house his wife beautiful daughter he wipes sorrow from his face and puts his thirsty finger to his thirsty tongue and tastes the salt i call a name that could be his this is for you like a bug that's dead on the window then suddenly i see it and usually it's never good it's usually when i'm cussing in traffic,1
102,ChrisAnderson_2002.sph.wav,and all this had come from nothing fifteen years earlier i was a science journalist who people just laughed at when i said i really would like to start my own computer magazine and fifteen years later there are there are one hundred of them and two thousand people on staff and it was just such heady times the date was february two thousand i thought the little of my business life that kind of looked a bit like moore 's law ever upward onto the right it was going to go on forever i mean it had to i was in for quite a surprise the dot com ironically called snowball was the very last consumer web company to go public the next month before nasdaq exploded and i entered eighteen months of business hell i saw i watched everything that this is your conference and i think you have a right to know a little bit right now in this transition period about this guy who 's going to be looking after it for you for crumbling and it looked like all this stuff was going to die and fifteen years work would have come for nothing in the business february two thousand and one in one day we laid off three hundred and fifty people and before the bloodshed was finished one thousand people had lost their jobs from from my companies by about a million dollars a day every day for eighteen months and worse than that far worse than that my sense of self worth was kind of evaporating i was going around with this big sign on my forehead loser and i think what disgusts me more than anything looking back is how the hell did i let my personal happiness get so tied up with this business thing in the end we were able to save future and snowball but i was at that point ready to move on and to cut a long story short here 's where i came to and the reason i'm telling this story is that i believe from many conversations that a lot of people in this room have been through a similar kind of rollercoaster emotional rollercoaster in the last couple years this has been a big big transition time and i believe that this conference can a big part for all of us in taking us forward to the next stage to whatever 's next the theme next year is re birth it was at the same ted two years ago when richard and i reached an agreement on the future of ted and at about the same time and i think partly because of that i started doing something that i'd forgotten about in my business focus i started to read again and i discovered that while i'd been busy playing business games there'd been this incredible revolution in so many areas of interest cosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropology to you know all this stuff had changed and the way in which you could think about us as a species and us as a planet had just changed so much and it was incredibly exciting and what was really most exciting and i think richard wurman discovered this at least twenty years before i did was that all this stuff is connected it's connected it all hooks into each other we talk about this a lot and i thought about trying to of this just one example madame de gaulle the wife of the french president was famously asked once what do you most desire and she and when you think about it it's very true what we all most desire is a penis or you know happiness as we say in english that one in the japanese translation today it turns out that there's dozens of ted like questions that you can ask about it which are really interesting you can ask about what causes it biochemically neuroscience serotonin all that stuff years ago at ted i think i've come to this conclusion i think i may have been suffering from a strange delusion you can ask what are the psychological causes of it nature nurture current circumstance turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind blowing you can view it as a computing problem an artificial intelligence problem why do you need to incorporate some sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly you can view it in sort of geopolitical terms and say why is it that a billion people on this planet are so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness and whereas almost all the rest of them or you can view it as an evolutionary psychology kind of thing why would our did our genes invent this as a kind of trick to get us to behave in certain ways brain parasitized to make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate are we the victims of a mass delusion and so to understand even something as important to us as happiness you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions and there's nowhere that i've discovered other than ted where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions and so it's the profound thing that richard talks about to understand you just need to understand the little bits a little bit about everything that surrounds it and so gradually over these three days you start off kind of trying to figure out why am i listening to all this irrelevant stuff and at the end of the four days brain is humming and you feel energized alive and excited and it's because all these different bits have been put together it's the total brain experience we're going to it's the mental equivalent of the full body massage every mental i think that i may have believed unconsciously then that i was kind of a business hero really is enough of the theory chris tell us what you're actually going to do all right so i will here 's the vision for ted number one do nothing this thing ain't broke so i jeff bezos kindly remarked to me chris ted is a really great conference you're going to have to fuck up really badly so i gave myself the job title of ted diversity no selling no corporate bullshit no bandwagoning no platforms just the pursuit of interest wherever it lies across all the disciplines that are represented here that's not going to be changed at all the time scale on which ted operates is just fantastic after coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines there's a year to do this and already as i hope to show you a bit later there's twenty five or so terrific speakers signed up for next year had this company that i'd spent fifteen years building it was called future it was a magazine publishing company it had recently gone public do want to if i can find a way of extending the ted experience throughout the year and one key way that we're going to do this is to introduce this book club books kind of saved me in the last couple years and that's a gift that i would like to pass on so when you sign up for ted two thousand and three every six weeks you'll get a care package with a book or two and a reason why they're linked to ted they may well be by a ted speaker i think it will be great and then fourthly i want to mention the foundation which is the new owner of ted what sapling 's ownership means is that all of the proceeds of ted will go towards the causes that sapling stands for and more important i think the ideas that are exhibited and realized here ideas that the foundation can use because there's fantastic synergy already just in the last few days we've had so many people talking about stuff that they care about that they're passionate about that can make a difference in the world and the idea of getting this group of people together some of the causes that we believe in the money that this conference can raise and the ideas i really believe that that combination will and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars a number i didn't really understand time make a difference i'm incredibly excited about that in fact i don't think overall that i've been as excited by anything ever in my life i'm in this for the long run and i would be greatly honored and excited if you'll come on this journey with me a magazine i'd recently launched called business two point zero was fatter than a telephone directory busy pumping hot air into the bubble and i was the forty percent owner of a dot com that was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more,1
103,ChrisAnderson_2004.sph.wav,about to crash into the trough of disillusionment or rise back in the slope of enlightenment or et cetera and this is one way to do technology forecasting get a sense of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn we tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important we'll typically do it twice once we want to do it first i'd like to speak about technology trends which is something that and that's one way that we try to time technology trends i'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that i call my grand unified theory of predicting the future but it's a petite unified theory of predicting the future it's based on the presumption the observation even for example a critical price line that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world it's an inflection point and these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology 's life is going to be and maybe how you is the critical price the first stage in a technology 's advance is that it'll fall below a critical price will tend if it's successful to rise above a critical mass a penetration and that's another important point and then finally a lot of technologies commoditize towards the end of their life they become nearly free each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it it's an opportunity for the technology to change and even if you missed you know the first boom of wi fi you know wi fi did the critical price it did the critical mass but hasn't done displacement yet and hasn't done free yet there's still more opportunity in that i'd like to demonstrate what i mean by this by telling the story of the dvd which is a technology which has done all of these and it started to take off and you can see that the units started to trend up the hidden inflection point it was taking off the next thing it hit a year later was critical mass in this case twenty percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household and what's interesting here is that something else took off along with it home theater units suddenly you have a dvd in the house you've got high quality digital video you have a reason to have a big screen television you have a reason for dolby five point one surround sound the next phase it hit was displacement you can see around two thousand and one it finally out sold the vcr netflix was right the netflix model could capitalize on the dvd in a way that the video rental stores couldn 't among the dvd 's many assets is that it's very small you can stick it in the mailer has several times in the past year been the number one dvd seller in america their average price for last year was forty eight dollars you're aware of the as they get cheaper the premium brands the sonys and such are losing market share and the no names the apexes are gaining them they're being commodified and that's what happens when things go to zero it's a tough market out there now they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology these four stages of technology 's life i'd like to talk about some other technologies out there just technologies on our radar and i'll use this lens these four as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its development they're not necessarily the top ten technologies out there they're just examples of technologies that are in each one craig venter indeed comes today he may tell you something about this to sequence the human genome for forty million dollars by the end of this year that's as opposed to billions just a few years ago you know our ability to we also like a lot of companies create a product that's based on technology trends in this case ours is about ideas and information and if we're lucky some entertainment there will come a day when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done very cheaply if you want to know you can learn about your own mosaic two thousand the price was ten thousand dollars or twenty seven dollars a day the generics came in first in brazil and elsewhere and the effect was just dramatic on believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by two thousand and five two million in sub saharan africa and the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with but the concept 's quite the same and so we have to understand not only why tech 's important where it's going but also very importantly when see the direction those lines are going you can see that at the twenty percent it's now taken seriously it's not just for the geeks any more that is i imagine what people in redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars i don't know whether anybody has a prius two thousand and four but they're fantastic and if you look at the trends here by about two thousand and eight and i don't think this is a crazy forecast be two percent of auto sales two percent isn't twenty percent but in the car business which is slow moving that's huge that's arrival at two percent you start seeing them on the roads everywhere and what's interesting about the hybrids taking off is you've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry it's the first radical change in automobile technology in one hundred years and once you have electric motors you can do anything you can change the structure of the car in any way you want you can have regenerative braking you can have drive by wire you can have replaceable body shapes it's a little thing that starts with a hybrid but it can lead to a whole new era of the car voice over ip is something you may have heard something about again it's kind of coming out of nowhere it's a little hard to use right now there's a company created by that's critical mass and the same thing 's happening on the carrier side you're looking at ip taking over from some of the traditional telecom the timing is everything this is a tipping point here forgive me look a little bit like that and finally free free is really really interesting free is that comes with digital because the reproduction costs are essentially free it comes with ip and here you have just the number of songs can be stored on a hard drive you know and you've seen the numbers i mean you know the music industry is imploding in front of our very eyes and hollywood's worried as well they're facing a force is draconian about e commerce or internet traffic or broadband adoption or internet advertising and not necessarily the one that's going to get them out of this has a regulated phone system and so did we it was surprisingly non innovative moved very slowly but then so much fiber out there you couldn't hold back and look how quickly the price fell it's seven cents a minute in many cases and the consequence of cheap free phone calling to india is they were all right and any other country that can contact our markets and will work with our companies wrong in time that's why timing is everything you've probably seen something like this before this is the classic gartner hype curve which talks about kind of the trajectory of a technology 's lifespan and just for fun we put a bunch of technologies on it to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak,1
104,ChrisAnderson_2010G.sph.wav,a good friend of ted who just happens to live in africa 's biggest shantytown into a garden the same spot it was a crime spot where people were being robbed they used the same trash to form the same trash site is feeding more than thirty families we have our own film school to record edit and reporting to their own channel kibera tv the sacks to grow vegetables and also able to save on the cost of living change happens when we see things today i see kibera in a different way my message to tedglobal and the entire world is kibera is a hotbed of innovation and chris has always been an inspiring guy what's new and it's huge is that for the first time we get to see him and he can see us right now chris and kevin and dennis and dickson and their friends are watching us in nairobi right now guys we've learned from you today thank you and thank you in essence dancers were challenging each other online to get better incredible new dance skills were being invented even the six year olds were joining in it felt like a revolution and so jon had a brilliant idea he went out to recruit the best of the best dancers off of youtube to this dance troupe the league of extraordinary dancers the lxd these kids were they were so good that they got to play at the and at ted here in february their passion and brilliance just took our breath away this story of the evolution of seems strangely familiar you know a while after tedtalks started taking off we noticed that speakers were starting to spend a lot more time in preparation it was resulting in incredible new talks like these two months of preparation crammed into eighteen minutes raising the bar cruelly for the next generation of speakers with the effects that we've seen this week it's not as if j j and jill actually ended their talks saying step your game up but they might as well have so in both of these cases you've got these cycles of improvement apparently driven by people watching web video what is going on here well i think it's the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call crowd accelerated innovation and there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear you can think of them as three dials on a giant wheel you turn up the dials the wheel starts to and the firs thing you need is a crowd a group of people who share a common interest the bigger the crowd the more potential innovators there are the second thing you need is light you need clear open visibility of what the best people in that crowd are capable of because that is how you will learn how you will be empowered to participate and hard work it's based on hundreds of hours of research of practice absent desire not going to happen now here 's an example pre internet of this machine in action dancers at a street corner it's a crowd a small one but they can all obviously see what each other can do and the desire part comes i guess from social status right best dancer walks tall gets the best date there's probably going to be some innovation happening here but on the web all three dials are ratcheted right up the dance community is now global there's millions connected and amazingly you can still see what the best can do because the crowd itself shines a light on them directly through comments ratings email facebook twitter or indirectly through numbers of views and i'm also a little nervous about this there are nine billion humans coming our way the desire element is really dialed way up i mean you might just be a kid with a webcam but if you can do something that goes viral you get to be seen by the equivalent of sports stadiums crammed with people you get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you and even if it's not that eloquent and it's not it can still really make your day so this possibility of a new type of global recognition i think is driving huge amounts of and it's important to note that it's not just the stars who are benefiting because you can see the best everyone can learn also the system is self fueling it's the crowd that shines the light and fuels the desire but the light and desire are a lethal one two combination that attract new people to the crowd so this is a model any organization could use to try and nurture its own cycle of crowd accelerated innovation invite the crowd let in the light dial up the the most optimistic dreams can get dented by the prospect of people plundering the planet but recently it's by giving away what you think is your deepest secret that maybe millions of people are empowered to help improve it and very happily there's one class of people who really can't make use of this tool the dark side of the web is allergic to the light i don't think we're going to see terrorists for example publishing their plans online and saying to the world please could you help us to actually make them work this time you can publish your stuff online and if you can get that wheel to turn look out so at ted we've become a little obsessed with this idea of openness in fact my colleague june cohen has taken to calling it radical openness because it works for us each time we opened up our talks to the world and suddenly there are millions of people out there helping spread our speakers ideas and thereby making it easier for us to recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers by opening up our translation program thousands of heroic volunteers some of them watching online right now and thank you have translated our talks into more than seventy languages thereby tripling our viewership in non english speaking countries by giving away our tedx brand we suddenly have a thousand plus live experiments in the art of spreading ideas and these organizers they're seeing each other they're learning from each other i've become intrigued by a different way of thinking of large human crowds because there are circumstances where they can do something really cool it's really not news for me to tell you that innovation emerges out of groups you know we've heard that this week this romantic notion of the lone genius with the eureka moment that changes the world is misleading even he said that and he would a social species we spark off each other it's also not news to say that the internet has accelerated innovation for the past fifteen years powerful communities have been connecting online sparking off each other if you take programmers you know the whole open source movement is a fantastic instance of crowd accelerated innovation what's key here is the reason these groups have been able to connect is because their work output is of the type that can be easily shared digitally a picture a music file software and that's why what i'm excited about and what i think is under reported is the significance of the rise of online video this is the technology that's going to allow the rest of the world 's talents to be shared digitally thereby launching a whole new cycle of crowd accelerated innovation the first it's a phenomenon that i think any organization or individual can tap into it certainly impacted the way we think about ted 's future and perhaps the world 's future overall few years of the web were pretty much video free for this reason video files are huge the web couldn't handle them but in the last ten years cisco actually estimates that within four years more than ninety percent of the web 's data will be video if it's all puppies porn and piracy we're doomed i don't think it will be video is high bandwidth for a reason it packs a huge amount of data and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it here let me introduce you to sam haber looking at video clips posted by strangers a world of possibility opens up for him suddenly he starts to emulate and then to innovate and a global community of unicyclists discover each other online inspire each other to greatness and there are thousands of other examples of this happening of video driven evolution of skills ranging from the physical to the and i have to tell you as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines i find this strangely beautiful i mean there's a lot of passion right here on this screen but if rube goldberg machines and video poetry aren't quite your cup of tea how about this jove is a website that was founded to encourage scientists to publish their peer reviewed research on video so let 's explore the story starts with just a single person a child behaving a little strangely this if you can show instead of just describing that problem goes away so it's not far fetched to say that at some point online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance here 's another example that's close to our hearts at ted where video is sometimes more powerful than print the sharing of an idea why do people like watching all those ideas are already out there in print it's actually faster to read than to view why would someone bother well so there's some showing as well as telling but even leaving the screen out of it there's still a lot more being transferred than just words and in that non verbal portion there's some serious magic somewhere hidden in the physical gestures the vocal cadence the facial expressions the eye contact the passion the kind of awkward british body language the sense of how the audience are reacting there are hundreds of subconscious clues that go to how well you will understand and whether you're inspired light if you like and desire incredibly all of this can be communicated on just a few square inches of a screen this is the connective tissue of the human superorganism in action it's probably driven our culture for millennia five hundred years ago it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage but now in the blink of an eye the game has changed again it's not too much to say that what gutenberg did for writing that just went global now this is big we may have to reinvent an ancient art form i mean today one person speaking can be seen by millions how did he learn them and what drove him to spend the hundreds of hours of practice this must shedding bright light on potent ideas creating intense desire for learning and to respond and in his case intense desire to for the first time in human history talented students don't have to have their potential and their dreams written out of history by lousy teachers they can sit two feet in front of the world 's finest now ted is just a small part of this i mean the world 's universities are opening up their curricula thousands of individuals and organizations are sharing their knowledge and data online so we're dreaming of ways to make it easier for you the global ted community to respond to speakers to contribute your own ideas maybe even your own and to help shine a light on the very best of what's out there because if we can bubble up the very best from a vastly larger pool this wheel turns now is it possible to imagine a similar process to this happening to global education overall have to be this painful top down process why not a self fueling cycle in which we all can participate it's the participation age right schools can't be silos we can't stop learning at age twenty one what if in the coming crowd of nine billion what if that crowd could learn enough to be net contributors instead of net plunderers that changes everything right i mean that would take more teachers than we've ever had but the good news is they are out there teacher teacher part of the crowd that may be about to launch the biggest learning cycle in human history a cycle capable of carrying all of us to a smarter wiser more beautiful place so that was sent to me by this of kids in a village in pakistan near where i grew up within five years each of these kids is going to have access to a cellphone capable of full on web video it crazy to think that this girl in the back at the right in fifteen years might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful for your grandchildren it's not crazy it's actually happening right now,1
105,ChrisJordan_2008.sph.wav,now that number is dwarfed by the number of paper cups we use every day and that is forty million cups a day for hot beverages most of which is coffee i couldn't fit forty million cups on a canvas but i was able to put four hundred and ten thousand is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously on a collective level speaking of justice there's another phenomenon going on in our culture that i find deeply troubling and that is that america right now has the largest percentage of its population in prison of any country on earth one out of four people one out of four humans in prison are americans imprisoned in our country and i wanted to show the number the number is two point three million americans were incarcerated in two thousand and five and that's gone up since then but we don't have the numbers yet so i wanted to show two point three million prison uniforms and in the actual print of this piece each uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge they're tiny they're barely visible as a piece of material and to show two point three million of them required a canvas that was larger than any printer in the world would print and so i had to divide it up into multiple panels that are ten feet tall by twenty five feet wide and what i mean by that it's the behaviors that we're in denial about and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness more than four hundred thousand people die in the united states every year from smoking cigarettes and so this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes and as you slowly step back you see that it's a painting by van gogh called skull with cigarette it's a strange thing to think about that on nine eleven when that tragedy happened three thousand americans died and do you remember the response it reverberated around the world the tobacco lobby it's too strong we just dismiss it out of our consciousness and knowing what we know about the destructive power of cigarettes we continue to allow our children our sons and daughters to be in the presence of the influences that start them smoking and this is what the next piece is about this is just lots and lots of cigarettes sixty five thousand cigarettes which is equal to the number of teenagers and as individuals we all do these things all the time everyday it's like when you're mean to your wife because you're mad at somebody else who will start smoking this month and every month in the us more than seven hundred thousand children in the united states aged eighteen and under begin smoking every year one more strange epidemic in the united states that i want to acquaint you with is this phenomenon of abuse and misuse of prescription drugs this is an image i've made out of lots and lots of vicodin well actually i only had one vicodin that i scanned lots and lots of times and so as you stand back you see two hundred and thirteen thousand vicodin pills which is the number of hospital emergency room visits yearly in the united states attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers and anti anxiety medications one third of all drug overdoses in the u s and that includes cocaine heroin alcohol everything one third of drug overdoses are prescription medications this is a piece that i just recently completed about another tragic phenomenon and that is the phenomenon this growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery three hundred and eighty four thousand women american women last year for elective breast augmentation surgery given to young girls who are about to go off to college so i made this image out of barbie dolls and so as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern and as you get all the way back you see thirty two thousand barbie dolls which represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries that are performed in the u s each month the vast majority of those are on women under the age of twenty one and strangely enough the only plastic surgery that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction and most of that is being done by men or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt or whatever and have this fear that we aren't feeling enough as a culture right now this kind of anesthesia in america at the moment and our grief about what's going on in our culture right now what's going on in our country the atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world they've gone missing these feelings have gone missing our cultural joy our national joy is nowhere to be seen and one of the causes of this i think is that as each of us attempts to build this new kind of world view this this holographic image that we're all trying to create in our mind of the inter connection of things the environmental footprints one thousand miles away of the things that we buy the social consequences when we do these kind of things when three hundred million people do unconscious behaviors then it can add up to a catastrophic consequence that nobody wants and no one intended and that's what i look at with my photographic work ten thousand miles away of the daily decisions that we make as consumers as we try to build this view and try to educate ourselves about the enormity of our culture the information that we have to work with is these gigantic numbers bush 's new budget is in the trillions and these are numbers that our brain just doesn't have the ability to comprehend we can't make meaning out of these enormous statistics more than they do now if we can find that then we'll be able to find within each one of us what it is that we need to find to face the big question which is how do we change that to me is the big question that we face as a people right now how do we change how do we change as a culture each individually take responsibility for the one piece of the solution that we are in charge is that you don't have to make yourself to look at these issues not pointing the finger at america in a blaming way i'm simply saying this is who we are right now if there are things that we see that we don't like about our culture then we have a choice the degree of integrity that each of us can bring to the surface to bring to this question as we show up for the question of how do we change it's already defining us and it will profoundly affect the well being the quality of life of the billions of people i'm not speaking abstractly about this this is who we are in this room right now in this moment thank and as you get a little bit closer it starts looking like lots of pipes like maybe a and in fact this is one million plastic cups which is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights in the united states every six hours we use four million cups a day on airline flights and virtually none of them are reused or recycled they just don't do that in that industry,1
106,ChristienMeindertsma_2010G.sph.wav,well basically it's a product catalog of this one pig and it carries a duplicate of his ear tag on the back and it consists of seven chapters the chapters are skin bones meat internal organs blood fat and miscellaneous in total they weigh one hundred and three point seven kilograms and to show you how often you actually meet part of this pig in a regular day i want to show you some images of the book you probably start the day with a shower so in soap fatty acids made from boiling pork bone fat are used as a hardening agent but also for giving it a pearl like if you look around you in the bathroom you see lots more products like shampoo conditioner anti wrinkle cream body lotion but also toothpaste then so before breakfast you've already met the pig so many times then at breakfast the pig that followed the hairs off the pig or proteins from the hairs off the pig were used as an improver of dough i would like to start my talk with actually two questions and the first one is how many people here actually eat pig meat well when you're off to work under the road or under the buildings that you see there might very well be cellular concrete which is a very light kind of concrete that's actually got proteins from bones inside and it's also fully reusable in the train brakes at least in the german train brakes there's this part of the brake that's made of bone ash and in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts like chocolate mousse tiramisu vanilla pudding everything that's cooled in the supermarket there's gelatin to make it look good fine bone china this is a real classic of course the bone in fine bone china gives it its translucency and also its strength in order to make these really fine shapes like this used in paint for the texture but also for the glossiness in sandpaper bone glue is actually the glue between the sand and the paper and then in paintbrushes hairs are used because apparently they're very suitable for making paintbrushes because of their hard wearing nature i was not planning on showing you any meat because of course half the book 's meat and you probably all know what meats they are but i didn't want you to miss out on this one because this well it's called portion controlled meat cuts and this is actually sold in the frozen area of the supermarket and what it is it's actually steak so this is sort of cow but what happens when you slaughter a cow at least in industrial factory farming and how many people have actually seen a live pig producing this meat they have all these little bits of steak left that they can't actually sell as steak so what they do is they glue them all together with fibrin from pig blood into this really large sausage freeze the sausage cut it in little slices and sell those as steak again and this also actually happens with tuna and scallops so with the steak you might drink a beer in the brewing process there's lots of cloudy elements in the beer so to get rid of these cloudy elements what some companies do is they pour the beer through a kind of gelatin sieve in order to get rid of this actually also goes for wine as well as actually a company in greece that produces these cigarettes that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter and according to them this creates an artificial lung in the filter so this is actually a healthier cigarette this must be the strangest thing i found this is a coming from a very large ammunition company in the united states and while i was making the book i contacted all the producers of products come from you actually never see a pig which is really strange because on a population of sixteen million people we have twelve million pigs because i wanted them to send me the real samples and the real specimens so i sent this company an email saying hello i'm christien i'm doing this research and i thought that was really weird as if the dutch government sends emails to anyone so the most beautiful thing i found at least what i think is the most beautiful in the book is this heart valve it's actually a very low tech and very high tech product at the same time the low tech bit is that it's literally a pig 's heart valve mounted in the high tech bit which is a memory metal casing and what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart without open heart surgery and once it's in the right spot they remove the outer shell and the heart well it gets this shape and at that moment it starts beating instantly it's really a sort of magical moment so this is actually a dutch company so i called them up and i asked can i borrow a heart valve from you and the really enthusiastic so they were like okay we'll put it in a jar for you with formalin and you can borrow it great and then i didn't hear from them for weeks so and well of course the dutch can't eat all these pigs they eat about one third and the rest is exported to all kinds of countries in europe and the rest of the world a lot goes to the u k germany i called and i asked what 's going on with the heart valve and they said well the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart valve because want his product to be associated with the last product from the book that i'm showing you is renewable energy actually to show that my first question if pigs are still used up until the last bit was still true well it is because everything that can't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source i found one hundred and eighty five products and what they showed me is that well firstly that we don't treat these pigs as absolute kings and queens and the second is that we actually don't have a clue of what all these products that surround us are made of and you might think i'm very fond of pigs but actually well i am a little bit but i'm more fond of raw materials in general and i think that and what i was curious about because historically the whole pig would be used up until the last bit so nothing would be wasted and i was curious to find out if this was actually still the case and i spent about three years researching and i followed this one pig with number five thousand and forty nine all the way up until the end and to what products it's made of and in these years i met all kinds people like for instance farmers and butchers which seems logical but i also met aluminum mold makers ammunition producers and all kinds of people and what was striking to me is that the farmers actually had no clue what was made of their pigs but the consumers as in us had also no idea of the pigs being in all these products so what i did is i took all this research and i made it into a,1
107,ChristopherDeam_2002.sph.wav,the interiors were completely out of sync with that in fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin that seemed really like a crisis to me that they had never been able to we really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic in an airstream trailer and what feels like it has true purpose and utility we stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint i was asked by wilsonart international a plastic laminate company which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world they asked me to that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell we took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing i literally drew on the walls of the trailer mocked it up in cardboard we'd come in and cut decide things were wrong pull it out put it back in the main goal was to smooth out the interior and begin to speak about motion and mobility and independence the biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you're designing there's actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer there's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together where you can change curve interior what i had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell what i came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell and what i was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way and that the casework break up the space they also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin so they function as an electrical chase that's the trailer pretty much finished that trailer led to another commission to participate in whats called tokyo designers block its a week of furniture design events in tokyo in october design a trade show booth for exhibition at the international contemporary furniture fair in new york in two thousand teruo kurosaki who owns a furniture company called idee he asked me he said one he would like to make a real trailer functioning and we would sell that one trailer number two you have a blank slate you can to anything you want we came up with a fantasy scenario dj traveling around the states that would collect records and go on tours this trailer housed two turntables mixer wet bar it's got a huge couch fits quite a few people and basically we'd had a great time with this and so in this trailer i took it upon myself to think about this brings us up to the time that i started consulting to airstream they came to me and said well what can we do to freshen this thing do you think kids you know skateboarders surfers rock climbers would use these things and i said well not in that interior i thought finally oh yeah great big company i'm gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding and i walked in their prototype facility and it's exactly like my shop only bigger same tools same things so the problem became and they set this dilemma to me that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology and there's no money for tooling or molding the trailers themselves are actually hand built all the casework is hand scribed in uniquely so you can't just cut so looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design interiors and furniture you have to cut them big and every single one is hand fit they didn't want to go to a componentized system and there it is that's the bambi sixteen we came up with the solution of taking an old airstream trailer and gutting it and trying to portray laminate and a trailer in kind of a fresh new contemporary look when this trailer showed up at my shop in berkeley i'd actually never stepped foot in an airstream trailer or any other trailer so i can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if i can optimize it in its most idealistic fashion i decided i had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of airstream what i discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces in that the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight modern futuristic high tech pod for hurtling down the freeway,1
108,ChristopherMcDougall_2010X.sph.wav,paula radcliffe the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck out of derartu tulu 's under underdog hands suddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back ruins the script instead of taking off she falls back and she grabs paula radcliffe says come on go except derartu tulu ruins the script again instead of losing she blazes past the lead pack and wins wins the new york city marathon goes home with a big fat check it's a heartwarming story but if you drill a little bit deeper you've got to sort of wonder about what exactly was going on there you have two outliers in one organism it's not a coincidence when you have someone who is more competitive and more compassionate than anybody else in the race just right left right left yeah i mean we've been doing it for two million years so it's kind of arrogant to assume that i've got something to say can be found down in the copper canyons of mexico where there's a tribe a reclusive tribe called the tarahumara indians now the tarahumara are remarkable for three things number one is they have been living essentially unchanged for the past four hundred years when the conquistadors arrived in north america you had two choices you either fight back and engage or you could take off the mayans and aztecs engaged which is why there are very few mayans and aztecs the tarahumara had a different strategy they took off and hid in this the second thing remarkable about the tarahumara is deep into old age seventy to eighty years old these guys aren't running marathons they're running mega marathons they're not doing twenty six miles they're doing one hundred one hundred and fifty miles at a time and apparently without injury without problems the last thing that's remarkable about the tarahumara is that all the things that so what's the connection again we're talking about outliers there's got to be some kind of cause and effect there better a long time ago but the cool thing about running as i've discovered is that something bizarre happens in this activity all the time case in point well there are teams of scientists at harvard and the university of utah that are bending their brains to try to figure out what the tarahumara have known forever they're trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries and once again a mystery wrapped inside of a mystery the human brain exploded in size australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain suddenly humans show up homo erectus big old melon head to have a brain of that size you need to have a source of condensed caloric energy in other words early humans are eating dead animals no argument that's a fact is the first edged weapons only appeared about two hundred thousand years ago so somehow for nearly two million years we are killing animals without any weapons now we're not using our strength because we are the biggest sissies in the jungle every other animal is stronger than we are they have fangs they have claws they have nimbleness they have speed we think usain bolt is fast usain bolt can get his ass kicked by a squirrel we're not that would be an olympic event turn a squirrel loose whoever catches the squirrel you get a gold medal no weapons no speed no strength no fangs no claws how were we killing these animals a couple months ago if you saw the new york city marathon i guarantee you you saw something that no one has ever seen before an ethiopian woman named derartu but you get to the marathon we were just talking about you guys have only been allowed to run the marathon for twenty years because prior to the nineteen eighties and i've yet to see any runner like ann trason or nikki kimball or jenn shelton you put them in a race of fifty or one hundred miles against anybody in the world and it's a coin toss who 's a couple years ago emily baer signed up for a race called the hardrock one hundred which tells you all you need to know about the race they give you forty eight hours to finish this race turns up at the starting line she's thirty seven years old she hasn't won a marathon of any kind in eight years and a few months previous she almost died in childbirth if you start running the marathon at age nineteen you will get progressively faster year by year until you reach your peak at age twenty seven and then after that you succumb to the rigors of time and you'll get slower and slower until eventually you're back to running the same speed you were at age nineteen so about seven years eight years to reach your peak and then gradually you fall off your peak until you go back to the starting point you would think it might take eight years to go back to the same speed maybe ten years no it's forty five years sixty year old men and women are running as fast as they were at age nineteen now i defy you to come up with any other physical activity and please don't say golf something that actually is hard where geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers so you have these three mysteries is there one piece in the puzzle which might wrap all these things up but i'll submit this to you if you put one piece in the middle of this jigsaw puzzle suddenly it all starts to form a coherent picture if you wonder why is it the tarahumara don't fight and don't die of heart disease why a poor ethiopian woman named derartu tulu can be the most compassionate and yet the most competitive and why we somehow were able to find food without weapons we evolved as a hunting pack animal because the one advantage we have in the wilderness again it's not our fangs and our claws and our speed the only thing we do really really well is sweat we're really good at being sweaty and smelly better than any other mammal on earth we can sweat really well but the advantage of that little bit of social discomfort is the fact that when it comes to running under hot heat for long distances we're superb we're the best on the planet you take a horse on a hot day and after five or six miles that horse has a choice it's either going to breathe or it's going to cool off but it ain't doing both we can so what if we evolved as hunting pack animals what if the only natural advantage we had in the world was the fact that we could get together as a group go out there on that african savannah pick out an antelope and go out as a pack and run that thing to death those expert trackers have got to be part of the pack they can't be ten miles behind you need to have the women and the adolescents there because the two times in your life you most benefit except bad news for derartu tulu some other people had the same idea including the olympic gold medalist and paula radcliffe who is a monster the fastest woman marathoner in history in other words is a culture remarkably similar to the tarahumara a tribe that has remained unchanged since the stone age it's a really compelling argument that maybe the how do we spoil it well how do we spoil anything we try to cash in on it we try to can it and package it and make it better and sell it to people and what happened was we started creating these fancy cushioned things which make running better called running shoes any kind of myths any kind of tall tales running is always associated with freedom and vitality and youthfulness and eternal vigor it's only in our lifetime that running has become associated with fear and pain i didn't do yoga i'm not ready humans ran and ran all the time we are here today we have our digital technology all of our science comes from the fact that our ancestors able to do something extraordinary every day which was just rely on their naked feet and legs to run long distances so how do we get back to that again well i would submit to you the first thing is get rid of all packaging all the sales all the marketing get rid of all the stinking running shoes stop focusing on urban marathons which if you do four hours you suck if you do three fifty nine point five nine you're awesome because you qualified for another race we need to get back to that sense of playfulness and joyfulness and i would say nakedness that has made the the healthiest and serene cultures in our time the gun goes off and she's not even an underdog she's under the underdogs a little too extreme about this imagine a world where everybody could go out their door and engage in the kind of exercise that's going to make them more relaxed more serene more healthy and what the tarahumara have always been i don't say let 's go back to the copper canyons and live on corn and maiz which is the tarahumara 's preferred diet but maybe there's somewhere in between and if we find that thing maybe there is a big fat nobel prize out there because if somebody could find a way to restore but the under underdog hangs tough and twenty two miles into a twenty six mile race there is derartu tulu up there with the lead pack so what i've been seeing today is there is a growing subculture of barefoot runners people who got rid of their shoes and what they have found uniformly is you get rid of you get rid of the stress you get rid of the injuries and the ailments and what you find is something the tarahumara have know for a very long time that this can be a whole lot of now this is when something really bizarre happens,1
109,ChristopherPoole_2010.sph.wav,the largest memes that have come out of this site some of you might be familiar with are these lolcats just silly pictures of cats with text and this resonates with millions there are tens of thousands of these and there is a whole blogging empire now dedicated to pictures like these and rick astley 's kind of rebrith these past two years rickroll was this bait and switch really simple classic bait and switch there are thousands of memes that come out of the site there are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream the ones i've just shown you but every day every month people are producing thousands of these like this have rules we do they're the codified rules that i've come up with which are more or less ignored by the community and so they've come up with their own set of rules the rules of the internet and so there are three that i want to show you specifically rule one is you don't talk about b two is you do not talk about i will spare you that slide i assure you it is very true b is the first board we started with and it is in many ways the beating heart of the website it is where a third of all the traffic is going and b is known for more than anything not just the memes they've created but the exploits and chris just touched on one of those a second ago and that was the time one hundred poll so somebody at time at the magazine thought it would be fun to nominate me for this thing they did last year and so they placed me on it and the internet got wind of it my community i didn't instruct them to do it they just decided that that's what they wanted and so you know three hundred and ninety percent approval rating ain't so bad so they broke that and i ended up on top i ended up at this really fancy party but that's not what's interesting about this it's that they weren't putting me at the top of this list they were actually it got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed all of the top twenty one places to spell marblecake also the game the amount of time and effort that went into that is very famously scientology and so the story is scientology had this embarrassing video of tom cruise it went up online they got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the internet and they've been dogging me for a year i got to tell you it's driving me nuts actually sometimes i wake up in the middle of so we've got this activist group that's this grassroots group that's come out of the site and last i'm going to show you the example the story of dusty the cat is the name that we've given to this cat this young man for people to do something about this so what they did is they i mean they put c s i to shame here the internet detectives came out they matched they found his myspace they took the youtube video and they mashed everything in the video and within twenty four hours they had his name and within forty eight hours he was arrested sites like it are kind of going the way of the dinosaur right now they're endangered because we're moving towards social networking we're moving towards persistent identity we're moving towards you know a lack of privacy really we're sacrificing a lot of that and i think in doing so moving towards those things we're losing something valuable you that this is not being streamed to them live right now well you never know some of them we've got people in seventy five countries tell when i was fifteen i found this yes and no i mean for as much good that kind of comes out of this environment there is plenty of bad there are plenty of downsides but i think that the greater good is words saying things you know can be constructive it can be really damaging and if you cut the link between what is said and any attribution back to you i mean surely there are huge risks with that there are certainly but the board what you might say at ted right yeah i posted a thread on sunday and within twenty four hours it had over twelve thousand responses the thing is i didn't make it into that presentation because i can't read to you anything that they said know bleeped out but there were some good things that i'm not sure i would have necessarily recommended everyone at ted to go and check it out anyway yourself i mean you're a figure of some intrigue you've got this surprising semi underground influence but it's not making you a lot of money yet what's the commercial picture the commercial picture is that there really isn't much of one i guess the site has adult content on it it's got some very obscene content on it just in terms of language alone and when you've got that you've pretty much sacrificed any hope of making lots of money first very kind of pained awkward conversations the content is not dinner table conversation in the least but my parents i think part of why they and so in ten years time what do you picture yourself a good question as i said i just went back to school and i am considering majoring in urban studies and then going on to urban planning kind of taking whatever i've learned from online communities and trying to adapt that to what it looks like so what's unique about the site is that it's anonymous and it has no memory there's no archive are no barriers there's no registration these things that we're used to with forums don't exist on four chan and that's led to this discussion that's completely raw completely unfiltered,1
110,ChristopherdeCharms_2008.sph.wav,and that allows peter to look at his brain in real time as he 's inside the scanner he can look at these sixty five thousand points of activation per second if he can see this pattern in his own brain he can learn how to control it there have been three ways to try to impact the brain the therapist 's couch pills and the knife this is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have we all know that as we form thoughts they form deep channels in our minds and our brains chronic pain is an example if you burn yourself you pull your hand away but if you're still in pain in six months or six years time it's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you if we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain we can form three d models and watch in real time the brain process information and then we can select the areas that produce the pain so put your arms back up and flex your now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing what you're seeing here is we've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain may shock you but we're literally reading this person 's brain in real time they're watching their own brain activation and they're controlling the pathway that produces their pain they're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates as they do it in the upper left is a display that's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled when they control their brain they can control their pain this is an investigational technology but in clinical trials we're seeing a forty four to sixty four percent decrease in chronic pain patients this is not the matrix you can only do this to yourself you take control raise your arms and wave back just the way i am kind of a royal wave you can mimic what you can see you can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm soon you'll be able to look inside your brain i've seen inside my brain you will too soon when you do what do you want to control you will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself all your experiences these are some of the areas we're working on today that i don't have time to go into in detail but i want to leave with you the big question we are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into using this technology the human mind and brain where will we take it and program control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there i'm going to tell you about that technology people have wanted to look inside the human mind the human brain for thousands of years well coming out of the research labs just now for our generation is the possibility to do that but now we have a real technology to do this we're going to fly into my colleague peter 's brain we're going to do it non invasively using mri we don't have to inject anything we don't need radiation will be able to fly into the anatomy of peter 's brain literally fly into his body but more importantly we can look into his mind when peter moves his arm that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of peter 's mind taking place now you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains what's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis we've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds,1
111,ClayShirky_2005G.sph.wav,if there is an answer to that that happens outside the professional framework of journalism it makes no sense to take a professional metaphor and apply it to this distributed class so as much as we want the shield laws in new york city on the first saturday of every summer coney island our local charmingly run down amusement park hosts the mermaid parade background the institution to which they were attached is becoming incoherent here 's another example pro ana the pro ana groups these are groups of teenage girls who have taken on web logs bulletin boards other kinds of cooperative infrastructure and have used it to set up support groups for remaining anorexic by choice they post pictures of thin models which they call thinspiration they have little slogans like salvation through starvation they even have lance armstrong style bracelets these red bracelets which signify in the small group i am trying to maintain my eating disorder they trade tips like if you feel like eating something clean a toilet or the litter box the feeling will pass we're used to support groups being beneficial we have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial but it turns out that the logic of the support group is value neutral a support group is simply a small group that wants to maintain a way of living in the context of a larger group now when the larger group is a bunch of drunks and the small group wants to stay sober then we think that's a great support group when the small group is teenage girls who want to stay anorexic by choice then we're horrified what's happened is that the normative goals of the support groups that we're used to came from the institutions that were framing them and not from the infrastructure the infrastructure becomes generically available the logic of the support group has been revealed to be accessible to anyone including people pursuing these kind of goals so there are significant downsides to these changes as well as it's an amateur parade people come from all over the city people get all dressed up some people get less dressed up young and old dancing in the streets colorful characters and a good time is had by all of course in the current environment one need allude only lightly to the work of non state actors trying to influence global affairs and taking advantage of these this is a social map of the hijackers and their associates who perpetrated the nine eleven attack this is the part of the talk where i tell you what's going to come as a result of all of this but i'm running out of time which is good because i don't know right as with the printing press if it's really a revolution it doesn't take us from point a to point b it takes us from point a to chaos the printing press precipitated two hundred years of chaos moving from a world where the catholic church was the sort of organizing political force to the treaty of westphalia when we finally knew what the new unit was the nation state now i'm not predicting two hundred years of chaos as a result of this fifty fifty years in which loosely coordinated groups are going to be given increasingly high leverage and the more those groups forego traditional institutional imperatives like deciding in advance what's going to happen or the profit motive the more leverage they'll get and institutions are going to come under an increasing degree of pressure and the more rigidly managed and the more they rely on information monopolies the greater the the point here is not this is wonderful or we 're going to see a transition from only institutions to only cooperative framework it's going to be much more complicated than that but the point is that it's going to be a massive readjustment and since we can see it in advance and know coming my argument is essentially we might as well get good at it thank how do groups get anything done right how do you organize a group of individuals so that the output of the group is something coherent and of lasting value instead of just being chaos and the answer is i got them from flickr flickr is a photo sharing service that allows people to take photos upload them share them over the web recently flickr has added an additional function called tagging tagging was pioneered by del icio us and joshua schachter del icio us is a social book marking service tagging is a cooperative infrastructure answer to classification right if i had given this talk last year i couldn't do what i just did because i couldn't have found those photos shown in reverse chronological order and i was then able to go and retrieve them to give you that little slideshow now what hard problem is being solved here and it's in the most schematic possible view it's a coordination problem right there are a large number of people on the internet a very small fraction of them have photos of the mermaid parade how do we get those people together to contribute that work the classic answer is to form an institution right to draw those people into some pre arranged structure that has explicit goals and i want to call your attention to some of the side effects of going the institutional route first of all when you form an institution you take on a management problem right no good just hiring employees you also have to hire other employees to manage those employees and to enforce the goals of the institution and so forth you have to bring structure into place right you have to have economic structure you have to have legal structure you have to have physical structure and the economic framing of that problem is called coordination costs and a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output and that creates additional costs third forming an institution is inherently exclusionary you notice we haven't got everybody who has a photo you can't hire everyone in a company right you can't recruit everyone into a governmental organization you have to exclude some people and fourth as a result of that exclusion you end up with a professional class look at the change here we've gone from people with photos to photographers right we've created a professional class of photographers whose goal is to go out and photograph the mermaid parade or whatever else they're sent out to photograph when you build cooperation into the infrastructure which is the flickr answer you can leave the people where they are you take the problem to the individuals rather than moving the individuals to the problem you arrange the coordination in the group and by doing that you get the same outcome without the institutional difficulties you lose the institutional imperative you lose the right to shape people 's work when it's volunteer effort but you also shed the institutional cost which gives you greater flexibility what flickr does is it replaces planning with coordination and this is a general aspect of these cooperative systems you'll have experienced this in your life whenever you bought your first mobile phone and you stopped making plans you just said i'll call you when i get call me when you get off work right that is a point to point replacement of coordination with planning now able to do that kind of thing with groups to say instead of we must make an advance plan we must have a five year projection of where the wikipedia is going to be or whatever you can just say let 's coordinate the group effort and let 's deal with it as we go because we're now well enough coordinated that we don't have to take on the problems of and worst of all that figure at the bottom approximately ten photos per photographer is a it's mathematically true but it doesn't really talk about anything important because in these systems the average isn't really what matters what matters is this taken per photographer you can see here over at the end our most prolific photographer has taken around three hundred and fifty photos and you can see there's a few people who have taken hundreds of photos then there's dozens of people who 've taken dozens of photos and by the time we get around here we get ten or fewer photos and then there's this long flat is called a power law distribution it appears often in unconstrained social systems where people are allowed to contribute as much or as little as they like this is often what you get the math behind the power law distribution is that whatever 's in the nth position is doing about one nth of whatever 's being measured relative to the person in the first position so we'd expect the tenth most prolific photographer to have contributed about a tenth of the photos and the one hundredth most prolific photographer to have contributed only about one hundred as many photos as the most prolific photographer private or public it can be for profit or not profit it can be large or small but you get these resources together you found an institution and you use the institution to coordinate the activities of the group so the head of the curve can be sharper or flatter but that basic math accounts both for the steep slope and for the long flat tail and curiously in these systems as they grow larger the systems don't converge they diverge more in bigger systems the head gets bigger and the tail gets longer so the imbalance increases you can see the curve is obviously heavily left weighted here 's how heavily you go down to five percent you're still accounting for sixty percent of the photos if you go down to one percent exclude ninety nine percent of the group effort is actually here way to the left and that sounds strange to our ears but what ends up happening is that eighty percent of the contributors have contributed a below average amount that sounds strange because we expect average and middle to be about the same but they're not at all this is the math underlying the eighty twenty rule right whenever you hear anybody talking about the eighty twenty rule this is what's going on and the eighty percent zone is a no carrot and no stick zone the costs of running the institution mean that you cannot more recently because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination take on the work of those people easily in an institutional frame the institutional model always pushes leftwards treating these people as employees the institutional response is i can get seventy five percent of the value for ten percent of the hires great that's what i'll do the cooperative infrastructure model says why do you want to give up a quarter of the value if your system is designed so that you have to give up a quarter of the value re engineer the system don't take on the cost that prevents you from getting to the contributions of these people the system so that anybody can contribute at any amount so the coordination response asks not how are these people as employees but rather what is their contribution like right we have over here psycho milt flickr user who has contributed one and only one photo titled iraq and here 's the photo right labeled bad day at work right so the question is do you want that photo yes or no the question is not is psycho milt a good employee and the tension here is between institution as enabler and institution as obstacle when you're dealing with the left hand edge of one of these distributions when you're dealing with the people who spend a lot of time producing a lot of the material you want that's an institution as enabler world you can hire those people as employees you can coordinate their work and you can get some but when you're down here where the psycho milts of the world are adding one photo at a time that's institution as obstacle there has been a second answer which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by product of the operating of the system first goal of the institution immediately shifts from whatever the nominal goal was to self preservation and the actual goal of the institution goes to two through right so when institutions are told they are obstacles and that there are other ways of coordinating the value they go through something a little bit like the kubler ross stages of to the acceptance phase many many institutions are still in denial but we're seeing recently a lot of both anger and right because the fact that they have coordinated themselves to create cooperative value is depriving them of revenue you can follow this in the guardian it's actually quite steve ballmer now ceo of microsoft was criticizing linux a couple of years ago and he said oh this business of thousands of programmers contributing to linux this is a myth right we've looked at who 's contributed to linux and most of the patches have been produced by programmers who 've only done one thing you can hear this distribution under that complaint and you can see why from ballmer 's point of view that's a bad idea right we hired this programmer he came in he drank our cokes and played foosball for three years and he had one idea right the psycho milt question is was it a good idea without regard to institutional models so that's what i want to talk about today i'm going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples but always pointing to the broader themes what if it was a security patch what if it was a security patch for a buffer overflow exploit of which windows has not some several do you want that patch right that a single programmer can without having to move into a professional relation to an institution improve linux once and never be seen from again should terrify ballmer because this kind of value is unreachable in classic institutional frameworks but is part of cooperative systems of open source software of file sharing of the wikipedia i've used a lot of examples from flickr but there are actually stories about this from all over meetup a service founded so that users could find people in their local area who share their interests and affinities and actually have a real world meeting offline in a cafe or a pub or what have you when scott heiferman founded meetup he thought it would be used for you know train spotters and cat fanciers classic affinity groups the inventors don't know what the invention is number one group on meetup right now most chapters in most cities with most members most active stay at home moms right in the suburbanized dual income united states stay at home moms are actually missing the social infrastructure that comes from extended family and local small scale neighborhoods so they're reinventing it using these tools meetup is the platform but the value here is in social infrastructure if you want to know what technology is going to change the world don't pay attention to thirteen year old boys pay attention to young mothers because they have got not an ounce of support for technology that doesn't materially make their lives better this is so much more important than xbox but it's a lot less glitzy i think this is a revolution i think that this is a start by trying to answer a question that i know each of you will have asked yourself at some point or other and which the internet is purpose built to answer which is where can i get a picture of a roller skating mermaid really profound change in the way human affairs are arranged and i use that word advisedly it's a revolution in that it's a change in equilibrium it's a whole new way of doing things which includes new downsides in the united states right now a woman named judith miller is in jail for not having given to a federal grand jury her sources she's a reporter for the new york times her sources in a very abstract and hard to follow case and journalists are in the street rallying to improve the shield laws the shield laws are our laws pretty much a patchwork of state laws that prevent a journalist from having to betray a source this is happening however against the background of the rise of web logging web logging is a classic example of mass amateurization it has de professionalized publishing want to publish globally anything you think today it is a one button operation that you can do for free that has sent the professional class of publishing down into the ranks of mass amateurization and so the shield law as much as we want it we want a professional class of truth tellers it is becoming increasingly incoherent because the institution is becoming incoherent there are people in the states right now tying themselves into knots trying to figure out whether or not bloggers are journalists and the answer to that question is it doesn't matter because that's not the right question journalism was an answer to an even more important question which is how will society be informed how will they share ideas and opinions,1
112,ClayShirky_2009S.sph.wav,is the largest increase in expressive capability in human history now that's a big claim i'm going to try to back it up there are only periods in the last five hundred years where media has changed enough to qualify for the label revolution the first one is the famous one then a couple of hundred years ago there was innovation in two way communication conversational media first the telegraph then the telephone slow text based conversations then real time voice then about one hundred and fifty years ago there was a revolution in recorded media other than print first photos then recorded sound about the transformed media landscape and what it means for anybody who has a message they want to get out to anywhere in the world and i want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories about that transformation i'll start here you want to have a conversation in this world you have it with one other person if you want to address a group you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press that was the media landscape as we had it in the twentieth century and this is what changed this thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen is bill cheswick 's map of the internet he traces the edges of the individual networks and then color codes the phone gave us the one to one pattern and television radio magazines books gave us the one to many pattern the internet gives us the many to many for the first time media is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations that's one of the big the second big change is that as all media gets digitized the internet also becomes the mode of carriage for all other media because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something can now gather around and talk to each other as well and the third big change is that members of the former audience as dan gilmore calls them can now also be producers and not consumers every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well because the same equipment phones computers let you consume and produce it's as if when you bought a book they threw in the printing press for free it's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio if you pressed the right last november there was a presidential election you probably read something about it in the papers and there was some concern that in some parts of the country there might be voter suppression that is a huge change in the media landscape we're used to and it's not just internet or no had the internet in its public form for almost twenty years now and it's still changing as the media becomes more social it's still changing patterns even among groups who know how to deal with the internet well second story last may china in the sichuan province had a terrible earthquake seven point nine magnitude massive destruction in a wide area as the richter scale has it and the earthquake was as it was happening people were texting from their phones they were taking photos of buildings they were taking videos of buildings shaking they were uploading it to qq china 's largest internet service they were twittering it and so as the quake was happening the news was reported and because of the social connections chinese students coming elsewhere and going to school the last time china had a quake of that magnitude it took them three months to admit that it had happened now they might have liked to have done that here rather than seeing these pictures go up online but they weren't given that choice because their own citizens beat them to the punch and so a plan came up to video the vote and the idea was that individual citizens with phones capable of taking photos or making video even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens rather than from the xinhua news agency and this stuff rippled like wildfire for a while there the top ten most clicked links on twitter the global short messaging service nine of the top ten links were about the quake people collating information pointing people to news sources pointing people to the us geological survey one was kittens on a treadmill but that's the internet for in those first hours and within half a day sites were up and donations were pouring in from all around the world this was an incredible coordinated global response and the chinese then in one of their periods of media openness decided that they were going to let it go that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly the reason so many school buildings collapsed is that corrupt officials had taken bribes to allow those building to be built to less than code would document their polling places on the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques and would upload this to a central place and that this would operate as a kind of in front of these protesters in order to get them to go away essentially to say we will do anything to placate you just please stop protesting but these are people who have been radicalized because thanks to the one child policy they have lost everyone in their next generation someone who has seen the death of a single child now has nothing to lose and so the protest kept going and finally the chinese cracked down that was enough of citizen media and so they began to arrest the protesters they began to shut down the media that the protests were happening china is probably the most successful manager of internet censorship in the world using something that is widely described as the great firewall of china and the great firewall of china is a set of observation points that assume that media is produced by professionals it mostly comes in from the outside world comes in in relatively sparse chunks and it comes in relatively slowly and because of those four characteristics they are able to filter it as it comes into the but like the maginot line the great firewall of china was facing in the wrong direction for this challenge because not one of those four things was true in this environment the media was produced locally it was produced by amateurs it was produced quickly and it was produced at such an incredible abundance that there was no way to filter it as it citizen observation that citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes and so now the chinese government who for a dozen years has quite successfully filtered the web is now in the position of having to decide whether to allow or shut entire services because the transformation to amateur media is so enormous that they can't deal with it any other they were simply shutting down access to twitter because there was no way to filter it other than that they had to turn the spigot entirely these changes don't just affect people who want to censor messages they also affect people who want to send messages because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole not just but also to help insure the sanctity of the vote overall so this is a pattern that assumes we're all in this together what matters here the classic media problem from the twentieth century is how does an organization have a message that they want to get out to a group of people distributed at the edges of a network and here is the twentieth century answer bundle up the message send the same message national message targeted individuals relatively sparse number of producers very expensive to do so there is not a lot of competition this is how you reach people all of that is over we are increasingly in a landscape where media is global social ubiquitous and cheap now most organizations that are trying to send messages to the outside world to the distributed collection of the audience are now to this change the audience can talk back and that's a little freaky but you can get used to it after a while as people do but that's not the really crazy change that we're living in really crazy change is here it's the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other the fact that former consumers are now producers the fact that the we saw some of the most imaginative use of social media during the obama campaign and i don't mean most imaginative use in politics i mean most imaginative use technical capital it's social capital these tools don't get socially interesting until they get technologically boring and one of the things obama did was they famously the obama campaign did was they famously put up my barak obama dot com mybo com and millions of citizens rushed in to participate and to try and figure out how to help an incredible conversation sprung up there and then this time last year obama announced that he was going to change his vote on the foreign intelligence surveillance act he had said in january that he would not sign a bill that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying on american by the summer in the middle of the general campaign he said i 've thought about the issue more i've changed my mind i'm going to vote for this bill and many of his own supporters on his own site went very publicly berserk it was senator obama when they created it they changed the name later please get fisa right within days of this group being created it was the fastest growing group on mybo com within weeks of its being created it was the largest obama had to issue a press release he had to issue a reply and he said essentially i have considered the issue i understand where you are coming from but thing happened in the conversation people in that group realized that obama had never shut them it isn't when the shiny new tools show up that their uses start permeating society it's when everybody is able to take them for granted nobody in the obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group or make it harder to join to deny its existence to delete it to take to off the site they had understood that their role with mybo com was to convene their supporters but not to control their and that is the kind of discipline that it takes to make really mature use of this media media the media landscape that we knew as familiar as it was as easy conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast messages to amateurs is increasingly slipping in a world where media is global social ubiquitous and cheap in a world of media where the former audience are now increasingly full participants in that world media is less and less often about crafting a single message to be consumed by individuals it is more and more often a way of creating an environment for convening and supporting groups and the choice we face i mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard anywhere in the world isn't whether or not that is the media environment we that's the media environment we've got the question we all face now is how can we make best use of this media even though it means changing the way we've always done it thank you very much because now that media is increasingly social innovation can happen anywhere that people can take for granted the idea,1
113,ClayShirky_2010S.sph.wav,that's all it is but that's all that's needed because what it does is it takes the tacit information available to the whole population everybody knows where the violence but no one person knows what everyone knows and it takes that tacit information and it aggregates it and it maps it and it makes it that that maneuver called crisis was kicked off in kenya in january of two thousand and eight and enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough the programmers who created ushahidi decided they were going to make it open source and turn it into a platform it's since been deployed in mexico to track electoral fraud it's been deployed in washington d c to track snow cleanup and it's been used most famously in haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake when you look at the map this went from a single idea and a single implementation in east africa in the beginning of two thousand and eight to a global deployment in less than three years the story starts in kenya in december of two thousand and seven when there was a disputed presidential election and in the immediate aftermath of that election what okolloh did would not have been possible without human generosity and the interesting moment now the number of environments where the social design challenge relies on both of those things being true that is the resource that i'm talking about i call it cognitive surplus and it represents the ability of the world 's population to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate on large sometimes global projects now that free time existed in the twentieth century but we didn't get ushahidi in the twentieth century that's the second half of cognitive surplus the media landscape in the twentieth century was very good at helping people consume and we got as a result very good at consuming but now that we've been given media tools the internet mobile phones that let us do more than consume what we're seeing is that people weren't couch potatoes because we liked to be we were couch potatoes because that was the only opportunity given to us we still like to consume of course but it turns out we also like to create and we like to share and it's those two things together ancient human motivation and the modern tools to allow that motivation to be joined up in large scale efforts that are the new and using cognitive surplus we're starting to see truly incredible experiments in scientific literary artistic political efforts designing we're also getting of course a lot of lolcats lolcats are cute pictures of cats made cuter with the addition of cute captions and they are also part of the abundant media landscape we're getting now this is one of the participatory one of the participatory models we see coming out of that along with there are other candidates of course but lolcats will do as a general case someone who has done something like this however mediocre and throwaway has tried something has put something forward in public and once they've done it they can do it again who began blogging about it on her site kenyan pundit and shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence the government suddenly imposed a significant media and they could work on getting it better there is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work and as anybody who 's worked as an artist or a creator knows it's a spectrum you're constantly struggling to get on top is between doing anything has already crossed over now it's tempting to want to get the ushahidis without the lolcats right to get the serious stuff without the throwaway stuff but media abundance never works that way so before i talk about what is i think the critical difference between lolcats and ushahidi i want to talk about their shared source and that source is design for generosity it is one of the curiosities of our historical era that even as cognitive surplus is becoming a resource we can design around social sciences are also starting to explain how important our intrinsic motivations are to us how much we do things because we like o do them rather than because our boss told us to do them or because we're being paid to do this a graph from a paper by uri gneezy and aldo rustichini who set out to test at the beginning of this decade what they called deterrence theory and deterrence theory is a very simple theory of human behavior you want somebody to do less of something add a punishment and they'll do less of it simple straightforward commonsensical also largely untested and so they went and studied ten daycare centers in haifa israel and they studied those daycare centers at the time of highest tension which is pick up time and so weblogs went from being commentary as part of the media landscape to being a critical part of the media landscape in trying to understand where the violence was pick up time the teachers who have been with your children all day would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back meanwhile the parents perhaps a little busy at work running late running errands want a little slack to pick the kids up daycare centers represented by the black line they said we are changing this bargain as of right now if you pick your kid up more than ten minutes late we're going to add a ten shekel fine to your bill boom no ifs ands or buts and the minute they did that the behavior in those daycare centers changed late pick ups went up a fine what they did was communicate to the parents that their entire debt to the teachers had been discharged with the payment of ten shekels and that there was no residue of guilt or social concern that the parents owed the teachers and so the parents quite sensibly said ten shekels to pick my kid up late what could and okolloh solicited the explanation of human behavior that we inherited in the twentieth century was that we are all rational self maximizing actors and in that explanation the daycare had no contract should have been operating without any constraints from her commenters more information about what was going on and the comments began pouring in and okolloh would collate them she would post them and she quickly said it 's too much i could do this all day every day and i can't keep up there is more but that's not right they were operating with social constraints rather than contractual ones and critically the social constraints created a culture that was more generous than the contractual constraints so gneezy and rustichini run this experiment for a a dozen weeks run the fine for a dozen weeks and then they say okay that's it all done fine really interesting thing happens nothing changes the culture that got broken by the fine stayed broken when the fine was removed not only are economic motivations and intrinsic motivations in designing these kinds of situations is to understand where you're relying on the lolcats and this is i think the range that matters both of these rely on cognitive surplus both of these design for the assumption that people like to create and we want to share is the critical difference between lolcats is communal value it's value created by the participants for each other is everywhere every time you see a large aggregate or shared publicly available data whether it's photos on flickr or videos on youtube or whatever this is good i like lolcats as much as the next guy maybe a little more even but this is also a largely solved problem i have a hard time envisioning a future in which someone is saying where oh where can i find a picture of a cute cat by contrast is civic value it's value created by the participants but enjoyed by society as a whole the goals set out by ushahidi are not just to make life better for the participants but to make life better for everyone in the society in which ushahidi is operating and that kind of civic value is not just a side effect of opening up to human motivation it really is going to be a side effect of what we collectively make of these kinds of there are hours a year of participatory value up for grabs that will be true year in and year out the number of people who are going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects is going to grow and we can see that organizations designed around a culture of generosity can achieve incredible effects without an enormous amount of contractual overhead a very different model than our default model for large scale group action in the twentieth century going to make the difference here what dean kamen said the inventor and entrepreneur kamen said free cultures get what they celebrate we've got a choice before us we've got this trillion hours a year we can use it to crack each other up and we're going to do that that we get for free in seventy two hours they launched ushahidi ushahidi the name means witness or testimony in swahili is a very simple way of taking reports from the field whether it's from the web or critically via mobile phones and sms aggregating it,1
114,CliffordStoll_2006.sph.wav,second book nor am i going to talk about why i believe computers don't belong in schools when they cast bells they write inscriptions on them so i wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells and i look at it i'm asking myself why am i here so at this time i'd like to tell you the words inscribed upon the hayes hall tower bells all truth is one in science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind from darkness to light from narrowness to broad mindedness from prejudice to tolerance i feel that there's a massive and the argument is so obvious to anyone who 's hung around a fourth grade classroom doesn't need much talking about but i guess i may be very wrong about that and everything else that i've said so don't go back and read my dissertation it probably has lies in it as well said that i outlined my talk about five minutes ago and if you look at it over here the main thing i wrote on my thumb was the future i'm supposed to talk about the future yes right and my feeling is asking me to talk about the future is bizarre because i've got gray hair and so it's kind of silly for me to talk about the future in fact here i'm honored by the invitation and thanks i would love to talk about stuff that i'm interested in but unfortunately i suspect that what i'm interested in won 't interest many other people i think that if you really want to know what the future 's going to be if you really want to know about the future ask a technologist a scientist a physicist no don't ask somebody who 's writing code no if you want to know what society 's going to be like in twenty years in fact don't ask just any kindergarten teacher ask an experienced one the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation i nor i suspect do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring certainly all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there to me things aren't the future i ask myself is what's society is going to be like the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on screen time never gone bowling together happening and the change that is happening is not one that is in software but going to talk about i'd love to talk about it it 'd be fun but i want to talk about what i'm doing now what am i doing now oh the other thing that i think i'd like to talk about is right over here right over here is that visible what i'd like to talk is one sided things i would dearly love to talk about things that have one side because i love mobius loops i not only love mobius loops but i'm one of the very few people if not the only person in the world that makes klein bottles right away i hope that all of your eyes glaze over this is a klein bottle first off my badge says i'm an astronomer i would love to talk about my astronomy for those of you in the audience who know you roll your eyes and say yup i know all about it it's one sided it's a bottle whose inside is its outside it has zero volume and it's non orientable it has wonderful properties if you take two mobius loops and sew their common edge together you get one of these and i make them out of glass and i'd love to talk to you about this but i don't however the d in ted of course stands for design just two weeks ago i made you know i've been making small medium and big klein bottles for the trade but but i suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer in non gray atmospheres and polarization of light in jupiter 's upper atmosphere are the number of people who 'd fit in a bus shelter so what i've just made and i'm delighted to show you first time in public here this is a klein bottle wine although in four dimensions it shouldn 't be able to hold any fluid at all it's perfectly capable of doing so because our universe the cool one that was a month of my life although i would love to talk about topology i'm not going to going to mention my away last summer had collected photographs of me as mothers will do and i looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me standing well sitting in to talk about that it sent me back soon after that i found in another picture that she had a picture of me over here of course is me this man is robert moog the inventor of the moog synthesizer who passed away this past august robert moog was a generous kind person it would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened a musician who took time from his life to teach me a sophomore a freshman at suny buffalo he'd come up from trumansburg mentoring me he'd come up and spend hours and hours with me he wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school bob 's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us anyone who 's a musician has been profoundly influenced by say what i'm about to do what i'm about to do i hope you can recognize a distorted sine wave almost a triangular wave upon this hewlett packard i can get to this place over here right kids kids is what i'm going to talk about is that okay it says kids over here that's what i'd like to talk about for me at least i don't have a big enough head so i think locally and i act locally i feel that the best way i can help out i caught the guys and they turned out to be working for what was then the soviet kgb and stealing information and selling it and i'd love to talk about that and it is to help out very very locally so ph d this and degree there and the how come you ain't over here on the front lines i strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do not just show up to class every now and then teach a solid week okay i'm teaching three quarters time but one of the things that i've done for my science students is to tell them look i'm going to teach you but twenty years with my help of course and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope measured the speed of light we were off by twenty five percent how many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light in addition to that we've measured the speed of sound i'd love to measure the speed of light here i was all set to do it and i was thinking aw man i was just going to impose upon the powers that be and measure the speed of light and i'm all set to do it i'm all set to do it but then it turns out that to set up here later i find computer security frankly to be kind of boring it's tedious could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation and all of you know the wave equation is of any wave is a constant when the frequency goes up the wavelength comes down wavelength goes up frequency goes down if we have a wave here over here that's what's interesting what they didn't tell you in physics in eighth grade physics but they should have and i wish they had was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound or light you get a constant and that constant is the speed of sound the first time you do something is know its frequency well that's easy i've got a frequency counter right here set it up to around a above a above a there's an a more or less now so i know the frequency it's one point seven six it's science the second time it's engineering need now is to flip on another beam and the bottom beam is me talking right so anytime i talk you'd see it on the screen over here and as i move this away from the source you'll notice the spiral the slinky moves we're going through different nodes of the wave coming out this way those of you who are physicists i hear you rolling your eyes but bear with me to measure the wavelength all i need to do is measure the distance from here one full wave over to here from here to here is the wavelength of sound so i'll put a third time it's just being a technician here here let 's go back to mister the frequency is one point seven six kilohertz or one thousand seven hundred and sixty the wavelength was zero point two meters let 's figure out what this is do something i do something else one point seven six zero point two over here is three hundred and fifty two meters per second if you look it up in the book it's really three hundred and forty three but here with kludgy material and lousy drink to measure the speed of sound to comes to what i wanted to say go back to this picture of me a million years ago and i'm like oh my god i'm studying physics landau lipschitz resnick and halliday i'm going home for a midterm a riot 's going on there's a riot going on on campus and the police are chasing me i'm walking across campus cop comes and looks at me and says you you're a student and a tear gas canister the size of a pepsi i go running across campus quick as i can i duck into behind me climb up go past this place where i see a pendulum ticking and i'm thinking oh yeah the square root of the length is proportional to its period i keep climbing up go back i go to a place where a dowel splits off there's a clock clock clock clock the time 's going backwards because i'm inside of it i'm thinking of lorenz contractions and i climb up and there's this place way in

115,CorneilleEwango_2007G.sph.wav,story i suspect a lot of people here have the same question i have how can we i did it myself if i know when i was young that killing elephant i'm destroying biodiversity i would not many many of you have seen the talents of africans but there are few who are going to school to biomedical science to be a doctor i didn't succeed i was having my inscriptions my admission to biology many are dying because of all those kind of pandemics hiv malaria poverty not going to school but many of them are just here because they don't have money and they can't go even to university and i said no way i'm not doing it my family 's poor my area don't have better health care i want to be a doctor that means three years and i start getting old i say oh no i continue so i did tropical ecology and plant botany when i finished i went to ituri forest for my internship it's where i really getting passion with what i'm doing right english i start speaking english learning english about a year ago i speak french and i grew up with french so my english is franglais now i'm standing in front of you doing botany and wildlife conservation that time the ituri forest was created as a forest reserve and also plants and the training center there was built around the scientific congolese staff and so the okapi faunal reserve protects number i think that is the largest number of elephant we have right now in protected area in congo it has also chimpanzees and it okapi faunal reserve because of this beautiful creature that is a forest giraffe i think you guys know it quite well here we have giraffe but through evolutions we have this forest giraffe that it has also some beautiful primates thirteen species highest diversity we can find in one single area in africa and it has the ituri forest itself about one thousand teaching assistant at my university because i accomplished with honor but i didn't like the i got was very poor and i wanted to be from to a training center and a research center with the end of was completely difficult to do and to achieve when kabila started his movement to liberate congo so mobutu soldiers started in the western congo in an area around here and then went to university in kisangani moving and retreated so they started fleeing from the east to the west and the okapi faunal reserve is so there was a road from goma somewhere here and coming like this so they might go through pass through okapi faunal reserve congo has five of sites of protected area and okapi faunal reserve is one of them so soldier was fleeing in the okapi faunal reserve way they looted everything torture wars oh my god you can't believe every person was looking his way where to go we don't know and it was for us young the first time really we hear the language of what was happening they were killing people they were doing whatever they want because they have power who have been doing that young children child soldiers you can't ask him how old he is because he has guns but i was from the west working in the east i even that time was not speaking and after i finished i went to this area the ituri forest but what i've been doing when i was about fourteen and when they came they looted everything you can't speak lingala because lingala was from mobutu and everyone speaking lingala is soldier and i was from the same area my friends said we are leaving because we are a target but i'm not going to the east because there i don't know swahili i if i go i will be killed i can't go back to my area it's more than one thousand kilometers i stayed after they looted everything we have been doing research on botany and we have a small herbarium of four thousand five hundred sheets of plants we cut we dry and we packed them we mounted them on a so that we start them for agriculture for medicine for whatever and for science the study of the flora and the change of the forest that is people moving around that's even pygmies and this is a bright guy person and pygmies i've been working with him about ten years and with soldiers they went to the forest for know how to track elephant in the forest he have been attacked by leopard and they abandon him in the forest they came to told me and what i did i gave him just antibiotics that we care for that tuberculosis and fortunately i grew in my uncle 's house and my father was a soldier and my uncle was a fisherman and so on and what of important things i think all of you here have killed a lot five millions of congolese have gone because of that they use it to make cell phone and it have been in that area all over in congo extraction and good big business of the and what i did for the first war after we have lost everything i have to save something even myself my life and life of the staff i buried some of our new vehicle engine i buried it to save it and some of equipment went with them on the top of the canopy to save it he 's not collecting plants he 's going to save our equipment with the material that's left because they wanted to destroy it to burn it they didn't understand it they didn't go to school it and that is me going to hurrying to uganda try to save that four thousand material with people them on the bikes bicycles and after that we succeeded i housed that four thousand material the herbarium of makerere university and after the war i have been able to bring it back home so that also a poacher what i've been doing from fourteen to seventeen was i was assisting the second war came while we didn't expect it with friends we have been sitting and watching match football and having some good music with when it started i think so it was so bad we heard that now from the east again and it's going fast this time i think kabila will go in place of as he did with mobutu and the reserve was that's the powerful men we have to meet and to talk to them what's the regulation of the reserve and what is the regulation of the parks and they can't do what they are doing so we went to meet them that is gold mining so we started talking with them convincing them that we are in a protected area there is regulations that it's prohibited to do logging mining and poaching specifically we don't think so we have to do it because to let our movement advance i say no way you are not going to do it here we started talking with them and i was negotiating tried to protect our equipment tried to protect our staff and the villages of about one thousand five hundred people and we continued but i was doing that negotiating with them sometimes we are having meeting and they are talking with and whatever they were killing poaching hunting in the forest bring it in the main city to get access to the and i'm there sometimes they talk to my own language that is lingala i hear it and what strategy they are doing what they are planning sometimes they are having helicopter to supply them with ammunition and so on they used me to and i was doing counting what comes from where and where and where i this equipment my satellite phone my computer and a plastic that i hide it in the forest and every time daily after we have meeting what we have whatever i go i write a short email send it i don't know how many people i my address i sent the message what is going about the progress of the war and what they are planning to do they started suspecting that what we do on the morning and the afternoon it's on the news bbc rfi something might be going on and one day we went for we went to meet the chief commander he had the same iridium cell phone like me and he asked me do you know how to use this i said i have never i don't know and i had mine on my pocket so it was a chance that they trusted me a lot they didn 't they was on me so i was scared and when we finished the meeting i went to return it in the forest and i was but finally i got myself involved around seventeen to twenty years i became sending news doing whatever reporting daily to u n to unesco to our institution in new york the first two rebellions they killed all animals in the zoo we have a zoo of fourteen okapis and one of them was pregnant and during the war after a week of heavy war fighting in the area we succeeded we had the first okapi this is the only trouser and after a week we celebrated the birthday of that okapi they killed elephant just fifty meters area where the zoo where okapi was born and i was mad i oppose it that they are now going to dissect it until i do my report and then i see the chief commander and i succeeded the elephant just decayed and what we are doing after that that was the situation of the some money i was paid one hundred and fifty dollars i to rebuild the herbarium because we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants wildlife conservation society more dealing with plants i started this with seventy dollars and start fundraising money to where i've been going i had opportunity to go all over where herbarium for my african material is and they supported me a bit and i built this now it's doing work to train young congolese and also what one of the speciality we are doing my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity and what the impacts of the ituri forest is uptake carbon this is one of the study we are doing on forty hectares plot where we have to see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions and that is i think it's difficult for me this is a very embarrassing talk i know i don't know where to start where to finish it when i was thinking to come here you people now we are talking about reconstitution rebuild africa but is gun industries a tool to is it a game i think we even so i did it and for three to four years i went to university for three times i see the war like a game like soccer football everybody is happy but see what it's doing see what going in darfur now we say oh my god see what the wars in rwanda that's because of the language of guns i don't think that someone may blame google,1
116,CraigVenter_2005G.sph.wav,but as we look what's out there we've barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet and on the order of ten million viruses less than five thousand microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago and so we decided to do something about it and we started the sorcerer ii expedition where we were as with great oceanographic expeditions trying to sample the ocean every two hundred miles we started in bermuda for our test project then moved up to halifax working down the u s east coast the caribbean sea the panama canal through to the galapagos then across the pacific and we're in the process now of working our way across the indian ocean it's very tough duty we're doing this on a sailing vessel in part to help excite young people about going into science the experiments are incredibly simple we just take seawater and we filter it and we collect different size organisms on different filters and then take their dna back to our lab in rockville where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every twenty four hours and with doing this we've made some amazing discoveries for example it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments it turns out almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photo receptors and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication from one site from one barrel of seawater we discovered one point three million new genes and as many as fifty thousand new species we've extended this to the air now with a grant from the sloan foundation we're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums we filter through some simple apparatuses we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in new york city and we're in the process of sequencing all that at the present time just on the data collection side just where we are through the galapagos we're finding that almost every two hundred miles we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean some of these make logical sense in terms of different temperature gradients so this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures red being warm blue being cold and we found there's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence and these vary tremendously from region to region maybe not surprisingly in the deep ocean where it's mostly blue the photo receptors tend to see blue light what i'm going to tell you about in my eighteen minutes is how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was we assembled all the data and we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are are we just discovering new members of known families or are we discovering new families and it turns out we have about fifty thousand major gene families but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families so we're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes components and life on this planet when we look at the so called evolutionary tree up on the upper right hand corner with the animals of those roughly twenty nine million genes we only have around twenty four thousand in our genome and if you take all animals together we probably share less than thirty thousand and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families i view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution and we think in a gene centric view maybe going back to richard dawkins ideas than in a genome centric view which are different constructs of these gene components synthetic dna the ability to synthesize dna has changed at sort of the same pace that dna sequencing has over it's only ten years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free living organism that of haemophilus influenzae that took a genome project from thirteen years down to four months from mycoplasma genitalium and we have really nice t shirts that say you know i heart my genitalium this is actually just a microorganism so we started doing transposon mutagenesis transposons are just small pieces of dna that randomly insert in the genetic code and if they insert in the middle of the gene they disrupt its function so we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those non essential genes but it turns out the environment is very critical for this and you can only define an essential or non essential gene based on exactly what's in the environment and we got these overlapping circles and we found only one hundred and seventy three genes common to all thirteen organisms the pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of three hundred and ten or so the only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes and we had to do this in a cassette based fashion we found that synthesizing accurate dna in large pieces was extremely difficult ham smith and clyde hutchison my colleagues on this an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a five thousand base pair virus in only a two week period that was one hundred percent accurate in terms of its sequence and its biology it was a quite exciting experiment when we just took the synthetic piece of dna injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden that dna started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria this was not the first synthetic virus a polio virus had been made a year before we can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours so in the last decade a large number of genomes have been added most human pathogens this is a case where the software now builds its own hardware and that's the notions that we have with biology and i think it's important to keep reality in mind versus what happens with people 's imaginations basically any virus that's been sequenced today that genome can be made and people immediately freak out about things about ebola or smallpox but the dna from this organism is not infective so even if somebody made the smallpox genome that dna itself would not cause infections the real concern that security departments have is designer viruses and there's only two countries the u s and the former soviet union that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents if that research is truly discontinued there should be very little activity on the know how to make designer viruses in the future i think single cell organisms are possible within two years and possibly eukaryotic cells those that we have are possible within a decade so we're now making several dozen different constructs because we can vary the cassettes and the genes that go into this artificial chromosome the key is how do you put all of the others we start with these fragments and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome this is derived from an organism deinococcus radiodurans that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed a couple of plants several insects and several mammals including the human genome it reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about twelve to twenty four hours after its chromosomes are literally blown apart this is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation the glass started to burn and crack while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier here 's an actual picture of what happens the top of this shows the genome after one point seven million rads of radiation the chromosome is literally blown apart and here 's that same dna automatically reassembled twenty four hours later it's truly stunning that these organisms can do that doing that after these genomes are synthesized the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome so we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues for example from the third organism we sequenced methanococcus jannaschii it lives in boiling water temperatures its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from co two it captures back from the environment so we know lots of different pathways thousands of different organisms now that live off of co two and can capture that back so instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere converting that into biopolymers or other products we have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen also there's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolising methane and dupont has a major within a short while i think there's going to be a new field called combinatorial genomics because with these new synthesis capabilities these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day and therefore as with all biology you get selection through screening whether you're screening for hydrogen production or chemical production or just viability to understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach we're trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight photosynthesis by oxygen and we have an oxygen insensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process it's on the order of several hundred we just got a grant from the gordon and betty moore foundation to sequence one hundred and thirty genomes this year we're also combining cellulases the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol future engineered species could be the source of food hopefully a source of energy environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry let me just close with ethical and policy studies we delayed every major religion participated in this it was actually a very strange study because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life so it must be ok the only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this right now the sloan foundation has just funded a multi institutional study on this to work out what the risk and benefits to society are and the rules that scientific teams such as my own as a side project from environmental organisms so the rate of reading the genetic code has changed should be using in this area and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward these are complex issues except for the threat of bio terrorism very simple issues in terms of can we design things to produce clean energy perhaps revolutionizing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes thank you very much,1
117,CraigVenter_2010P.sph.wav,the vaccine area synthetic genomics and the institute are forming a new vaccine company because we think these tools can affect vaccines it's been a fifteen year quest just to get to the starting point now to be able to answer those questions to diseases that haven't been possible to date things where the viruses rapidly evolve such with rhinovirus wouldn't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds or more importantly hiv where the virus evolves so quickly the vaccines that are made today can't keep up with those evolutionary changes we can't see co two we depend on scientific measurements for it and we see the beginning results of having too much of it but we can see pre co two now floating on the waters and contaminating the beaches in the gulf we need some alternatives for oil we have a program with exxon mobile to try and develop new strains of algae that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere because it's very difficult to eliminate multiple genes from a cell you can only do them one at a time we decided early on that we had to take a synthetic route or from concentrated sources make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries to make normal gasoline and diesel fuel out of co two those are just a couple of the approaches and directions that we're taking even though nobody had been there before to see if we could synthesize a bacterial chromosome so we could actually vary the gene content to understand the essential genes for life that started our fifteen year quest to get here before we did the first experiments we actually asked art caplan 's team then at the university of pennsylvania to undertake a review of what the risks the challenges the ethics around creating new two years off as a side project to sequence the human genome but as soon as that was done we got back to the task at hand we're here today to announce the first synthetic cell in two thousand and two we started a new institute the institute for biological energy alternatives where we set out two goals one to understand the impact of our technology on the environment and how to understand the environment better and two to start down this process of making synthetic life to understand basic life in two thousand and three we published our first success so ham smith and clyde hutchison developed some new methods for making error free dna at a small level our first task was a five thousand letter code bacteriophage a virus that attacks only cell made by starting with the digital code in the computer building the chromosome from four bottles of chemicals so that was the phage phi x one hundred and seventy four which was chosen for historical reasons it was the first dna phage dna virus dna genome that was actually sequenced so once we realized that we could make five thousand base pair viral sized pieces we thought we at least have the means then to try and make serially lots of these pieces to be able to eventually assemble them together to make this megabase chromosome so substantially larger than we even thought we would go after initially so there were several steps to this there were two sides we had to solve the chemistry for making large dna molecules and we had to solve the biological side of how if we had this new chemical entity how would we boot it up activate it in a recipient cell so we had two teams working in parallel one team on the chemistry and the other on trying to be able to transplant entire chromosomes to get new cells when we started this out we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem which is why we chose the smallest genome and some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome to a much larger one and we can walk through the reasons for that but basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from whereas the larger faster growing cell takes only two days so there's only so many cycles we could go through in a year at six weeks per cycle and you should know that basically ninety nine so one of the most important publications we had was in two thousand and seven carole lartigue led the effort to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome from one bacteria to another i think philosophically that was one of the most important papers that we've ever done because it showed how dynamic life was and we knew once that worked that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those we didn't know it was going to take us several years or more to get there in two thousand and eight we reported the complete synthesis of the mycoplasma genitalium genome a little over five hundred thousand letters of genetic code but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome we think in part because of its slow growth and then part cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms to keep these events from happening it turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into had a nuclease an enzyme that chews up dna on its surface and was happy to eat the synthetic dna that we gave it and never got transplantations but at the time that was the largest molecule of a defined structure that had been made but part of the synthesis had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished using yeast putting the fragments in yeast and yeast would assemble these for us it's an amazing step forward but we had a problem because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast so in addition to doing the transplant we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome out of the eukaryotic yeast into a form where we could transplant it into a recipient cell so this is the first self replicating species that we've had on the planet whose parent is a computer our team developed new techniques for actually growing cloning entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast when we did these experiments though we could get the chromosome out of yeast but it wouldn't transplant and boot up a cell that little issue took the team two years to solve it turns out the dna in the bacterial cell was actually methylated and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme from digesting the dna so what we found is if we took the chromosome out of yeast and methylated it we could then transplant it further advances came when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes from the recipient capricolum cell so last fall when we published the results of that work in science we all became overconfident and were sure we were only a few weeks away from being able to now boot up a chromosome out of yeast it also is the first species to have its own website encoded in its genetic code because of the problems with mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth about a year and a half ago we decided to synthesize the much larger chromosome the mycoides chromosome knowing that we had the biology worked out on that for transplantation and dan led the team for the synthesis of this over one million base pair chromosome but it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end and it set us back three months because we had one error out of over a million base pairs in that sequence so the team developed new debugging software where we could test each synthetic fragment to see if it would grow in a background of wild type dna and we found that ten out of the eleven one hundred thousand base pair pieces we synthesized were completely accurate and compatible with a life forming sequence we narrowed it down to one fragment we sequenced it so accuracy is essential there's parts of the genome where it cannot tolerate even a single error but we'll talk more about the watermarks in a minute this is a project that had its inception fifteen years ago and then there's parts of the genome where we can put in large blocks of dna as we did with the watermarks and it can tolerate all kinds of errors took about three months to find that error and repair it and then early one morning at six a m we got a text from dan saying that now the first blue colonies existed so it's been a long route to get here fifteen years from the beginning we felt one of the tenets of this field was to make absolutely certain we could distinguish synthetic dna from natural dna early on when you're working in a new area of science you have to think about all the pitfalls and things that could lead you to believe you had done something when you hadn 't and even worse leading others to believe it so we thought the worst problem would be a single molecule contamination of the native chromosome leading us to believe that we actually had created a synthetic cell when it would have been just a contaminant so early on we developed the notion of putting in watermarks in the dna to absolutely make clear that the dna was synthetic the first chromosome we built in two thousand and eight the five hundred thousand base pair one we simply assigned when our team then we called the institute tigr were involved in sequencing the first two genomes in history we did haemophilus influenzae and then the names of the authors of the chromosome into the genetic code but it was using just amino acid single letter translations which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet so the team actually developed a new code within the code within the code so it's a new code for interpreting and writing messages in dna now mathematicians have been hiding and writing messages in the genetic code for a long time but it's clear they were mathematicians and not biologists because if you write long messages with the code that the mathematicians developed it would more than likely lead to new proteins being synthesized with unknown functions so the code that mike montague and the team developed actually puts frequent stop codons so it's a different alphabet but allows us to use the entire base pairs of genetic code the first one actually contains within it this code for interpreting the rest of the genetic code so the remaining information in the watermarks contain the names of i think forty six different authors and key contributors to getting the project to this stage and we also built in a website address so that if somebody decodes the code within the code within the code they can send an email to that address so it's the smallest genome of a self replicating organism that of mycoplasma genitalium clearly distinguishable from any other species having forty six names in it its own web address and we added three quotations because with the first genome we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound than just signing the work so we won 't give the rest of the code but we will give the three quotations so the first is to live to to fall to triumph and to recreate life out of life it's a james joyce quote the second quotation is see things not as they are but as they might be so it's a quote from the american prometheus book on robert oppenheimer and the last one is a richard feynman quote what i cannot build i cannot understand so because this is as much a philosophical and as soon as we had these two sequences we thought if this is supposed to be the smallest genome of a self replicating species advance as a technical advance in science we tried to deal with both the philosophical and the technical side we've done asking for ethical review pushing the envelope on that side as well as the technical side this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community in the policy community and at the highest levels of the federal government even with this announcement as we did in two thousand and three that work was funded by the department of energy so the work was reviewed at the level of the white house to classify the work or publish it and they came down on the side of open publication which is the right approach we've briefed the white house we've briefed members of congress we've tried to take and push the policy issues in parallel with the scientific advances so with that i would like to open it first to the floor for questions yes in the back can we explain how significant this is i'm not sure we're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is it's significant to us perhaps it's a giant philosophical could there be even a smaller genome could we understand the basis of cellular life at the genetic level change in how we view life we actually view it as a baby step in terms of it's taken us fifteen years to now be able to do the experiment we wanted to do fifteen years ago on understanding life at its basic level but we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools and we're already starting in numerous avenues to use this tool we have at the institute ongoing funding now from nih in a program with novartis to try and use these new synthetic dna tools to perhaps make the flu vaccine that you might get next year because instead of taking weeks to months to make these dan 's team can now make these less than twenty four hours so when you see how long it took to get an h one n one vaccine out we think we can shorten that process quite substantially,1
118,CynthiaSchneider_2009G.sph.wav,these programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society in afghanistan people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program and you don't necessarily have to have your own tv set people watch it all over the country also in public places but it goes beyond watching because also part of this is campaigning people become so engaged that they have volunteers just like political volunteers anyway who fan out over the countryside i'd like to ask you what do these three people have in common very conservative part of the country and here she relates in the documentary film afghan star how her friends urged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy but she also confides that she knows that members of the taliban are actually sms ing votes also took risks and put herself out to compete in the poet of the millions competition i have to say her husband backed her from the start but her tribe and family urged her not to compete and were very much against it but once she started to win then they got behind her again it turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value and she's out there her poetry is about women and the life of women in society so just by now you'd think that american idol would introduce a measure of americanization but actually just the opposite is happening by using this engaging popular format for traditional local culture it actually in the gulf is precipitating a revival of interest in nabati poetry also in traditional dress and dance and music and for afghanistan where the taliban banned music for many years it is reintroducing their traditional music they don't sing pop songs they sing afghan music and they also have learned how to lose gracefully without avenging the winner no small thing and the final sort of formulation of this american idol format which has just appeared in afghanistan is a new program called the candidate who is a contestant indeed a finalist in the poet of the millions competition which is broadcast out of abu dahbi and seen throughout the arab world and in this program people present policy platforms that are then voted on many of them are too young to run for president but by putting the issues out there they are influencing the presidential race so for me the substance of things unseen is how reality tv is driving reality thank you in this contest people have to write and recite original poetry in the nabati form of poetry which is the traditional form and lima sahar was a finalist in the afghan star singing competition now before i go any further yes i know it all began with britain 's got talent but my point in discussing this is to show you i hope i'll be able to show you how these merit based competitions with and the arab world with the uae how they're changing tribal societies not by introducing western ideas but by being integrated into the language in those places it all begins with,1

1,0h-zjBukYpk.wav,huh huh OK OK hello this is xxx man eleven here for review of XMen Origins Wolverine throat cleaning starring Hugh Jackman Liev Schreiber Danny Houston Ryan Reynolds Will I am and Taylor Kitsch and yes I just watched this a week ago most specifically July 27 so who ran off for over 3 dollar theater showings now the title of the movie basically says it all the movie shows the origins and backstory of famed Xman member Wolverine now Im not even gonna sugar coat this this movie frustrated me to such an extreme extent that I was loudly exclaiming why at the end of the film my reason Im a comic book fan that like to see comic book characters treated responsibly that huh before we go on with that I must say that this had a surprisingly decent cast strange since one of my biggest grapes with the Xman series was and always is the xxx now Hugh Jackman was always the best choice to play Wolverine I will admit that and in my opinion he carried the movie fine you know nothing great but you know he did it hes a star of the movie nothing special he carried it um also Liev Schreiber or Schreiber um I like calling him Liev Schreiber um is Victor Creed otherwise best known as Sabertooth which shes not called once in the whole movie which is a smart move since you know you have to be real comic book fan to get what hes name is supposed to be but its pretty selfexplanatory but going on um I actually think that Liev Schreiber is a good actor and he almost looks exactly the same as this character in Defiance I mean it was like he was too lazy to take off the costume or something now other performances are borderline OK but the two big character appearances in this movie are easily Deadpool and Gambit um Deadpool being Ryan Raynolds and Gambit being played by Taylor Kitsch Taylor Kitsch yes Ryan Raynolds has eleven minutes of screen time maximum actually I liked him a lot and I thought he made a good actor for the dead poor character now hes seen at the beginning that really sold me I mean that was impressive I liked that scene where he had a swords in there and theres bunch of people that are gonna shoot him boom boom boom boom take him down take him down bam bam bam bam bam take that with my magical swords,0

3,1iG0909rllw.wav,HiIm OliviaUm this is my New Moon review So first of all Im not a xxxI have read the books um and I thought they were average Lets face it they are really not master pieces I thought Twilight directed by Catherine Hardwicke was actually really rather enjoyable um I mean obviously it had its flaws but cinematicly I thought it was good quite good It wasit was enjoyable I wasnt thinking on hearing that Chris Weitz was gonna start the New Moon because of the destruction that was Phillip Pullman the Golden Compass I thought that film was awful and I I didint really know what to expect from New Moon um in terms of his direction Overall New Moon was it was OK just average the thing is its a very good translation of the book Its very very loyal to the book and I really appreciate that loyalty um however it is this loyalty to the original source that gives it its flaws Because people have read the book to understand what was going on And the book is not necessarily the most thrilling book ever I mean the entire xxx is Bella Swan Kristen Kristens Stewards character mobbing around completely depressed It wasnt really the best the most thrilling read ever Ill say that So overallNew Moon even with the bigger better budgets huh it was still too long the angsty too angsty moments withdrawn out to the max as far as thay can go and the script it left all the key plots and emotion from the characters to be exposed through dialogue I think it was Empire magazines review of New Moon that said that Kristen relied heavily on the tactic of tactic of blinking a lot which she really does do a lot but at the same goes for Rob Pattinson as Edward and Taylor Lautner as Jacob they do a lot of frowning Im a manly man and I frown For the moment in this the whole cinema was laughting and you knew you shouldnt be laughing My favorite scene would definately be the Volturi um then my wins on screen wiskers I mean they were really worn in a lots which is a shame because I thought xxx really rather good and um Michael Sheen as Aro as well he was rather enjoyable to watch And I think the Volturi that was my exciting bit of the entire film The rest of the film was just watching Kristen just mob around and that was really boring See I said it was a really rushed review I mean Im really busy at the moment um so I hope they have got more videos coming up seeing but yes,0
4,2WGyTLYerpo.wav,much say that I really enjoyed Cowboys and Aliens There was a lot of fun You guys dont know what youre gonna go and see when you go walk into the movie called Cowboys and Aliens If youre expecting some artsy serious Oscar contender than youre wrong The only Oscar that I can even thing of is maybe like best cinematography Because the cinematography in this movie is great and maybe best visual effects coz the visual effects are pretty cool But again you you cant expect a huge like surreal mind bender from the movie called Cowboys and Aliens yo youre gonna see cowboys fighting aliens and you get it here and its satisfactory The action is really intense which surprised me I didnt expect the action to be so intense Theres some really intense action scenes especially the scene when the aliens first invade That scene is like crazy It gave me chills i its a lot of fun the action is really cool The aliens are really cool OK Im not gonna spoil what they look like one thing I like with the aliens is that a they are not just weak links that hide behind the technology They are huge theyre really strong and theyre kind of scary looking I didnt expect that and also I like how its kind of upfront to show them to us instead of hiding them like showing a little like an arm on scene or something no they just straight up show it to us And I really enjoyed that I it was really cool when they did that coz the aliens were really cool looking Daniel Craig does a very good job here He kind of channels the man with no name Clint Eastwood and a lot of people have been saying that I think he does a great job at what he does Hes a really bad ass is really really hard core He doesnt take crap from anybody and he does a really good job Also his innocent accent is pretty convincing Harrison Ford is also good Hes he gives an entertaining performance as the kind of like the leader the of the town hes like an outlaw leader but everyones kind of afraid of him and he at first hes just kind of like grumpy old guy but he becomes more likeable his guts developed more as more likeable character so you can care about him and alsoum Olivia Wild shes pretty good shes beautiful and shes not a bad actor shes actually pretty good Shes in everything nowadays Dont flaw There are some flaws here and there but theyre not huge glaring flaws but they are noticable flaws Such as sometimes the aliens in the western setting do look a little goofy but I was kind of expecting that um theres a plot twist Im not gonna reveal I wasnt a huge fan of it I just thought it was kind of stupid and sometimes it kind of veers into cliche action movie territory like a movie called Cowboys and Aliens a lot of people would think would be kind of like crazy but sometimes it just veers entirely cliche action movie territory again not a huge flaw but its there and its noticable Overall I really enjoyed Cowboys and Aliens and Im gonna give it an eight out of ten It was really fun a very good time and I definately recommend you check it out in theaters coz thats th,0
5,2iD-tVS8NPw.wav,hey welcome to stuffwelikecom video review of the Green Lantern stuff we like before I went in to see the Green Lantern Ive been hearing all these like critics basically just trashing this movie left and right I wasnt entirely sure why exactly I didnt read what they had written about the Green lantern and what they overall their thoughts were on this movie and still I I Ive yet to as of this review but I at the same time I do wanna just say that I enjoyed this movie I enjoyed it for what it was you know its a huge sort of spectacle movie that is great for this summer time you know this is a movie that youre gonna go out and see and you wanna see it in 3D because I I would actually say this probably is one of the first movies this year that Ive seen this year that you wanna see in 3D especially for just the opening portion it looks really good and the rest of it does look good as well and I just had fun watching this movie its not like a dark movie or anything its very much a light hearted so its perfect for kids as well as just like teenagers as well who just wanna see a lot of explosions and some crazy stuff and you know going into it or these watching the trailers before head I was really kind of hesitant about seeing the Green lantern in the first place because it looks like a cartoon Im not really a huge fan of having like all these 3D characters because I think why not just make this you know movie this live action movie and talk cartoon thats really the route that youre gonna go and it seemed like they were gonna go that route but I think there was also some sort of like um tone within the actual um powers of the green lantern and himself and that you can basically think up of anything and you can project that into the real life and I think having this sort of superpower almost this power to just imagine anything kind of just um helped me get passed that you know these are all CGI characters and set this is a playground and their imaginary playground and anything can happen anything that what also made the film exciting because you dont entirely know whats coming next the entire movie is about building up towards this ultimate battle of this force that is so powerful and they dont even know how to defeat it its that powerful you know its the darkest force ever right but then you kind of like walk out of the movie and youre like well I I get what happened I understand what happened but what what would you do for Green Lantern movie 2 that would be even like worth while now because I mean if hes able to do all of this sort of stuff like how youre supposed to really put up a force that can push him to the next level or or destroy him at the same time during the credit sequence they do have a scene that basically explains what potentially speaking the Green lantern 2 might be about and it does kind of a lea helps alleviate what that whole was is about fighting the ultimate enemy within this first movie and that the threat is still there potentially speaking so its kind of interesting to see um where theyre gonna be going with that Im looking forward to it Ive got to say its not like the Green lantern is the next Batman begins or or the Dark nighter,0
6,5W7Z1C_fDaE.wav,Moli Elfman coming to you with the review for Red State probably one of the ballsiest probably one of the ballsiest fims od Sundance 2011 Um as really the best way to describe this film is its big its bold its strong it makes big powerfuls statements it doesnt hold back everything from the way its being released to the performances and to the story itself is absolutely ovrt the top impressive and really well done Its a huge break through for Kevin Smith Its completely different from anything weve ever seen him do before John Goodman absolutely amazing Melissa Leo will have you creeped out to your inner core with her tiny little smile Its so well done For all of those people who are hating on it I dont know what they are complaining about it Its a horror film ia a true sense and it is absolutely horrifying Um it is it is definately one of those films thats not gonna be easy for you to find Its being released in a very interesting way Whenever it comes to your town do not miss it Its extremly well made its extremly dare I say fun to watch in a really messed up kind of way and even now its a horror film its definately got some fun Kevin Smith moments in it for you to laugh with um Yeap absolutely not to be missed,0
7,6Egk_28TtTM.wav,Hi everybody my name is Anthony Aranda from Kids first I just got finished watching an excellent movie called Mars Needs Moms This movie is all about Milo who goes on a big adventure to help his mother to get away from the alians And the alians arent really good mothers so thats why they looked down on at Earth to find good mothers to take care of the alian siblings And my favorite characters in the movie would have to be Milo Milos mother and Gribble I liked Gribble because he helped Milo get Milos mother away from the alians Which I thought was awesome And my favorite part in the movie was when Milo has to save Gribble Because the alians in the uniforms were gonna shoot Gribble And when they were about to shoot Gribble Milo came in swung in and then saved the day And the there are some bad people in this movie and that is the alians and the uniforms They are bad because they listen to the Supervisor The Supervisor wants everything around here She dosent care about enything enyone ever says And I would recommend this movie for ages 3 and up because it is a good movie and it depends what age you are and how you to how you feel like see the movie Like for example my brother is five years old and he didnt think this movie was scary at all I am eight years old and I thought it was really s kind of scary And that was my example And I think I why I would be scared is because I would feel scared and kind of sad if I lost my own mother But it all turns out great in the end Go out and see this movie when it premiers on Disney DVD Oops it looks I got done Bye,0
8,6_0THN4chvY.wav,Hey guys the first film I wanted to talk about is the new Winnie the Pooh movie It came out a couple of weeks ago a went to see it just because as a little kid my parents would would show me the many adventures of Winnie the Pooh and those little um that film came out in 1977 and it was a Vignette various Pooh adventures based on the books um and I never went to see Tiggers big move or Piglets big move in a Tigger movie and Pooh and a Heffalumps or whatever the other film was in the early 2000s but I went to this one coz when I saw the trailer it remainded me of the original film and and so I was kind of curious to see maybe if that was what Disney was going for and it definately was what thay were going for um I havent seen the 1977th film Vignettes for a while but I bet if you put them next to the new film that the style would be similar enough that you wouldnt be able to really tell what the difference is um its its great if you remember that was old films would be great for kids too the story is pretty simple weve got great jokes um funny jokes that the kids would get um I love the scene where Eeyore and Pooh think that Owl is getting sick because he says issue and they think he is saying at you um that was probably part of the trailer that got me to go and see the movie beacuse I wanted to see how they could frame that so um if you havent seen Winnie the Pooh and you like family films go see it Its a great one I definately recommend it So more next time See ya,0
9,73jzhE8R1TQ.wav,snap Hey everybody um so today Im going to be reviewing I am number four the movie I have already reviewed the book and if you have not seen a video please check it out because I can always use the views so yeah if you havent seen the movie or read the book I am number four is xxx about a a species of alians called Lorians who have escaped to Earth because their planet was invaded by the Mogadorians another spicies of alians um There are only a handful Lorians left like maybe like nine children and their guardians called Sequin and Dundel Mogadorians have Folden too Hard to track them down and and isolate them But to make it harder for them the Lornians place a charm on their children so thay can always be killed in a certain order and um we in the movie The main character is number four who goes by the name of John Smith and for John the stake has been raised because number three just died hes next so he and his sequin Henry xxx tehy settle in a small town called Paradise Ohio which is where our story takes place um So there are things that I liked about the movie better than I liked about the book and vice verse It wasnt like It wasnt like oh the book was so much harder than movie maybe because number four was not my all time favorite book it was a good book but but um I wasnt crazy about it so yeah and the movie was pretty good in my opinion so I liked the movie because it did a good job of explaining the back story in the book good job of explaining thing with Lorain the Mogadorians the numbers they and they kind of stuck to the book of it so I like that and but xxx were too Hollywood for me like th this thing isnt really a big deal but um I I ddint like the fact that John had an iphone because think about it if you if your top priority is survival than why would you be worried about having the latest technology you know what I mean So since were not really sure what their financial situation is they could be like scraping by or they could be totally rich but my opinin like he shouldnt have an iphone he shouldnt care about the latest trends so thats really what the lieutenant xxx I thought it was all too commercial in that aspect um Like I said it wasnt big deal and you probably dont think so but you know just one of those little things that that hurt you for some reason you know what I mean um another thing that did bother me were the kissings um John does meet a girl in paradise and in some hearts like tr l,0
10,7JsX8y1ysxY.wav,music all right I just watched the Watchman yes I was watching the Watchman um lets see it was a few words describe it um graphics were incredible um some really good acting some really sucky acting um blue penis youre like what what did you just say um yeah blue penis all right let me explain OK um the guy thats blue in the movie Dr Manhattan um hes naked so this was pretty funny coz people were like eating popcorn and you see the first show and people you hear like this this ripple effect of whispering oh my god is that a is that am I looking at this right what I thought that was really funny um there couldve been less blue nudity because what was weird was the fact that in part of the movie hes wearing like a blue um overall flong thing medal flong thing so I was like why not wear the whole whole time you know why why you got to go command on us it was funny though hes funny um theres other nudity in it it was like people that arent blue um thats all right I dont know its kind of weird naked up on spaceship I dont know classic superhero kind of getting on kind of thing all right so enough of the nudity lets hear about the story lets talk about the acting um but what sucked what was bad was Malin Akerman the girl who plays the Silk Spectre II um junior lady girl I know I I mean she looked fan fantastic she looked phenomenal she looked like a superhero but she acted like power ranger and theres a vast difference between those two things but Ill tell you what Ill tell you who made the movie who was just kick ass 100 of time was the guy that played our Rorschach I dont know if Im saying that right Rorschach ror Rorschach I think it is a Rorschach but anyways he was awesome hes the little guy with the white mask and implants on it that change all the time I thought that was very cool um he was awesome like he was incredible the other guy that did a really good job was um Jeffrey Dean Morgan the guy who played the comedian he did a very good job very dark um I really liked sicko guy but um he did a really good job at acting I was very impressed so overall its its like a blend of youve got alternative history youve got multi multiple different time periods mixed together um but different genres and its very very interesting um but its extremely dark I warn you its a very very dark and um theres not in my opinion there wasnt very much of a balance between sort of like the good evil kind of thing and it seemed like everything was sort of overwhelmingly bad um so at the end theres not really a whole lot of redeeming value that I think you come up with but um you know overall it was good I have to say,0
11,8OtFthrtaJM.wav,hey hows it going guys I went to go see the Adjustment Bureau Friday so I thought Id give you guys a review for those of you who may have not seen it and maybe wished to see it right just as a little synopsis the main character played by Matt Damon he falls in love with the girl in a bathroom which is where all great relationships should start um you know these two people fall in love with each other but theres this higher organization called the adjustment bureau and they try to adjust adjust their lives each other persons life to keep them away from each other because that what it says in the plan this plan that they are following so Matt Damon um desides not to do that and he wants to live with the girl anyways and so you know hes trying to run away from the adjustment bureau and theyre theyre chasing him and theres running theres a lot of doors opening and closing and theres fedoras and just its very its very chaotic at the end of this movie I literally said out loud what que what is this movie that I am seeing what is this I do not understand this movie but theres a reason for that theres a reason for why I was confused first off the commercial makes the terrible terrible mistake of saying that it is more thought provoking than Inception thanks a lot commercial the entire time I was constantly comparing it to Inception but I must say those are some pretty big shoes to fill so I thought maybe it has a chance I I should give it a shot you know I was just waiting for Joseph Gordon Levitt to come out just jump out any time and say its a paradox now the only suspensful part that I found in the first thirty minutes of the movie was when Matt Damon first discovers the Bureau in the first place you know ther theres a lot of confusion theres scuffling he hes trying to run away from them end up catching him and then they explain their purpose to him as to why they are there which kind of just ruins the suspense right there because if youve got some convenient guy in a fedora to just tell you oh yes we are the adjustement bureau and this is what we do you know its just kind of ruins the suspense and now Im not Im not excited anymore interestingly it turned out to be more of a romantic comedy than it was a thriller um you know it had some interesting writing you know it was it was funny at times Matt Damon is a you know hes a pretty funny guy but just aside from that they really dropped the ball on the suspensful parts overall overall it had far too many plot holes and just not enough depth to be interesting I have to say my favorite character in the entire movie is the character Thompson if you go see the movie youll see him but hes just the creepiest old guy youll ever see in your life he stands over people when theyre asleep just staring at them just imagine if youre in your bed sleeping and getting your dream on whatever you do you know and theres just someone standing at the foot of your bed just,0
12,8d-gEyoeBzc.wav,reaveal one it now um Im gonna give the reasons why I like him but mostly Im gonna give the reasons of why I dont think hes gonna be a classic in the same way as the first movie Predator or Aliens um which I think Rodrigez was going for he th th he always said that he was gonna do the sequel um he wanted this to be um th the Predator equivalent of aliens um as um you know as aliens was to alien um and Im gonna really point out why that I dont think he really pulled he pulled that off um why was a mistake really to try and do that um but I did enjoy it so um Im gonna point out the stuff I did like there were some action scenes in it um the characters were well developed um not all of the characters but um I would say that um there was theres good there were four good characters in there um I I liked agent Brodys character I thought he was um well developed you know well drawn out character someone you cared about I liked the girl who was the Israeli sniper I thought she was the number one well drawn character um I liked the Russian guy Juri I think his name was um you cared you there was enough in there for you to care about him and xxx was an interesting character um he had some funny he had a few one lines that was quite quite funny yeah once unfortunately um I think in the writing somewhere they they just werent um developed enough fear to care about them um and that includes is it Topher Graces I think I think his name was includs his character um I just didnt think it was well developed enough and um I also I I include in that Laurence Fishburnes character as well who I think Rodrigez when he wrote the mo wrote the movie was going for a Marlon Brando apocalipse now type of character but he actually found um when hes seen come up it slowed the movie down um and this is the problem um with Predator to Predators compared to Predator Predator is really well paced movie and it picks up speed and never lets go ev even in the same xxx where they they slow you know they meant to have some dialogue and and talk about whats going on yo you know it felt the movie slowed down wheres it in the middle of this when when they they with um Laurence Fishburne character it does slow down a great deal I didnt really feel um the inclusion of his charater was necessary um it couldve been written out I know he was there to um give out the main characters some information on who these new Pre Predators are and what theyre about but um,0
13,8qrpnFRGt2A.wav,the instant watch and um I have to admit I was watching this I purposly put it on because I figured it would be something that would be stupid that I could fall asleep in the middle of and not miss too much coz it was late at night I was tired just wanted something to watch while I was falling asleep so I didnt didnt have very high expectations for this movie and I um pretty much it pretty much met my low expectations for the most part because I three major complaints I have about this movie um biggest one is the CGI effects were just terrible and um the story was pretty weird um and again I I if I had to pay closer attention I might have followed it more and might have been it might have made more sense um um this movie this movie um by half way through I was checking the time and saw that this movie was two hours long which I mean for a movie about JI Joe ninty minutes is enough Ok I dont need a three hour mini xxx about JI Joe but thats just me I thought that two hours was way too long for this movie and the last big thing was um just the the it it I know its about JIJOe you know obviously its gonna be about the army but it just felt like um like um military propaganda kind of like you know it fell like I was watching one of those army of one commercials sometimes um um but I can understand that I mean its about the army even if its a um you know fantacy version of the army of course its too much of course its gonna be making them look good just fine I I guess um but the funny thing is um I mean funny thing is despite as despite everything bad about this movie I ended up half way liking it and thats because about half way through the movie I realized that this is just its really just a cartoon if you look at it as a live action movie you youre gonna be disappointed but if you look at it as a cartoon which is pretty much mostly is with all the CGI FX and and there is a lot of it I mean this movie makes um makes um Star wars pretty close I mean its its about that level star war is pretty close as far as just CGI heavy like this time its what its like human face and everything around that face is cartoon CGI computer effects,0
14,9J25DZhivz8.wav,hey internet I saw Despicable me last night in XD or real D 3D however you wanna call it this movie is adorable the plot of Despicable me follows Gru an evil villain who has kind of being slipping as he gets older only able to pull off minor highs and steals and hes getting showing up by um bigger and newer villains so his next plan is to steal the Moon unfortunatelly a new evil nemesis has stolen the shrink ray which he needs to steal the Moon so Gru uses or adopts three little girls to help infiltrate his nemesiss fortress to steal the shrink ray the plan gets side tracked when Gru actually starts caring about these youngsters as more than just part of his evil plot this movie is just too adorable there were some really good things about this movie the voice acting excellent the visuals were great this was probably the best 3D movie Ive seen in a long time coz it actually used 3D Toy Story had elements of it but this movie played with 3D and um different ways to come at you out of the screen so I liked that a lot the voice acting in this was incredible Steve Carell voices Gru and Russell Brand actually really impressed me with his old man voice for the doctor of I couldnt I couldnt even believe it was Russell Brand I kept I was listening bored and there was maybe one time when I thought I actually heard Russell Brand himself but otherwise I thought he was excellent as for 3D I say yes theres one scene in this movie that makes 3D entirely worth it and thats when theyre in the amusement park and some people might think that theres a lot of cheap tricks but theres a roller coaster scene and if you are um get a little bit motion sick you might not wanna see it in 3D because youll feel like youre on this coaster I mean my stomach was almost going wohu as we went down the big drop I thought it was really cool that was a great effect there was a lot of cheap child humour which everyone can relate to and I I always think thats hilarious but what made this movie really fun was some of the adult humour jabs for instance semispoiler when Gru goes into the bank and the evil part of the bank to get a loan,0
15,9T9Hf74oK10.wav,hi youre watching Watch this fucking movie My name is Jenn and I will be reviewing Never let me go for you today so today is the day of the Oscars and I was just thinking about all the nominees and um particularly the movies that I feel like shouldve gotten nominated but didnt and Never let me go is actually one of those movies I saw Never let me go a while back actually so its not completely fresh in my mind but I do remember a lot of it and I do remember um what I thought about it I think a lot of people are really split about this movie theres a certain deadpan nature to it it was a pretty slow movie for the most part and it was it was thoughful but there are you know therere critics of movies that are sometimes too thoughful in a way and I think that would never let me go a lot of critics said that it relied too much on the audience to um explore the themes in the film and you know tightly so I guess which um in a way a lot of the themes in Never Let me go which were very profound and deep they werent fully explored and I think that the movie did rely on you to kind of figure it out and kind of deal with those ideas by yourself but regardless I thought it was a very good movie the story surrounds threee main characters two boys and one I mean two girls and one boy sorry but two girls are played by Carey Mulligan and Keira and Keira Knightley and the boy is played by Andrew Garfield those three are some of the best young actors of today Carey Mulligan I mean shes been in an Education she and everything she does she has so much grace to it and so much fluidity and Keira Knightley I mean everybody knows her from the Pirates of the Carribean but I mean in her other works like Pride and Prejudice shes just been realy fantastic and Andrew Garfield of course everybody knows him form the Social Network and hes also going to be the new Spiderman so look out for that that should be interesting but anyways they did um they did act very well and again the story surrounds these three kids and theyre growing up in the boarding school and you dont exactly know what is going on I think it takes place sometime um its I dont think its present day but its um its someone modern I would say its not its not like a period piece or anything but um these three kids and you see them as children they are growing up in a boarding school and you dont exactly know whats going on theres something off about the boarding school theyre the children are told that their health is supposed to be paramount and that above all things that they should be healthy and that sort of becomes the theme throughout their whole childhood it is just taking care of themselves and preparing themselves to go out into that outside world and I think early on the twist is revealed Never let me go is actually based on a novel and if youve read the novel and I,0
16,9c67fiY0wGQ.wav,hi the Smurfs are back and in 3D I like this movie at first I thought the movie would appeal more to younger audience but I actually found myself enjoying the movie and laughing if you havent seen the Smurfs TV series the movie is about how a group of little blue people come to New York after trying to escape from the evil Gargamel they befriend a couple named Patrick and Grace since they let them stay at their appartment if youre wondering how the Smurfs will avoid Gargamel and get back to their magical world watch the movie to find out I think the movie really depicted the liveliness of New York City while since Im a New Yorker myself I also liked how the storyline of the movie worked together smoothly the movie also delivers many meaningful messages the Smurfs learn the importance of team work and Patrick learns to believe in himself and follow his heart I also thought some parts of the movie were funny for example um Gargamels cat facial expressions theyre so hilarious and similar to xxx person with that I recommend this film to children six and up it is a fun family film parents will find themselves laughing as they reminisce they childhood and children will like the movie since the Smurfs are so adorable and they go on thrilling adventures this has been a review from Gabriela Choo for Kids first bye,0

18,Af8D0E4ZXaw.wav,Before I get to the substance of my review Id like to clear up a couple of things First the fact that Im wearing on of my new Marvell geek shirts as Im giving this review is a coincidence and secondly Im going to throw out the spoiler alert I cant express my thoughts and feelings about this movie adequatly without describing some specific things in the third act of the movie which is spoilerific so so if you havent seen the movie and you stick it out through this entire movie video and I end ups saying something that ruins it for you youve been warned Now to the subject of this review Green Lantern starring Ryan Reynolds Blake Lively Peter Sarsgaard Mark Strong among others this was a big event for DC and for Warner Brothers and for superhero fans everywhere Big for Warner Brother because it had a huge production budget and was potentially seen um as the first step of a series of xxx towards justice league movie It was widely believed that a sucess of Green Lantern movie would lead Warner Brothers to adapt the Flash and Wonder woman among possibly others and put them in a justice leage movie with the ritual Batman and Superman So not only that this movie have to deal with the burden of telling its own selfcontained story and setting up its own inevitable sequels it had to deal with the expectations of potentially setting up all that others stuff And how did it do Yeah not good to all the green lantern fans out there I am so sorry I say that for two reasons First because someone owes you an appologie and Warner Brothers is never gonna give you one And secondly because as a Marvell geek I have experienced my fair share of disappointments over the last decade and I can genuinly symphatize with you Before I get to the negatives of the movie let me list off a few of the positives i love Jeffrey Rush and Michael Clarke Duncan as the voice actors They do a great job with their roles They are great additions I also love the casting of Mark Strong as Sinestro Hes perfect for that role and um finally a particular stand out scene for me was the fighter jet sequence It was by far my favorite action seen in the movie I thought it was really well put together and um I thought it worked worked pretty well Um and in fact in spite of all the negatives Im about to mention I thought the movie was working for a while for about the first third um but at the end of act one two significant things happened Hactor Hummand arrives and starts chewing scenery like its a two dollar steak and how Jordan flies off to the green lantern core planet oh and the movie starts sequel baiting These two developments together caused what was up to that point a noble effort to start falling apart at the seams and it was painful to watch I dont even know why I really should begin with listing off the negatives but Im going to start with a few of the superficial things The acting ranges from mediocrity to hamfisted from the live action actors but I cant really blame them for that because a few of them are acting for entire sequences entire lantern for green screens This is Star Wars prequal territory The acting is not that bad but still its that kind of movie making and and you know I wasnt expecting good acting out of,0
19,BI97DNYfe5I.wav,Hello friends Im doing another movie review last night a group of friends and myself went to go see the Green Hornet and it was actually pretty good um I was expecting Seth Rogan to be a little bit more serious in this movie but he wasnt He was the same old goofy Seth Rogan that we all know um but IT was still a good film um I think that I mean I had fun with it So to me thats a pretty good movie um um I am a little familiar with the Green Hornet um Ive read some of the comics and um because of that I was expecting Seth Rogan to maybe try to be a little bit more serious but he wasnt But you know thats OK I guess um I still had fun with it um the car the black beauty that was amazing all the guns even the car over there that was really sweet And all the action scenes were great the special effects were great and the guy who played Kato whose first name is J The actors name is J J something um he was good he played Kato perfectly and he did a great job um The acting was was pretty good and the action was good um I would definatelly recommend you go see it in theaters coz take a bunch of your friends because you you guys will have a good time Youll have fun and youll laugh it is funny its a funny movie Lots of Lots of laugh out loud moment I guess you could say but um Yeah go check it out Its one its one to check out in theaters I would say um snif but yeah so the Green Hornet it was OK I expected a little bit more seriousness but It was still good It get it gets pretty serious and um fun at the end too pretty intense at the end so thats my review so Thats it yeah Im gonna turn this off,0
20,BXuRRbG0Ugk.wav,Cowboys and Aliens metaphoricaly speaking is like one of those NFL teams that has the talent to be a super bowl champion but instead ends up being a wild cart team that just gets dismissed in the first round of playoffs yeah job pretty well done I mean it wasnt a bad year but there was a lot of potential left on the table And that describes Cowboys and Aliens pretty well Though I guess I should be grateful that it turned out as good as it did because given all the strikes that it had going against before wonder production it could have been much much worse Fortunally some good decisions were made before the camara started rolling Jon Favreau was hired to direct and Daniel Craig and Harisson Ford were cast as the lead roles but this probably had the unfortunate side effect of raising bad expectations to unreasonable levels When I saw the first trailer back in November of last year this movie immediately shot up near the top of my list of must see movies for 2011 The final product ultimately doesnt live up to the high order of that first trailer but its still a pretty enjoyable ride if you go in wanting to see a bunch of cowboys battle a bunch of aliens yeah youll pretty much get your fill but if thats all youre looking for youll actually miss the best thing about this movie Jon Favreau is probably not the guy that I would hire if I was looking for a director for an action movie I mean yeah hes a competent action director hes action sequences are certainly a lot better than the incoherent impossible to follow slope that we see in a typical Michael Bay movie but its action isnt particulary memorable I mean lets look at his track record Hes directed three big action movies in the last three years Two Ironman films and now this And the action wasnt the most memorable thing about any on those movies The ironman films are fondly remembered mostly for Robert Doweny Jr Not the action And the same thing has more or less happened here yeah thats right the movie called Cowboys and Aliens Daniel Craig steels the whole damn show hes playing a variation of the iconic man with no name character that was made famous by Clint Eastwood and now that Ive seen him in the role I cant imagine any other current actor trying ot pull it off He is perfect from start to finsih Harisson Ford is a long for the ride and having a blast as the second lead and the cast is pretty well rounded out with suppordting performance from guys like Sam Rockwell as the Doc Theyre all playing cliched stock western characters but I really dont care that the characters are walking cliches when they are this well done and the actors do such a good job of carrying of their particular arcs Cowboys and Aliens problem is the screenplay Six different people got writing credit for this movie and the results are exactly what you would expect the story,0
21,Bfr499ggo-0.wav,Lets talk Sex and the City 2 snap Most of the critics are right It just really heh but if you loved the series and you also liked xxx the first movie than youre still gonna have fun just go in with low expectaions If your pet pees Carrie wore those horrendous hideous hats they were not catching the ball and a few times I didnt like the fashion A few times I thought that was bumped way over the top and they kind of looked like clowns The desert scene was one of them um but you know the premise is OK and there are a few nice moments The movie is really too long they shouldve just cut the wedding in the beginning its not even necessary for the plot I also thought that desert riding the camels all troup stopped looking like clowns But also not necessary but I love the moment with Charlotte in the closet because who hasnt experienced that although I ran to the bathroom and um It was just fun to see your old friends again so if your a fan Id do it but dont expect much the writing isnt as good as the first the storyline isnt this good but if you dont expect a lot I think youll enjoy it And thats it Now off to bed,0
22,BioHAh1qJAQ.wav,Im a big fan of the first Tron Um i thought this is the perfect time to have a Tron sequel because um in at the beginning of the 1980s people thought that computers can do every every anything and everything and now technology actually does anything and everything because it kinda controls our lives so it was the perfect time for a Tron sequel unfortunately um the writers and I were not exactly on the same wavelength lip smacking but I will say that the first third of this movie is amazing its the best summer movie Ive seen all year but you know the pacing is so good it gets straight into the story you have lots of uh references to the first movie you know you have recurring characters you have new characters that actually have a connection to the old ones and once Sam Flynn enters the grid you know the soundtrack draws you in the special effects look amazing uh they dont waste a lot of time on exposition because the minute the soundplane enters the grid he is put in the games and let me tell you the games look great all those action sequences in involving the games were great to watch um the cho the choreography of the fights the special effects I was so happy to be back in the grid that I wasnt really thinking about the story or where the story was going but then sam flynn meets his father and Tron basically turns into a star wars prequel after that one disconnection then that happens at that point because uh the old flynn the original flynn starts going on and on about these kinds of aliens not aliens artifical intelligence i guess that he found on the grid and he just pulls them the writers just pull this out of their ass and the whole movie becomes about these crazy i i isos theyre calles ISOs and its just like or why do we need these things it doesnt make any sense because anyway they get purged at some point because when the old Flynn finds these things whatever they are theyre so wise and naive kinda like Navi now that I think about it clue which is the program that he created in the first movie kinda pulls a bunny in the boiler moment in the sense that he turns into a crazy jealous psycho stalker bitch and clue has to be one of the most idiotic villains ever cause what is a what is clue clue is a computer program and he wants to take all the programs that are now under his control and put them in the real world for some kind of freaky teleportation or whatever so basically you have this computer program that wants to create a physical army on the planet and its like youre a computer program okay if you want to take over the world using real people its the worst way you could possibly do that infiltrate some computer system somewhere and detonate some nukes or something,0
23,BvYR0L6f2Ig.wav,Hello there you tube Michel xxx again and Im gonna do my Ive decided to do two of reviews in one day since Ive got nothing to do much So here we go the long awaited movie review of Final Destination 3 So here we go Now this movie um re unites the two direct creators of the first movie Jim Vong and Glan Morgan Jim Vong comes to act in the third one again I was very impressed with his work on the first one I thought the first one was creative and inventive and really brought something new to the cinema the second one was direced by David Arales whos also directing the fourth one the Final Destination coming out now whats that again now but the second one it didnt in some ways take to the next level but in some ways the first one was better so it was just about equal to the first one so here we are with the creators of the first one Final Destination 3 So lets get into this review and Ill tell you why what I thought Ill tell you what I thought of it So anyway here we go The plot of the movie this time its basically exactly the same as first two movies but different characters So here we go um Mary Elizabeth Winstead portraits Wendy Christensen and Ryan Merriman portraits Kevin Blake and guess the second name I dont know anyway thats not the review Wendy has a premonition that the roller coaster at her and her friends who are in the amusement park has a the preminition is that the roller coaster is gonna crash which is of course exactly the same as the first two it happenes and it prep it crashes she she and a few people get of the ride and of course what happenes is exactly the same as the first two where um the death starts pickin up people one by one and you know before they reach their Final Destination and they have to try to stay alive and avoid death as much as possible So thats the basic plot of Final Destination 3 now um but some of the brush plot that you mey think I hated this movie but youre wrong actually I did I really liked it Ill tell you why first First Im gonna get into the acting which was much much better than the second one the second one had wooden acting in some places Im sorry I did like the second one but there most of the actors we so witty exeption may be the police cop and Kim Kimberly but the rest of the actors were so wooden They were just theyre just they just why acting what theyre doing anyway I dont know they do seem they need to learn acting better anyway The further I went acting was much much better in the second one anyway Mary Elizabeth Winstead oh my god she is a teriffic shes nice looking as well but she is also a teriffic actress Olso this is one of the best performances Ive ever seen out of hers Ive not seen one bad movie that shes been into I mean this is the only movie Ive actually seen with her in it and Die hard 4 Teriffic in that but Mary Elizabeth Winstead I must say she is a teriffic and beautiful and talented acress She displays the emotional distress of her character so well you actually feel for her character You know shes going through the stress and you feel sorry for her and you wanna help her,0
24,Ci-AH39fi3Y.wav,I just got back from the midnight showing of Saw 5 and I have to review before I go to sleep because Im still excited about it But I just want to let you guys know that the first part of this review will not have any spoilers and also you dont have to worry about it being ruind for you And the second half of this video is going to have spoilers but I will warn you beforehand so you can close out the video and than after you see Saw 5 you can come back and watch the spoilers Also be very vary of the comments underneath the video I would suggest that if you havent seen Saw 5 you shouldnt go to the comments because people are going to be commenting about the ending and stuff So if you havent seen Saw 5 dont check out the comments on this video either So hopefully you got all that now lets talk about Saw 5 As some of you might not notice I was extremly excited about Saw 5 OK all of you knew that obviously So I was you know really hyped up and excited to see it and I have to say that it was definately better than the Saw 4 not exectly what I was expecting but it was still really really really good and um its just made me really really excided for Saw 6 Now there were two plots going on in this movie One of them was great and the other one was completely irrelevant as far as I can tell The great plot was with Hoffman tying up all loose ends and stuff and the irrelevant plot was with five rendom strangers kind of like in Saw 2 who um you know have to go through these traps and stuff But I totally missed how it tied it to the movie at all and Im pretty sure thats because it didnt tie in to the movie at all So that was really bizzare and I didnt care about the characters at all because they werent you know introduced well really So it was just really really strange but luckily Hoffmans story um was a really really really awesome and um it totally made up for that so thats OK Of course as everyone knows the tag line of Saw 5 was you wont believe how it ends And I guess thats sort of true because I sure didnt see the end coming Im not gonna spoil it dont worry But the end was really you you know the Saw movies are known for it bigh twist endings and stuff but I thought the best part of Saw 5 was the storyline like in general Everything leading up to the ending the ending was not you know crazy shocking or anything like usual It was not a real huge Saw twist moment um so you know that was a little surprising I guess Thats not to say that the ending wasnt good because it really was but it was not exectly what I was expecting and se seriously everything leading up to the end was better than the ending which is still good because the movie is good Saw 5 has left like no closure at all at the end of the movie and it pretty much just left the door wide open for Saw 6 which obviously is already scheduled to come out next year So you know we knew it was coming and everything but man oh man it really left the door open and it didnt even you know try to close it at all like the wind isnt gonna blow it over or anything Its just open But like I said the plot of Hoffman and everything that was really really awesome and it fit very well into the Saw series in my opinion So congratulations to the writers for that But Ill smack them in the face for the other irrelevant plotline and dont know what the hell they were thinking It was pretty much just and excuse to put traps in the movie because it was literally completely irrelevant But whatever Like I said I loved the Hoffmans storyline so you know I guess it balances out David Hackl directed this movie and it was his first time directing a movie I think in general,0

26,Dg_0XKD0Mf4.wav,I mean it starts out really slow and you get a kind of back story about the the whole green lantern thing and what theyre all about and how it was all created then it takes you to Earth where Ryan Reynolds character Hal Jordan is a hot headed pilot who gets into a lot of trouble in one xxx um turns out hes chosen to represent the green lanterns um from Earth so not to spoil anything but um he goes he trains and um turns out hes got to fight off this evil um thing called the Parallax which um feeds off a fear and the green lantern represents will power so its about little will power versus fear and its just coming to Earth and its gonna destroy everything so hes got to try to find the way to stop it essentially before it destroys everything because its just feeding off a fear then theres this theres also subplot villain um Hector Hammond who because exposed th by the fear and starts mutating and turning into a villain and I wont tell you what happens with that or what the ending result is or anything like that but overall um go see it it was a cool movie the acting was allright um I thought they casted kind of well but what really threw me off was the dialogue very cheezy dialogue oh my god the whole movie had a really dry dialogue there were a couple funny parts but I dont think the humour redeemed the movie from being so bad in the dialogue department whoever wrote this isnt the writer definatelly but overall I enjoyed it the the whole movie I was you know thinking this isn as bad as Ive heard and it wasnt um and the movie was pretty short as like an hour and a half and the dialogue threw me off other than that um I think it was and OK movie definatelly a little bit above average I dont think its as bad as you probably read on reviews so yeah go see it tell me what you think adios,0
27,G-xst2euQUc.wav,Hey guys I have a very short movie review for you Last night I went to see the movie Rio which is the animated movie um it is um produced by the same company um that produced the I Iceage movies um and in that respect it very similar starts up with the baby a lot of those movies produced by that company tend to start up with baby animals to tug at the heart strenghts although I think Iceage started up with the baby human yeah anywayit was a really cute movie I did not think I was gonna like it I really didnt wanna go see it um Ill tell you why they start up pushing that movie at least 6 months ago in the theaters and trailers and it seems to me than when production companies start pushing movies that far ahead and when they were gonna be released that usaually means that they are not gonna be great and I was pleasantly surprised by this movie I was I thoroughly enjoyed it um this is a great family movie to take your whole family to this movie its great for all ages um I thought the story line was really cute and again it does really tug at the heart strenghts with the little baby animals at the beginning um it has it has a very predictable story that so what is still a really great movie to take your whole family to um I thought that the actors who did the voices and Ill list all of those in the information box because I dont really remember who all of them were Anne Hathaway that sticks out of my mind and um Eisenberg um whats his first name I dont know but he did the voice of the main character Anne Hathaway did the voice of his love interest and I dont know if Anne Hathaway did the singing theres a little bit of singing in this movie but if it was Anne Hathaway who did the singing she did a great job I had no idea that Anne Hathaway could really sing If thats her singing anyway um I would recommend it if if youre like me and you dont normally go to see animated movies and Im Im not really in a big hurry at my age to go see animated movies um but there really hasnt been much to has come out this year so far that Im dying to go see and we really wanted to get out of the house um last night Yesterday was Easter so we went to the theater and that was showing um and so we did go to see it and I was thoroughly um surprised at how much I really did enjoy it So I would recommend this movie um anyway thanks for watchingyou guys have a great day bye,0
28,G6GlGvlkxAQ.wav,I wanna give you guys a quick spoiler free review of the movie summer blockbuster I would put money on it that it is going to be the blockbuster hit of the summer in terms of when you look at all the movies I Im a cap guy Captain america fan I think that would do very well but Thor just look at the numbers what it did last night it did three point um two five million just on midnight shows alone over on the opening night I just saw report from Friday the first two days were out um in the lot of theaters had when you look at the imax in 3D and 2D um so I think Thor is really gonna do well I think its gonna catapult Chris Hemsworth to be even a bigger star um I know he already did a remake of Red Dawn um great 80s movie for those who havent seen it originally with Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen by the way Charlie Sheen was winning there and hes winning no um and they actually moved Red dawn back to later this year so they could um um kind of get a little bit of Chris Hemsworth star power into that um great movie overall they did very well to establish the character of Thor the problem with a lot of comic book shows and movies and you saw this with the NBC recent flop of the Cape which is a show I love but the audience that was watching it they needed they needed a pay off right away and they needed character established right away um what you get in the sitcoms in terms of comic books and kind of the movies that take so loud to build that and why is this person wearing tights or why are they carrying a hammer you know why what is their mission or why why are they here you have to establsih that fairly quickly and I think that directors of Thor and the script writers did that right away you saw Thor for how hes in the comics pompous an arogant individual you saw what happens to him you saw how he ends up on Earth um but they also did a great job in building the backstory of Jane Foster played by Natalie Portman and her crew and how they relate to Thor so I think that was really good they didnt belabored Thor on Earth he sounded like he didnt learn from the earthlings um if if you are true Marvel comic fan you know that Thor in the comics thinks hes better because hes a god you know he always makes comments like oh gama radiation can hurt you it cant hurt us guardians were gods and hes right about that so he gets to he gets to Earth and see what happens there all while youre seeing whats going on with xxx and Loki and I think there was another great thing um this is not a spoiler but Marvel has already publicly announced that Loki will be the main bad guy in the adventures which makes sense because if you go back in adventures lower youll see that Loki was originally the reason why the adventures hat to be put together um so that makes sense um so they established Loki the established the relationshop between Thor Loki and Odin um they go back until some of Loki history that would only hard core comic fans know um huh Sif um and um Im forgetting the guy with the red beard I forget his name um um their group they establish they establish everything um they get the Earth you get other whole shield involvement which is cool to see that a lot of cooler references that at one point they reference Im a doctor with gama radiation um which are those moral fans ot all the trouble Petty Gross who was played by Liv Tyler in the Incredible Hulk movie a couple of years ago the refer,0
29,GWuJjcEuzt8.wav,OK so hi everyone this is my first movie review so I watched Burlesque the past week and well it was another movie considering you know thats theres not much xxx video in Singapore to lease so um first things first Christina Aguileras xxx I swear the xxx xxx um why I said that is because she is god a crazy crazy voice and she sure can sing really really well in this movie you know she sings tough love and you know the classic songs and you know it makes you wanna know who else you know in the history of nowadays has the voice like that and you know its noone xxxit you know that she gets to choose the song because shes the executive music producer in the movie so you know she should be next xxx voice anyway next would be Cher who has been away for like probably centuries I think but you know she my mom says shes probably like 60 70 years old but she still looks like shes 48 and her face doesnt move at all coz when you see her face moves it feels like you know you feel worried for her you feel like her face is going to fall apart and overall the movies quite entertaining that the dancers um wonderful its sexy but not slutty you know theres not much of nudity exept for you know for the male lead who is drop dead gorgeous by the way but Im the girl so thats not the point the point is um the songs in the movie are wonderful you know it matches the whole theme of the movie you know cabaret and you know the looks and overall probably Id give it about 35 stars you know popcorn movie and you know considering all the awesome movies that we had and xxx Inception the Black Swan and you know the Social Network this one you know probably in the middle so 35 stars and if you have money to spend go ahead,0
30,HEsqda8_d0Q.wav,So I went to the premiere of the Christmas Carol It was amazing the premiere itself was really cool but Im gonna tell you about that in another video because otherwise this video will be mega mega long This video is about the film itself and I actually liked the film a lot and I wasnt expecting to because I thought how the hell is Dickens and Disney gonna work together like this So kind of opposite but I thought they actually worked pretty well If you dont know the story that well its all about guy this old guy called Scrooge whos really mean and he never spends any money on anyone and I guess visited by these three ghosts the ghost of Christams past the ghost of Christmas present and the ghost of Christmas yet to come and they show him you know what his life has been like what it is like now what is going to be like if he keeps being like he is But yeah than he changes his ways and xxxin the end and the end part is really really funny because hes been such a grumpy character and hes really scared and in the end hes so changed and hes really funny hes like what a delightful child and its all kind of its hard to explain but if you see it than youll understand what I mean the animation was amazing I wasnt expecting that much because sometimes 3D isnt really that good but it was fenomenal you kind of forget about the fact that it is 3D the voices are really good that was one of my other concerns was that as an English person I get really annoyed when American shows and films have an English character but than its so obviously not an English character but yeah generally the accents were really really good so good one you America for doing that hah America the the land that made this film what else I doubt that theyre gonna do this for all the screenings because it was the premiere On each seat there was the um a bottle of water a bar of chocolate and a bag of humbugs I would not have chosen to go and see that but Im really really really glad I saw it and I would recommend it to other people its true even though I was like hu Im gonna hate it but Im just gonna have to say it Its my favorite film ever um its not my favorite film ever but I would definately watch it again I can imagine getting this on DVD and watching it at Christmas at time because it makes you feel so like huh its not about commercialization its about you know families being together Anyway next video is going to be the footage from the thing and Ill tell you all about like the cool premiere and stuff and Im sorry its over the mid way but I just wanted to put this up soon Hes xxxtakes of me trying to make this video early on which were um a disasterous so enjoy and yes see you next video throat cleaning um singing coughing whats wrong with me laughter amazing,0
31,I5y0__X72p0.wav,hey welcome to foxs den today i saw a uh movie called hannah and i saw a couple reviews before i went and i was pretty open to to it being good i at first when i saw the previews i thought it was gonna be stupid to be perfectly honest i thought hannah was gonna suck i was like theres no way that theyre gonna be able to convince me that a sixteen year old girl can take down like six adult dudes so i saw some other reviews and i was like okay i was surprised because these are some people that i trust i i beyond the trailer jeremy jenz these are the people that i get get my my stuff from my reviews so i watched those reviews and they both liked it they s and all the people walking out of the theatre and beyond the trailer really liked it so went and saw it today with some friends and i gotta say i wasnt blown away by it i didnt think it was great or epic or just fantastic it was good i mean i dont regret seeing it it was it was an it was an okay movie basically you have this little girl that uh um eric bana decides to train to be this most paranoid asassin chick in the world because i don i dont wanna give it away because if i say why then youre gonna know anyways skipping past that shes got this like kick A attitude shes gonna you know go in and wipe out this xxx so its it kind of feels like a sundance film festival type of movie its good but its not great its not polished quite as much as i would like it to be it is good though like they convinced me like this chick could probably take that dude down which is pretty hard because i went into the movie thinking theres no way and so they kind of explain it a little bit but not really um i i at the end of the movie the friends i was with uh one of them goes was there a plot to this movie it doesnt have a deep seeded plot theres not like a really good twist its a good action movie its like 90 bourne identity meets 10 willy wonka theres some really strange characters in this movie that i i dont know where they came from it was it did add to the movie though it and it visually its kinda cool how they show her confusion because she grows up in the woods you see that in the trailer shes in the woods like training and stuff so you see it through the video kind of how once she gets into society things are not normal for her they it it kind of spins out of control shes never see a lot of this stuff so it it was and interesting movie it was original and i liked it the soundtrack was interesting um it wasnt bad but it was it was interesting it wasnt the it wasnt the usual i did like kind of like the action the music kinda drove a lot of the action which is cool and so i would say i,0
32,Iu2PFX3z_1s.wav,the new film Hanna staring Eric Bana Cate Blanchett and it lead star as Hanna Saoirse Ronan who is Academy Award nominee for her film Atonement Now this film is directed by Joe Wright who had directed Atonement and Pride and Prejudice and the big flaw the Soloist This is his most engaging endevour yet Its Joe Wright the action director here and he what he does with Hanna is he makes the movie on like anything weve seen before He takes great actors or acresses in this case like Saoirse Ronan and Cate Blanchett and he puts them in very strange and unusual characters We se Cate Blanchett as an FBI agent with the texas straw and big fake teeth and um Saoirse Ronan as this k kind of Kill Billish action star child um what really need about this movie is the Chamical brothers did the soundtracks whats pulse pounding the entire way through you never know whats gonna happen Theres all these colorful characters Now it isnt a great fantastic tell everybody about that kind of movie I gave it a B but I think its one of those movies thats so unique that you respect that Joe Wright tried to do something completely different here Its colorful its in your face its really non stop from beginning to end and I think um what I took away from this was that really tried very hard to make something original and something that I cant find anything else to compare it to um Hanna is reted PG 13 It is in cinemas everywhere this weekend for my full review on Hanna check out texasartfilmcom Im Dustin Chase,0

35,LSi-o-IrDMs.wav,who to review of the Final destination which I did get a chance to see this weekend on Saturday but I didnt have time to review it I wasnt planning on reviewing it but its actually worth talking about because the movie itself is the same old crap from the series and I actually am not finding the series to be very fun and popcorn kind of movie You just cant walk in exopecting anything other than that um you know you got your kid who cen see in the future he sees that everyone all his friends are gonna die in a horrific accident he averts the accident and saves all his friends so you know karma kicks in and death says no Im gonna come get you and you know you cant escape me and um you know one by one they get picked off in the same order they wouldve died in the original accident and you know the main kid it um its its his job to save everyone essentially convince them that its true in this case it didnt take much convincing which is a little silly but the acting is bad the plot is you know actually the acting is OK I guess for this kind of movie the plot is is is threadbare the the um character development is nil but none of those things matter its a fun movie anyway its a popcorn movie and the main thing I wanna talk about is this dolby 3D um its not real D like the normal 3D thats been around recently the with the plastic black kind of buddy holly glasses this is a different kind of glasses and Ill show a picture right now I took it with my cell phone camera which is a terrible picture but hopefuly it will give you an idea what theyre like theyve actually got a little sensor on the side that wont let you leave the theater its like something youde see on article of clothing in the department store um but um this 3D definatelly looks a lot better I think that real D it corrects some of the issues that that had like I I found the real D the image was still sort of misaligned even with the glasses on um and um this this corrects that problem completetly at least where I was sitting I was sitting right in the middle of the theater I had ideal seats because its good to sit right in the middle of the theater with 3D and um at least in my experience it is um but the they looked awesome the 3D itself really had improved it looks like things are actually coming out at you um the color looked great coz sometimes 3D can mess up the color at least the old anaglyphic 3D I think real D it you know had sort of had sort of tempted but it winds itself its also um not ideal for for the imigae itslef um but this looked amazing looked really good and it makes it worth going to see this movie if youve got um the dolby 3D somewhere in your town weve got at the Studio movie grill theater chain in North Texas theyve theyve bought the system and theyve invested millions of dollars into these glasses um so they obviously expected to make a lot of money and I hope this takes over as the new system I would love that that be that would be cool to see I mean eventually were gonna get burned out as a soci as a society once agian were gonna be burned out on 3D because its it is a gimmick ultmatelly um but I will say um with this with this quality of 3D you could almost make you know a regular like a dramatic movie or an action movie or something that was really good movie and you could make it 3D and it wouldnt at all,0

39,OQvJTdtJ2H4.wav,hi this is my frist reviw in like ever um I just saw the Clash of the titans movie it couldve been better the first one was a lot better They couldve made Zeus a little less sparkly it was very distracting um it was very hard to follow the first one made more sense and the crackon you know in the preview is like so much hype they pretend theres gonna be this big scene it maybe lasts about a minute and I was like is that it and than its definatelly not a 3D movie the previews are much more 3D the ne so yeah it was very disappointing I give it about one and a half stars so thats thumbs down if you dont understand so it is not a buy but the CGI was great and thats exectly how I thought a giant scorpion would look with the piece of driftwood that had blue fire on it um Medusa was way different from Percy Jackson and Glandon Laws which BTW Im getting tomorrow because I got 100 dollars for doing an essay so yeah throat cleaning but the best part about the movie I ve got a free pair of glasses and you might be a like well they tell you to recycle hahaha haha so kind Im saving the environment coz they have to run this through pure alcohol then just xxx plastic but repackaging it so Im saving the environment I just reduced my carp and footprint by stealing this glasses,0
40,OtBXNcAL_lE.wav,so im gonna talk about the movie something borrowed featuring kate hudson uh jennifer goodwin that one dude from the office and a guy who looks a lot like tom cruise um lip smacking this movie is dumb uh i personally think its a waste of money just because i cant stand movies that are so predictable laughing i just just cant stand movies where its like the same plot as like 50 other million movies just different just different people playing the roles i really dont care to see those but you know what i took a chance you know i like kate hudson so i thought this movie would be funny and dont get me wrong there were you know funny parts in the movie i just dont care for the plot i dont care for basically any of it because its predictable so the plot is jennifer goodwin her name is rachel shes the only character in the movie that i knew the name of because i really am oblivious to life and dont pay attention to things so rachel is this underdog kind of girl her best friend kate hudson um steals her um college um law school crush um you know mr dreamy whatever not real anyways lip smacking so she steals him and uh couple years later theyre gonna get married what happens basically is that um she has sex with her best friends fiance which is her law school crush they just go at it in the back of a cab which is if i was the cab driver i would of just pull over and kick them out because i would never deal with people making out in the back of my cab um anyways that has nothing to do with the movie so you can pretty much already guess whats gonna happen uh you know during this movie its the same you know rise and fall the underdog you know she gets the guy but shes in trouble you know cuz she doesnt wanna tell her best friend blah blah blah and then uh she loses the guy because the guy doesnt wanna make a decision whether or not he wants uh rachel or her best friend and so shes all sad walking in the rain blah blah blah and then she gets the guy back and then her best friend sleeps with like this one dude named like marcus or something and uh shes pregnant with his baby and blah blah blah ive been saying that a lot in this video blah blah blah blah um yea so anyways its really predictable i mean you can go see i personally didnt like it because i just got really bored with it um and its really unpredictable i just get so tired of unpredictable movies like these guys in the,0
41,Oz06ZWiO20M.wav,hey everybody whats going on its time for new episode of Lance TV Im a little late to the game coz Im gonna do a Sucker punch review and I feel like everyone in the world has already seen and reviewed Sucker Punch its like the most reviewed movie of the year so far and lot of the reviews were a lot of fun Ion 9 did a did a big long piece about it that was pretty funny and um Stupid for movies had this really long like really not really long but like really intense rent a about it um and Ill Ill touch Ill touch on a lot of those issues that they raises well but I wanted to give my own two cents I saw last night I knew it was supposed to be really bad but curiosity got the best of me and I I see all those kind of cult movies like this um I just I didnt wanna be left out of the the converstation um it was playing right down the street at the Vista which is my favorite theater here in LA so you know I went to go see it um and it it is just like everybody saying it is bad I dont think its like the worst movie Ive even seen just this year I mean Ive seen a lot of movies this year coz I was doing this week in movies but I would say I I enjoyed Sucker punch like I was more entertained by it than Battle LA which was just a slog and boring and I just try to totally uninteresting and Sucker punch is a failer but like a really ambitious weird the interesting idiosyncratic failure um it is bad but its not bad I think the way most people have been saying its bad its not bad in the way I was expecting it to be bad um it really is not trying to be a dramatic film or an action film like I think most people thats their knock on it is that its not you know conventionally satisfying as like you know with drama that we dont get to know anything about these characters their play isnt interesting their path to freedom is not compelling and its basically telescoped within the first ten minutes of the movie where were sort of told whats gonna happen before it happens um and and all those things are true but I dont think its trying to be that I think its really much more like a musical and I know this is gonna sound silly coz its such a broad goofy mainstream cult kind of movie but it really has more in common with a musical or and opera or even a ballet than a regular narrative film coz like am remains in narrative film is about character development and plot and then spectacle like in third place so its like puts some people in it and youre gonna enjoy spending time with them therere some funny dialogue make them compelling in their relationships compelling and then have a story thats like at five minutes this happens and at ten minutes this happens that like moves forward and has momentum and then you know put in some action or some romance or sex or whatever like to keep people sort of engaged um and thats what traditionl narrative movies do and this movie is really much more like the plot is what little there is and the characters are they are all just place holders its really like like if you went to go see the ballet and its about the spectacles like the story of Swan lake is why people go see Swan lake its the movement and the dancing and the music and the sets and the experience,0

43,PZ-lDQFboO8.wav,hi everyone welcome to Toffers movie review so its Saturday June 7 and just like said last night I went out today to see Kung fu panda so heres what I thought I was a little bit disappointed in the film the movie does star Jack Black um courses his voice over for a panda who wants to learn kung fu and become a famous dragon master and basically save the world now thats his life long dream now his father who by the way is a duck Um has a dream for him of becoming the owner of the noodle shop um now of course there is an all star cast that has Angelina Jolie Jackie Chan Lucy Liu Seth Rogan all of course that have voice over parts but the movie itself was just a little dry it didnt have a whole out of humor going on with it at least none that really made you wanna laugh out loud um even the kids and the audience itself just kind of chuckled a little bit gave a few laughs now Im not gonna lie therere a few parts that have great action sequences now even though it is an animated film it did have some great fight scenes um but as far as humor goes not as much as I was expecting everything you see in the trailer itself was pretty much all the humor youre gonna see in the movie um um a you know along with the xxx I would probably saying go see this movie an early showing dont spend a lot of money for the night viewing um maybe better like next time Dreamworks but for this one for me it just wasnt what I was hoping it would be I love the Shrek films I liked Ants but as far as Kung fu panda goes I was hoping for a lot more It just wasnt there for me I dont know next weekend um we have the Happening coming out and the Incredible hawk so maybe next week Ill have some better reviews for you,0
44,QN9ZIUWUXsY.wav,hissing Im back sorry for the long wait I really have no justification for why Ive been gone for so long I mean I havent really seen that many movies since 127 hours but I just I dont know I couldnt master the will power to make a video Im really really sorry but I can promise you Im back for good now you know why because I saw five movies today and the one of them the first one is what Im going to review to xxx you guys right now it is Tron legacy this movie has been hyped up for months and months Disney has been marketing that crap out of this movie I I mean its just its literally been everywhere main draw for me for this movie was just the fact that its set in this like ridiculous world with all these bright beautiful colors and ridiculous action sequences Tron Legacy is this sequel to the 1982 classic Tron and I dont think thats a very good movie but I do think its a very interesting one its a first movie that used like legitimate special effects like um like they use computers like to generate part of the movie and that have not been done before ever and considering the first movie was a massive innovation theres obviously a lot of expectations of this one um you know Disney poured at least 300 million into this movie um a lot of expectations where writing on it so what do I think of Tron Legacy I can tell you that Tron Legacy is not a good movie but I was still ridicilously entertained by it are these two things possible in the same sentanceI I really do think so let me um th just let me explain tron Legacy is a movie where on most counts that I judge movies it kind of fails the performances are nah the script can be horrible its its a bit of a mixed bag coz there were some very bright moments um the direction is a bit its wobbly basically a lot of elements that I could take a movie on its really wobbly but what it lacks in those areas it most definately makes up for just like sheer visual spectacle I mean this movie has the most gorgeous visuals out of any movies since probably Avatar me if not prettier so many moments in this movie that are just framed and lit so perfectly that so that you just go like kind of huh thats really really cool and then take that world that have been set like a crap tunnel of really kinetic really well done action sequences in it and you have Tron Legacy I I cant belive I havent like explained the plot of this movie yet so its set literally inside the computer it it doesnt make much sense I know and basically um theres this kid named Sam flinth um um hes dad was a head of a big coorporation and then he disappeared twenty years ago and for whatever reason Sam um he gets a page telling him to go to an old araade that his dad owned and basically this makes no sense but he ends up in the computer um and there he basically has to fight his way out to survive but then he finds his dad in an also,0
45,Qr1Ca94K55A.wav,hi this is cheeseburger man from xxxby the review and this is my straightforward review of Drive Angry 3D now this movie is just ridiculous and I I thought it was excellent um stars Nicolas Cage as a man who escapes from hell because he wants to rescue his granddaughter coz she was kidnapped by satanic worshipers and they wanna sacrifize her so they can bring hell on earth now Nicolas Cage runs into Amber Heard character she was a waitress and she kind of becomes an unofficial sidekick of Nicolas Cage in this movie now she was really xxx in it I felt because they needed something hot to look at on the screen for an hour and forty minutes her acting was pretty bad she didnt really do anything for me but the real star that fell out of this movie was William Fichtner character or William Fichtner I should say his character was the accountant of hell and his job was to bring Nicolas Cage back to the other world now Nicolas Cage isnt really known for his acting lately coz hes had a lot of bad movies and his acting wasnt really good in that movie but it made it hysterical and it was just funny with all of these little one liners that he had and whatever so no Im not saying this movie is bad coz its its not its everything I expected it to be Like I said before it had tacky one liners that were just hysterical there was just plenty of blood um there was there was plenty of sex there was plenty drugs and rocknroll whatever you want it it was it was good um one of the big things I was disappointed though was I felt that they couldve done a lot more with 3D I thought I was expecting to see more body parts flying around after they were shot up by shotguns but I mean it just it just didnt happen um there were a lot of gun fights and some really cool gun fights but there were just people getting shad with blood and splatter and I thought it was just gonna be more than that but so I was a little disappointed in that um now I dont really recommend this if you go on a date with some girl um but if youre xxx movie goer like I am I totally recommend seeing this because its just a fun entertaining movie and I think that you will enjoye it,0
46,Sqr0AcuoNnk.wav,hi guys i just saw the movie friends with benefits and im going to review it for you i took some notes so im gonna read what i wrote down i guess before i get into specifics um ill just say like the basic um overall thoughts on the movie i dont really know i dont its so weird i there were times in the movie where i felt really bored and there were times that i thought it was funny and there were times that i was just sitting there after they said their jokes and i was like thats not nobodys laughing thats not funny i just dont think it was very good and this is the thing friends with benefits and no strings attached they are the same movie different ways of getting to the same point but its the same point so i think that no strings attached was better than friends with benefits i was not bored during no strings attached i thought it was very funny um and uh friends with benefits had its moments butsigh it had a lot of really bad moments i dont know im gonna im gonna go through the things that i wrote down and well see if i can give any more information on this richard jenkins is in this movie and he is one of my favorite actors ever he is brilliant there is not a movie that i see him in that i dont end up crying because he is so fantastic and he just breaks your heart whenever he does you know a role that usually his roles do break your heart at some point so definitely did in this movie i like teared up in friends with benefits because of him the lady who plays justin timberlakes sister um i thought she was very good in this movie and i thought she was just like really natural and funny and she looks like renee zellwegger and helen hunt from a twister movie and she talks like her too does anybody else like if youve seen it dont you think that she talks exactly like her it was weird the whole time i saw her all i thought was helen hunt and renee zellwegger another thing was the fact that there was not one healthy relationship or positive good relationship in this whole movie his sister and her son lived with his dad his his mom left his dad and him years ago and now his sister who isnt married and has a son who doesnt have a dad lives with the dad the son is ashamed of his dad then milas mom or whatever her name is jamies mom is an awful mother she doesnt even know who her dad is so its like and then they have a together they have an awful relationship so its like i dont know when i was watching it i was like people like their lives are awful like if you ever think about it maybe im looking too much into it but thats kind of depressing another thing that kind of is like to me if you do this thing that im gonna talk about right now it sort of is like you know that your movie is gonna,0
47,TvyZBvOMOTc.wav,Leap Year is a romantic comedy about a woman who flies to Ireland to propose to her boyfriend on Leap Day Which would have been a better name for the movie Unfortunately the plane lands on the other side of Ireland and she has to acquire an Irishman to get her to Dublin As they race against the clock many small problems arise to complicate their journey I rented the movie Leap Year a a few weeks ago with my friends and I really enjoyed it The countryside which they showed while going across Ireland was astoundingly ble beautiful And in the scene with the destroyed castle it really reminded me why I want to go there so badly Although I enjoyed the movie if I think about it honestly the plot wasnt that great Its a fun chick flick but other than that it doesnt really hold up under inspection lip smacking All the problems that come to stop them from getting to their destination are although plausible a little weak Even though the whole movie is based on whether she gets to Dublin in time youre never really worried about it because you know she gets there Lip Smakcing A lot of this movie brings a cute laugh here and there And both the actors Amy Adams and Matthew Goode work well with each other and seem to be really enjoying themselves the whole way through Even when theyre fighting in the movie though it just seems like its their banter not actual dislike All in all if youre looking for a cute romantic comedy with a beautiful setting then this will probably be a good movie for you,0
48,VCslbP0mgZI.wav,This is the one minute review of Suckerpunch Poop music in background laughing currently in theatres starring no one youve ever heard of directed by zach snyder who also directed watchmen 300 the legends of gahul guardians of owl land whatever that came out and i never saw it breathing in deeply so heres the thing with this movie i actually saw this movie a couple weeks back ive been kind of on a one minute review hiatus sorry and so i never really see other reviews before i do mine but i have seen some reviews of suckerpunch and this suckers getting this sucker is getting panned like last airbender garbage panned and i wanna say this i did not think it was like last airbender garbage um heres why yes stuttering t theres problems with this and i wanna talk about them but you know it looks beautiful there are some really cool uh moments in this it actually has some some them thematically it has some cool themes about heroism and about like taking ownership of yourself and things like that which i resonated with and i whi and which i appreciated but heres the essential problem with this movie the essentail problem of this movie well maybe this would be the best way to put it um there was a uh a comedian named dave chapelle um and dave chapelle um and another comedian chris rock are um african american and in their comedy they sometimes take on african american culture what they perceive to be african american culture and so they will essentially make fun of black people and the thing with dave chapelle and with chris rock is because theyre black they can kinda do that and theres something about that thats acceptable um if like me or laughing some other white person or hispanic person or whatever did the same jokes it would not be funny it would be completely inappropriate in fact it would be racist so zach snyder here is making a movie thats ostensibly about female empow empowerment but its a movie about female empowerment which includes a lot of clearing throat slapping that includes a lot of women in bustiers that includes a lot of violence done against women and ultimately in which most of the women end up completely disempowered clapping laughing so okay if zach snyder were a woman i would say okay shes making a comment about the way women cant be empowered in male dominated societies in the way men um distract and and hurt and damage women and prevent them from asserting who they really are i could kinda see that in a sort of chris rock dave chapelle way but zach snyder is a guy and because of that this stuff kinda ends up looking like the sh he man woman haters club so if i give zach snyder the benefit of the doubt this is a movie that looks great has some bad acting and has way too much violence against women if i dont give zach snyder the benefit of the doubt,0
49,VbQk4H8hgr0.wav,welcome to this weeks movie review on Shrek the third starring Mike Myers Cameron Diaz and Abraham Shrek is already the second film that comes out as a sequel its the third installment of the series and we had Spirderman already and we had a ton of them coming up this summer and this is the one that I can say was definatelly disappointed I love the first Shrek and the second Shrek and I was really hoping that this one be just as good and it just that it hadnt anything new to offer I was really disappointed with that I mean I went in there hoping to see something original and funny like the first two and it offered nothing of the such it wasnt remotly funny there was a few jokes OK yeah make you giggle or something but thats nothing major nothing really that funny or anything original the characters are all the same and not even as good as the first two movies last ye the last Shrek that came out the second one introduces Puss in boots and I loved Puss in boots and he wasnt even that great this time around the donkey and puss in boots rivalry thats going on it just it wasnt as funny the third time around and there was nothing new to offer plain and simply it was dull for me it couldve been so much better I I couldve I saw it being so much better in my head but it just wasnt it disappointed me highly and I was just sort of discouraged after seeing the movie and Im definatelly wish I had my money back um it was a waste of my time and I dont suggest anyone go see it if youre hoping to if you have to have if you have kids and youre forced to go which you probably will if you have kids you know put up with it as a parent but on your own dont go see it its not really that great everyone is split on this one just as they were on Spiderman and just they are with all the other sequels that are coming out an this one I have to agree on the negative side it was not great it wasnt even remotely good I mean theres a few moments yeah that are original and funny and theres a ne an introduction of a new character Justine Timberlakes character already in the film but they didnt even give him that much to do the he had only few minor lines and none of them were really that great I mean stands out in your mind so the addition of this character was pretty pointless I mean its pleasent to the story but I still find it pointless in the end of the movie and the characters just werent the same as the first two that I fell in love with them it just kind of made me wanna really walk out of the theater to add to the problems I had a problem with the audio in my theater so that just pissed me off more but really I couldve shouldve just walked up and left at that moment it was boring and not at all original in my opinion it couldve been so much better than the second sequel was really great and I loved it and this one just was a flat of disappointments so Im gonna rate this one two stars it shouldve really be one but Im gonna give it a two to be fair because the movie did have some points when I was laughing but very few and it wasnt worth it in my opinion to go see it so I definatelly suggest,0
50,Vj1wYRQjB-o.wav,hello again Frank one two castle I know its been a quite long time since Ive done one of these but um I was very busy and you all probably saw movies over Christmas that you wanted to see anyway so Im back Anyway I went to go see Green Hornet which of course stars Seth Rogan who also helped write the movie um it was directed by Michel Gondry it stars other actors such as Jay Chou Christopher Christoph Waltz and Cameron Diaz um the Green hornet is a it was just like a radio a radio show like a let alone ranger and the green hornet was essentially like batman he was um a normal guy who used um gadgets and his side kick to stop to felt fight crime usually the natzis but thats not what this movies about um huh the way the green hornet was done via Seth Rogans point of view it was parody um the green hornet which is um his real name is Britt Reid he dosnt know how to do much um when he fights his xxx he has now science behind it in fact most of the work is done by Kato Kato fights for the green hornet um he makes the black beauty which is the car that green hornet uses he makes gadgets for the green hornet and he dosent get that much recognition but he helps out because he wants to fight for good um the movie starts off as as any superhero movie would you have character you have the main character who has a crisis happen in his life and he becomes a hero thats what this movie is um I thought the character is well done I loved how Seth Rogan played the green hornet I loved how Jay Chou played Kato they did a very good job Christoph Waltz he plays the bad guy he was the bad guy in Inglorious bastards um he just keeps doing that you know the bad guy where hes he seems calm but deep down hes an insane psychopath well he plays that well so hes a good villain he also has some really cool guns so that its like a desert eagle but it has to barrels to it its pretty pretty scary looking I wouldnt want that pointed at me um then Cameron Diaz plays the love interest um shes a very very very bright um bright journalist and um Britt Reid hires her on her good looks but he finds out theres actually a lot more of her than he initially thought and hes always trying to like um try to scare to fall in love with him but of course shes she doesnt wanna anything to do with him and I who would I mean Seth Rogan but anyw anyway I digress um like I said I thought the movie was great the action they do have is really well done um they did a good job with car they did a good job with the fight scenes they did like xxx almost fight scenes where they slow down they go through everything um,0

53,X3j2zQgwYgE.wav,Lets talk Shrek Ever After Um lip smacking Not great The gist of the story is that Shrek is tired of his life now married with the kids so he really would like to relive his glory days He goes to Rumplestiltskin and signs a contract that in order to have a free day where he can relive his glory stuff he will give a day Unbeknownst to Shrek Rumplestiltskin takes the day that he was born so then Shrek doesnt exist And in order to get things back to how they were he has to um get Fiona to fall in love with him and they have to once again have true loves first kiss Sigh I really think what this was missing was that humor and that wit that than the other Shrek movies Um its just not there Its okay But its really not wonderful Nothing to rush out and see There arent a lot of kids movies out right now so and I guess normally Shrek is for adults but lack you know very lackluster Anyway Thats it Chuckle be forewarned Low expectations Okay And now its late so off to bed Ciao,0

56,_dI--eQ6qVU.wav,Hello hello I like coming too here and I wanna give you guys a review of the Green Hornet movie I was lucky enough to snag passes to the advanced screening of the Green Hornet here in New York City The movies isnt actually released till January but I got a sneak peek Just like the Spiderman play that Ive recently reviewed it is not in its final form the people that worked on the movie were there at the screening and they said they might still tweet a couple of things before the movie comes out But I can safely assure you that even if they didnt it would still be a hit I knew nothing about the Green Hornet going into this even though Im a comic fan I havent had the time to pick up the Green Hornet Or listen to the radio program or anything like that so I came with the fresh view I had no idea about anything and I loved it I dont know if fans of the comic would be as inclined to say the same because I dont know how much it differs from the comic or radio program that people like so much but just going into this a as an observer and someone who has no idea it was a fantastic film it was so much fun and I would tell you right now it was hilarious It was really really funny Seth Rogen plays the Green Hornet and most of you know hes a pretty funny guy and he funnied up this movie big time totally He had a hand in writing the skript I think I saw on the credits so that doesnt surprise me and the humor it was kind of necessary I feel like if they woudlnt have inserted the humor into this movie it wouldve been just too serious and kind of boring in a sense but the humor really just nailed it and the action sequences in this movie are tensed I love when people do this when they just come up with these totally completely new stylized ways of developing action sequences coz sure its fun to see a super hero go round and kick bad guy butt you know punch kick whatever bam but when they figure out a new way to interpret this and add something like an extra spark in there that makes it more visually truly appealing and just different it engages the audience more and I just really enjoyed it Just like Scott Pilgrim employed that kind of sound effect in text and that kind of video game mask quality The Green Hornet did something similar but they took a new spin on it and I just loved it And I feel like even though the fighting sequences were a little bit long in some places t we did see it in 2D and the movie is gonna be released in 3D so I meant if I was wearing 3D glasses and was seeing this in 3D I wouldve enjoyed it a lot more and I would want the sequences to be even longer rather than shorter So the premise of this movie that there is this guy who has a very rich father whose father dies he inherits his money he decides to become a villain of the night sort of speak and fight crime and clean up his city with a sidekick,0
57,aiEXnCPZubE.wav,hey obviously this is my review of Sucker Punch Sucker Punch is the new Zack Snyder action film starring Emily Browning Abbie Cornish Jena Malone Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung the film follows Baby doll whos been locked away in a mental hospital in Vermont with the team of young misfits baby doll unlocks her mind to try and escape the hospital before shes lobotamized browning is institutionalized in this hospital after a mishap of her accidentally killing her sister this mental hospital isnt even a mental hospital it is a horror house browning is told by her instructor doctor Gorski to you know let go and dance for these men who can also be considered the pimps in this situation in doing so she acesses this fantasy world inside of her mind which ends up being this huge court of moral come back kind of thing where she ends up just kicking everybodys ass they are led by the wise man who is Scott Glenn and of course the antagonist to I believe in this case is Blue whos played by Oscar Isaak realizes of course that they are up to something mischiveous baby doll ends up convincing Sweet pea Rocket you know Blondie and Amber who are you know these all who are these misfits um to go into this little dream world with her um and you know like steal these items that will um eventually lead to their escape Sucker punch stars Emily Browning as Baby doll the innocent looking protagonist Browning is mediocre role theres never a feeling of star quality with her she isnt terrible but quite frankly she is implausible Browning has starred in you know those other films like the average horror film the Uninvited and visually stunning and I dont know why people are hating on the film because I really do love it xxx is a series of unfortunate events overall Browning is just fails to deliver and is upstaged by many other performances in the film the supporting cast is either hit or miss the hits include Oscar Isaak as the main villain like I said Blue Jena Malone is the soft spoken Rocket and the stealing Abby Cornish is Sweet pea a troubled and reluctant young woman in the pack the misses include you know Vanessa Hudgens who doesnt have any presents or greatness at all and the other horrible I mean absolutely atrocious Carla Gugino as doctor Vera Gorski whos accent is so aweful and whos is ridiculous and her character is also undeveloped and weak Jon Hamm and Scott Glenn could bring you know they could be interesting characters and they could have great back stories but they you know they they bring nothing to this table and which hurts the film drastically because they are interesting characters and could have interesting back stories the acting could be better and is very medio there is some sort of greatness to Sucker punch though first the visual effects here are stellar they are unique incredible icandy and just overall superb and the action in the movie is so well used but when the action is used in Sucker Punch its ultimately the gr,0
58,atnd_PF-Lbs.wav,hello everyone xxx for another review and before I start look at this haircut I got yes very new I got it today I hope you like it I do Very well the review today is for the movie where people were dying in 3D for your personal enjoyment and the series that died violently two years ago oh I mean the Final Destination or you can call it the Final Destination 3D dont forget that the people now the Final Destination is the forth film in entire series and the plan here is by the basics folks group of people go to Ness corvette one of them has a vision where a disaster happens and all of them were gonna die he she forces them to leave the event where the disaster than takes placeThe survivors than die one by one in a freek accident with the viewer supposed to believe that death is following them its bad oh God this is bad now this is not gonna be a rat so if you think this is gonna be a huge rat review no its not even worth it Im not even gonna go to the lows to make a whole night video about this movie so no now know this I am not a fan of the Final Destination series I hate it I might have to watch the first two again or maybe just the first one to stabilize my thoughts on the series but as far as Im concerned this series is garbage You can sense my excitement when I heard this was being released Now I wont even talk about acting coz its just so bad Its a joke really Now let just get into two things that will possibly attract you to this film the violence and the 3D viewers please resist from these two the violence here is pretty bad Therere about two creative scenes in here um one being in intestinal journey through the rectum in a swimming pool drain and a tire decapitation that the tire decapitation might not sound all that unique but the way its pulled off its like wow that was sick I mean not the sick like oh my God that was awesome no sick in the oh my god that was crazy that kind of sick theres many different ways of saying sick nowadays but um yeah wow agh say that in two shee two scenes death isnt even nearly unique is a bit harsh the race stadium scene and the mall scenes in the beginning and the end where massive amounts of people die in the craziest ways are pretty good for late night buddy viewing you see you know what I mean by late night buddy viewings If you dont than come on peop,0
59,bOL9jKpeJRs.wav,Hey guys its Bree and today Im gonna talk to you about The Expendables So last night I decided to watch the Expendables at midnight and I was unbelievably shocked how much I loved it It was full of action great dialogue the characters were so great and well developed Its really just a heart warming story Its a great movie to see over and over again your whole family can see it Its not that violent xxx it is a teenytiny bit violent and not enough so you can bring your 5 year old I really realy felt for the dad in the Expendables because he was protecting over his family and after they went missing even though theyre a bend of outsiders and thay have all those powers the dad was just really protective and he made sure that hes whole family was safe Very heart warming very touching Brad Bird is a great writer and director He wrote and directed Ratatouille and the Iron Giant um I think that my favorite part of the entire movie was when you find out at the end that the little baby had powers It was so cute just the great great movie I really recommend you all see the Expendables My boyfriend got really excited when I told him we were gonna go see the Expandables and than um when I went to blockbuster and I picked it up and I brought it back home he got really disappointed I think its because it was such a moving film and I dont think he knows how to handle his emotions in that department so it was just a little awkward but um weve overcome that You know a lot of people have been talking about the Expendables even though it came out such a long time agao theres been a lot of buzz about it lately and everyones you know a lot of controversy over it Everyones been saying its really intense I can see that There are parts that are very intense but for the most part it is a family friendly warm and fuzzy movievoovie So go see the Expendables I know you guys are gonna love it Stay tuned guys I have many more movies to go in through,0
60,bvLlb-M3UXU.wav,Silvester Stalone produced by Silvester Stalone starring Silvester Stalone directed by Silvester Stalone so yeah Silvester Stalone so its gonna be an action movie obviously and you you guys all know what the Expendables are and if you dont basically slice of the memo to all the action stars for the last twenty years and say hay show up for this movie so most of them dead and its really what you wouldve expact its not a compelling narrative by any means theres little to no character development all movie and yet this movie is incredibly enjoyable for action fans um start off kind of like who the charcters are um Silvester Stalone obviously is the lead character and he leads this troop of mercenaries called the Expendables and really theres no humongous tale to these guys just a bunch of army mercs who now make a living taking jobs um this movie just falls among other jobs just like you know the kind of the biggest hadrest job he had yet and essentially they are to take down a tyrant owned in another nation and thats really itjust take down this tyrant not a complicated story but you know what you dont need a complecated formula for an action movie theres a bad guy guy go take him down thats really all you need this movie essentially was made for three reasons in my opinion the first reason is the obvious just to make an exciting enjoyable action film and thats you know all thats all you really needed to do and definatelly comes through on that Ill touch on why in a bit the second reason this movie was made and in my opinion the real reason it was made again its Silvestre Stalone telling himself I still got it um Ive got to give him credit Hes in terrific shape for a man twice my age who looks significantly better than me thats kind of made me feel depressed but hey whatever and is showing yeah maybe hes not what he was twenty twenty five years ago but he still has every right to be billed as an action star theres actually yeah yeah scenes triple stand off with Silvestre Arnold Swarzeneger Bruce Willis and yeah actually in a way kind of fell hollow because you know its basically it was Stalone knowing these guys arent in the shape they were twenty twenty five years ago so hes like hey look I still got it yeah and I dont know if this scene took place fefteen twenty years ago when those guys were absolutely prime it wouldve been just um absolutely breath taking monumental moment in cinematic history but seeing it today now when it was really nothing more than just a one xxx ship it lost a lot of feeling it wasnt the final you know finally happened u uniting that we all come to expect it just it felt kind of cut and dry which would start the planning that I wish it has happened earlier in their careers the third and in my opinion most important reason this movie happened is in a way it felt like it was passing on the tou,0
61,c5xsKMxpXnc.wav,Im here to review Adjustment Bureau and I thought this movie was gonna be really good because matt damon was in it and I was really disappointed so this movies about david norris played by matt damon and what happens is that he is going to run for new york senator and he just cant win because he keeps on making mistakes a lot of mistakes involve stuff that just makes him look bad in the public eye pictures and stuff that he did where the people were like we cant have this guy cause hes not mature enough so now hes preparing his losing speech and he sees a girl in the bathroom and they instantly kiss I dont know they have like they talk for like five minutes and instantly kiss which is dumb but uh she runs away because these cops are chasing her because she crashed a wedding so the next day the adjustment bureau comes in these people that are supposed to change things so that people can have their own fate and the world will be alright now what happens is that matt damon is supposed to spill coffee on himself at exactly 705 but the Adjustment Bureau guy falls asleep and chuckling yeah he forgets to make him spill coffee on himself so he catches the bus and guess who he sees emily blunt so the adjustment bureau is pissed off because the guy that was supposed to make him spill the coffee and make him miss the bus messed up and now he actually knows her and gets her number and everything and theyre not supposed to meet theyre not supposed to fall in love its not part of the plan so matt damon goes to work you know sees his office and everything and sees everybody doesnt even realize that theyre not moving but yea when he opens the door to his boss office he sees that these people are like adjusting his life and hes wondering what the hell is going on and you know they tell him they adjust peoples lives and that they might have to erase his mind completely unless he stays away from the girl and doesnt tell anybody about the plan so matt damon of course does not listen and he still wants to be with the girl so he goes against the adjustment bureau but they keep on changing things on him so it makes it hard for him to be with her so pretty the whole story is about fate des versus free will and which one is more important what i liked about this movie was the concept was cool theres this people t you cant do anything because they are controlling your life pretty much like who you love and all this but they did not execute it very well and they left a lot of plot holes this movie is terrible for these reasons and im gonna tell you why number one because the love is forced you dont feel that these two people love each other and it is very rushed i mean you dont see why these two people love each other theres no character development really with these two like they have their own separate character development but none where these two should be together theres no reason why they should be together you dont see why they should like each other cause they dont show it in the movie i mean the the way they show it is like they ta,0

70,f9O3YtZ2VfI.wav,good evening friends this video was originally supposed to be Alfred Hitchcok Psycho versus the Curious case of Benjamin Button but I decided to do away of that crap so its just gonna be a review of Benjamin Button and the Curious Case of Benjamin Button what whatever the name is too long the curious case of Benjamin Button is a David Finchers film starring Brad Pitt as a man who was born old and grows progresivly younger as he grows older its a very interesting idea and its they looked like it had a good core but hm it just too many problems with it the first problem is that its all told in flashback from a point just before Katrina hits New Orleans I didnt need any of that crap I dont need it all told in flashback I dont need the added element of Katrina it dosent it just its too much crap in here the the movies is too long they just need to cut that out another thing is we dont need his entire life th we do not need the entire span birth to death just give me a nice interesting choke and scale it down on like two hours this also falls in to the trandy is very popular these days if you do a whole all of CGI um and if youre gonna do mostly CGI just make an animated movie this looks like it just has a polyurethane coating on it makes him look too too good but dont get me wrong its not all bad its got my two favorite acresses in it Tilda Swinton and Cate Blanchett like I said before Is a very interesting idea and they did a lot of good things with it but its its like someone made you a kick ass sandwich but they put mayonnaise on it and you dont like mayonnaise and its not like tomato or lettuce where you can pick it off no its got it mayonnaise in its all over everything and now youre stuck with this kick ass sandwich that would be kick ass if it didnt have mayonnaise on it but it has mayonnaise on it or you go make another sandwich go make another sandwich this movie is just not quite good enough I really liked David Finch I liked all the um I like the cast but and its a good story but clap huh its a pass my neighbor probably thinks Im crazy yelling about movies to a camera,0
71,f_pcplsH_V0.wav,I just want you all to know that just do we dont have to delay this review until Saturday i drove an hour each way to catch a midnight showing of this movie so you better appreciate this review i know the majority of the people who watch my reviews arent actually my subscribers but to any of you who are i expect a thumbs up got it but anyway lets start with the obvious who the killer was or killers theyre back to you having two killers thankfully because it does make a lot more sense having the killer be able to be everywhere if theres two of them okay first off here were the two guys in the trailer who were laying out the rules the assistant killer basically was the one with the long hair not the one with the camera hes killed and the main killer was Sidneys cousin Jill who was tired of living in Sidneys shadow and has decided to stage a remake of the original movie in which she can take Sidneys place at the end and so her basic goal is reenact the original movie only upping the ante on every single scene exactly as modern remakes do hmph my overall opinion of the results of this process are its better than Scream 3 and actually is better than Scream 2 a lot of people dont like scream 2 i think its highly underrated i hated Scream 3 but i think this one did beat Scream 2 Now i didnt really like the first hour that much though im sure you all remember the stab movies that were based on the scream movies or the experiences of Sidney in universe so that people could comment on the killers reenacting the movies or following up the movies well in the first hour those become way way way too much of a plot point basically theres now seven of them the fifth one apparently features time travel i think xxx i want to see it but anyway but it actually basically makes the characters congition not just of the genre within which they are in but of their own franchise to a ridiculous extent Im just kinda like no this is going to far there are only 3 scream movies,0
72,fvVhgmXxadc.wav,Hi Im Michael and Im Michael the movie man Today were reviewing Sucker punch this is the new film by Zack Snyder the director of Three hundred and the Watchman and this is Snyders first film thats not based on preexisting work Now getting to set up of Sucker punch which Ill get to in a minute it only had the potential to be a film that was both provking and action packed but unfortunately its just an ugly wild violent unvolving and sadistic exercise that I got very little joy out of in fact I got mostly pain out of it the story invoves young girl played by Emily Browning and after her mother dies she and her sister are sent to live with their evil stepfather after going through tons of abuse thats pretty heavily inferred in the opening sequence the young girl besides to try to escape but she ends up killing her sister by accident and than shes insitutionalized with her stepfather and is set up to have a lobotomy thankfully shes shes saved from the lobotomty by the head nurse and shes sent to work at the night club thats run by this other sadistic man named Boyo and where the girl who gets the nickmname babydoll when she gets there is forced to not only be trapped in the vocation that she obviously doesnt wanna be in but she also has to dance and satisfy some horny man that come in now it also takes so really creepy xxxof the fact that Emily Browning in this movie looks like shes underage even though I know for su for a fact that shes not underage in real life and movie itself says shes twenty but I dont know Ill get to that in a little bit anyway Babydolls than forced to dance for the first time by by the order of the dance instructor there the dance coordinator whos played by Carla Gugino and when she dances she goes into this alternate world that kind of looks like video game in a certain way in fact the first time she goes in it looks like a Japanese temple and later time she goes like a World War II battlefield um castle this kind of pulled out of Lord of the Rings anyway the first time she goes in she meets this prophet whos played by Scott Glenn and he tells her that she can escape from the world shes in by collecting a group of items and than one other itam that is shell gonna have to find out for herself what that is throat cleaning anyway so she gets the idea that hey we can escape and she tries to get the other girls who are dancing at the night club to and also trapped there to join in and shes able to and basically the rest of the movie is them going into or going back into babydolls dream worlds to try and collect all these items even though they are actually collecting the items within the real world and actually theres a lot of things going on as far as whats in Babydolls mind whats in her mind within her mind in a way its kind of like inception in that way its kind of playing with the idea whats real whats not what the Matrix films did although actually the best comparison this is this film would actually be something like Pans Labyrinth,0
73,iiK8YX8oH1E.wav,so Kate Hudson has a new movie its called Something borrowed Its one of those romantic comedies that we all dread Now the real star of Something borrowed is Ginnifer Goodwin who you might remember from Walk the line also in this movie is John Krasinski and newcomer Colin Egglesfield I think its how you pronounce his name now Kate Hudson plays herself in this movie Annoyingly she kind of yells and screams through the whole movie and if you can tolerate her the rest of the movie isnt any batter um it kind of follows the path of My best friends wedding 1997 Julia Roberts movie except it takes thirty minutes longer to deviate from the scripts of My best friends wedding there are some funny moments but mostly its just Kate Hudson being very annoying and I think its predictable up an to a point I think with with these kind of movies we kind of predict and we second guess ourselves so I will give it points for not being exactly like My best friends wedding even at the trailer sets it up that way Ginnifer Goodwin is fun to watch but I dont think shes leading material and like I said Kate Hudson couldnt be more annoying here If there is any silverlining in this movie its John Krasinski who I dont usually like but he has some of the funniest scenes in this movie He seems to be the only realistic character here Something borrowed opens in May its gonna be playing nationwide its rated PG 13 for texas art and film Im Dustin Chase and for the full review of Something Borrowed check out texasartfilmcom,0
74,jUzDDGyPkXU.wav,so i mean the title says it all for this movie battle for los angeles aliens invade they attack all the world and theyre coming but you dont know why and theyre just attacking from every point on the earth and its just a worldwide invasion and theyre about to takeover los angeles so and theres a plot with uh theres erin eckhart and his crew who are in la trying to stop the aliens alright so whats good about this movie the action is fucking awesome the action is really really well directed its very reminscent of district 9 its like someone watched the third act of district 9 a bunch of times like lets make this into an entire movie itll be awesome and thats pretty much what they did here but it didnt turn out quite nearly as awesome as that movie did in fact this movie isnt even on the same level as district 9 nor is it um for uh black hawk down which people are comparing it to i didnt really see a comparison to black hawk down until like the very very end but nevertheless another really cool thing about this movie the aliens are really awesome they designed the aliens in a really cool unique way to make them like biotic but also mechanical and they have really cool technology thats really interesting to watch like make them blow up shit and you know and they always like pull out something new but its not always quite explained you know like everything about the aliens but they give you a good amount of information about them like enough that it actually is a good reason why they why theyre attacking and it keeps your interests in the action scenes at least during this movie so and now we get to whats bad about this movie uh the dialogue is terrible there is no good dialogue nothing in this movie is cleverly written everything they say just sounds so fucking stupid the only actor who can really sell their lines is erin eckart there are moments where he says something youre like that just sounded dumb as hell but he totally sells it just to put this in perspective the last line of the movie goes like this erin eckhart gets asked something he turns hes like weve already had breakfast thats his last line like i mean im an actor but i kinda would have read that been like hm i mean schwarzanegger never said anything really that badass in his movies but arite and moving on theres no character development in this movie none the characters they tried to show a little something for them and people were telling me that this isnt that kind of a movie where theyre developing characters well i can tell you right now i dont remember the names of any characters none of them were memborable and they were all just really bland and forgettable and one o another big problem with this movie its two hours long okay at around right before the third act and it really gets action packed theres like,0
75,k5Y_838nuGo.wav,I havent posted a video because Ive been busy with school I have like four weeks left and it has been crazy trying to get final projects done and situated but um and mid terms so anyway Im back to do a review for you guys I have not seen Robin Hood yet so Im not reviewing that and I was gonna see McGruber this weekend and I still might so there might be review some time later from McGruber review but Im here to review Shrek forever after which I was not excited to see and it actually surprised me um to summarize it Shrek forever after is not Shrek hes in life and basically his life is repetitive same thing every day and than he realizes he just has a freak out momemnt he realizes that this isnt he wants to be a regular ogre again blah blah blah kind of goes on he meets Rumpelstiltskin and he signs a contract for being one day as an ogre and he has to give up one day in his past you know like one day of his life he couldnt remember well Rumpelstiltskin is tricky and what happens is that Shrek is transported to xxx ogre but then he cho Rumpelstiltskin chose the day Shrek was born so that Shrek never said Fiona he could be entrapped in castle of Rumpelstiltskin basically thats it and I have to admit I I like Shrek I do I like the first two Shreks quite a bit um theyve become quite a bit overrated but the first two were pretty excellent the third one was a piece of crap and thats why I was not excited about the fourth one um which actually was really good I did like the fourth one quite a bit um I I did enjoy it it reminded me of the first one had the same kind of vibe like the first one and it just was better maybe its the baby ogres maybe bringing in the baby ogres really brought it down coz the first two were great and they brought in the kids and it made it more kiddy friendly movie the first two were kid movies but they were had adult humour I though that adults would appreciate and would go over the kids heads and this is what the fourth one kind of has the third one was more kid humour though it didnt have that much adult humour in it um yeah the fourth one it does have kid humour definatelly its a kids movie but it does have some adult humour those are quote in this movie that sounded so dirty coming out but it as great did anyone notice yes um something about waffle hole am I the only one am I perverted not to think that that sounds dirty coz it totally does waffle hole it had me laughing out loud and I dont think that many other people were laughing about it but I was um creepy seventeen year old in the audience with her cousins who are five and four and yeah hah thats what happened um yeah its its better than the third one absolutely I didnt see it in 3D because my one of my cousins doesnt like the glasses,0

78,nzpVDcQ0ywM.wav,this movie is directed by steven summers whose claim to fame is the mummy franchise and he really seems to be channeling michael bay in this movie the plot has the consistency of swiss cheese and its really glossed over with lots of stunning special effects and big explosions sigh all in all its kind of a disappointment to any of us who grew up in the 80s and are used to the toys in the cartoon i feel like it almost should have had a g rating it was really kind of dumb down for us and i hate to say that i think you will really LOVE this movie if you are 8 but if you are a child who grew up in that time period youre not going to enjoy this movie very much because they arent playing to you theyre playing to a new audience of kids who dont know anything about these characters in the first place the plot involves some tiny little machines sometime in the future that can destroy cancer cells and have become weaponized and bad people are trying to steal the warheads and so a government secret group called gi Joe is trying to protect them from the bad guys channing tatum is the lead he starrs as duke hes from the step up movies i guess which i havent seen and all i can is hes a pretty average guy i dont really feel any emotional pull from him in this movie even a scene where he proposes to his girlfriend in a flashback he barely bats an eye his best friend is played by marlon mayans he plays rip cord marlon wayans kind of plays a watered down version of himself from other movies he does some stereotypical things like talking uh about busting a cap while flying an airplane but otherwise hes just there to be the best friend and hes pretty average too the two women in this movie are particularly good looking and they kick a lot of butt uh sienna miller and rachel nickols one on each side there and they kick each others butt they kick other peoples butt and so thats pretty entertaining this is a really big movie for their careers because i havent really seen them in a lot of big movies other notable mentions dennis quaid plays hawk leader of the gi joes and his performance is campy and comes off as an army cheerleader some of the time laughing jonathan price is the president he is average brendan frasier shows up in a cameo for a training montage and its sh so short lived he barely needs to even be there uh stormshadow is very cool his fight sequences are very neat and he delivers a lot of intensity snake eyes you never see his face but it turns out he is played by the guy who played toad in the first xmen movie and he also kicks a lot of butt he never gives up the villain,0
79,ob23OKe5a9Q.wav,hi my name is lily and today im gonna be giving a movie review over the smurfs i saw it um a few nights ago and i decided hm im gonna come and review it but it was a good movie id give it three stars only because it was very predictable very predictable not gonna give any like spoilers but very predictable um i saw it last night with my aunt and her boyfriend im not supposed to tell anyone that she brought her boyfriend cuz no one ever erase the last thing i just said that would be great that um i guess the only other problem i had with it was that um the jokes were really cheesy i dont like cheesy jokes but cheesy jokes are most times funny cuz theyre really bad so if thats the case then you should see this movie if you really like cheesy jokes predictable movies but other than that it was a perfect family movie i would definitely take 8 or younger kids to that movie its a definite family movie beyond this age the problem i had with the movie theatre is there were kids crying the whole time and whispering xxx does baby crying get on your nerves ever if it does wouldnt recommend going to this movie cuz theres a bunch of kids or sneak into a really late showing cuz i dont think kids are going to be out that late but thats the only problem i had with it other than that it was a good movie it was cute you know the actors did a great job bringing the smurfs to life such as joe george lopez neil patrick harris katy perry and a fourth it was a great movie and i loved it but i had a few problems so i didnt love it i liked it three stars for smurfs and stay smurfy everyone,0
80,pLTX3ipuDJI.wav,what can I say about the Predators movie I guess thats exactly you would expect from the movie in this genre a group of people the bad guys discover as to what the bad guys are and in the big long thing is who lives and who dies nothing new is brought in those Predator series no surprises no big twist no finish I like to tease some mystery and great plot what couldve been but than all is explained and disppeares ten minutes later its just a clear remake of Predator from back in 1997 with the premise being almost identical althought what wasnt the same was the connection to each other which first movie had and this one not in the first run they were a team and they worked together and you see the personalites this movie just pops a group of different killers down together and lets them interact poorly you dont see any of the personalities when one dies you dont mourn over tham an you dont get an attachment to anybody of the acting nothing stands out a spectacular which is to be expected of the movie like this but nothing sucks either which gains the movie some points I guess the film is xxx cast though with the Im trying to be bad ass Brody as a selfelected leader a doctor played by Topher Grace and a short camio in the way of Laurence Fishburne what disappointed me was that one of the most hyped actors in the movie was only in there for short amount of time and I know you cant hype a movie with an unknown actors so even if someone is in there for a few minutes you should hype them but its just a little weak overall for me than we were looking forward to him and he was gone quickly although what it did do was interesting but i but it didnt make sense he co Laurence Fishburne comes in and tells the characters things that only screen writers shouldve known about which gives a little more of f fony feel this whole thing just like one of the girls tells the exact story of the first movie its a pointless scene for the audience and the characters it dosent give an give any insight or help its just make them seem like she sa she saw the first movie in finale I would only recommend this movie for a rental non in theater because its a low grade sequal to the 87th version and only if you like the series,0

82,rnaNMUZpvvg.wav,the verdict is stupid and a complete waste of money not mine I mean sort of mine but it was a fun experience going like I didnt expect it to be good but its just such a waste of money for them like when I see the movie thats obviously had a very big budget and it is like not even good it makes me angry coz Im just like why are you wasting so much money aaaaa it wasnt even holding my attention I could barely stay awake through the movie I honestly wanted the aliens to win and Im gonna talk spoilers now all the characters were just so unlikable just there was only one character the doctor he was the only person I even really cared about and even he was a douchebag all of them every single cowboy was just a complete douchebag and there was just this little boy and he was the only person who wasnt a douchebag but he wasnt even interesting his mom was dead and his dad hadnt seen him a year so like I really like supposed to feel a little bad for him or something but they gave him no no character like he had no character development whatsoever he was just like a plot device for this other guy to start acting like a father figure and he was just stupid but then he didnt even act like a father figure towards him he was just like oh I shall be your father figure but then I realize I should be a father to my own son goodbye child and Harrison Ford from the trailers for some reason I got the idea that he was a sheriff but he was actually complete douchebag who just ran the town with his business Daniel Craigs character so he had like amnesia right like an am someone who has amnesia like usually theyre like really confused just like you know vulnerable and this guy was like the complete opposite he didnt know what was going on so he just killed everyone he met like I dont know whats going on Im confused so Im just gonna kill you all why are you killing everyone it just some people were like oh hes so cool hes so awesome like youve never seen that in the movie this person who had amnesia just kills everybody even if its like but that was so unnecessary whay are you killing these people you dont even know whats going on like dude get over yourself he looked awesome while he did it but yeah OK so let all the girls who want all disagree with me coz they all think this is an amazing movie but they all think he was amazing because they were staring at Daniel Craig the whole time theyr going oh my gosh hes so hot all the guys that went were pretty much on my page they were just like wow that was stupid wow so I sat with the guys the girls set up higher than I did I sat with the guys and we all try to stay awake through it um and kept falling asleep and then talk about how stupid it was it was Cowboys and aliens but theres a reason they didnt call it cowboys versus aliens coz the cowboys and the aliens they dont they barely even fight at all coz thay cant like the cowboys s stand no chance all it is is like Daniel Craigs character has this thing that can blow them up oh goody for him then they get Indians involved and the Indians the ca,0

87,vvZ4IcEtiZc.wav,hello youre watching watch this fucking movie my name is jen and i will be reviewing blue valentine for you today so i saw blue valentine in theatres a while back and i really really loved it and i thought that the performances in it were incredible and i was just thinking about um how its the performances in it were sort of over overlooked at the academy awards because um there were so many great movies that came out this year i mean um the kings speech black swan 127 hours inception and uh if im missing any im sorry um theyre just off the top of my head but there were a lot of great movies out this year some of the great performances um of last year were kind of overlooked cuz there were just so many of them and i think that blue valentine has um become kind of underrated so blue valentine is about a married couple on the verge of uh you know a collapse they are they used to be in love they were in love and they have a child together but um as you see from the beginning of the movie everything just seems to be falling apart like they dont seem to be connecting anymore um theres no communication between the two of them so the husband played by ryan gosling um decides to take his wife whos pl played by michelle williams uh they go up to some kind of sleazy hotel to as like a last ditch attempt to finally connect again as they used to when they were younger and as this movie uh progresses you co you sort of see these flashbacks of uh when they were first met and the kind of love that uh that was between them at the at the initial stages of their relationship and its truly heartbreaking to see that contrasted with the state of things uh in the present when you see them you know they they almost hate each other and you see the husband trying to reach out to his wife but the wife um it seems like she cant even stand him she cant really stand being around him and she um doesnt respect him and smacking lips all sorts of things and theres a lots of smacking lips theres so many dynamics going on with this relationship and i think that it was it was a great story so uh blue valentine what did i think of it it was after i got out of the theatre I sort of thought to myself wow ive seen so many movies about broken relationships about couples that are on the verge of divorce and its sort of like a contrived plot thats been used over and over again because its um its an audience pleaser you know an especially when it comes to romantic dramas like thumping its uh it gets the audiences to theatres because its a compelling idea but its been uh done,0
88,vyB00TXsimI.wav,I appologize that I have been kind of neglecting movie reviews lately because things have been really really busy but I do wanna tell you about Priest Priest stars Paul Bettany Its based on a graphic novel and it is crazy basically priests are trained to kill vampires and they are super awesome they basically have super human abilities when it comes down to it if you were looking for a movie that has anything realistic in it you should not be looking at this movie because it is insane if you like explosions really ridiculous action sequences malodramatic plot and acting this is the right movie to see the premise is that Paul Bettanys character is contacted about the kidnapping of a young girl from a Wasteland community and he has a connection to this girl through family and he wants to get her back because he knows shes been kidnapped by vampires even though the church who is like big brother within the cities will not allow it and theyre denying the vampires continue to exist so off he goes breaks bonds with church goes out in search of the girl Maggy Cue is a priest and shes sent out after him and she also has pretty sweet moves and is fun to watch some really fun touches within the movie is that two vampires in other shows appear in this movie not as vampires one of them is Steven Moyer who you know as vampire Bill from True blood he plays the father of the kidnapped girl young fellow that plays sheriff Hicks was the vampire that kidnapped Bella in the first Twilight movie and he is helping look for the kidnapped girl as well therere also two Lord of the rings grads which I absolutely love and anyone who knows me knows the Lord of the rings trilogy is probably my favorite movie ever if all three of them were put together yeah thats about how my favorite list goes but Carl Urban plays Black hat Black hat is a former priest and Brad Durraff who was Wormtongue in the Lord of the rings serie plays salesman which basically means hes Wormtongue again in a different way other notable mentiones are Christopher Plumber plays the monk senior whos like the head of the church and Lily Collins plays Lucy the kidnapped girl and she is a really pretty girl the last time we saw her was probably in the blind side this is one of my favorite types of movies I really love the melodramatic over the top crazy action sort of thing going on theres s scene in a cave where they fight a giant monster that really reminds me of like some sort of Lord of the Rings mines of moria moment and theres a better on top of the train fights than the first mission impossible movie so yes I really enjoyed it I thought it was fun and I enjoyed myself a lot at the movie I laughed at quite a bit of the dialogue and there actually was one scene that I found kin,0
89,wMbj6ajWbic.wav,and Im gonna give you a review of JI Joe Rise of the Cobra hissing anyway I actually missed this movie when it came out in xxx because I really wanted to see it actually but I never was able to kind of connect and actually see it some things felt through never was able to see it just saw it on DVD rented it and um first of all I I actually was never a huge fan of the JI Joe TV series or big collector of the action figures um I watched a TV show every once in a while but I wasnt big on it um that being said I still got a lot of references that theyve made in the movie they even may a reference that said noone is half the battle and just in case you didnt read the above thing on my title this review is gonna have some spoilers in it so if you havent seen the movie and you dont want me to spoil it you can watch my other video right now go click on that and watch that and um you know enjoy yourself with that video going back to JI Joe Rise of the Cobra um this movie is incredible cheezy but in the good way I in ist theres two types of cheezy and this is the good kind of cheezy yes it the acting is a little rough in some parts well you know um corny but the m the script is corny I mean the way its written is corny I mean I didnt go to this movie expecting to see the dark night and quite honestly I wish Ive seen this over the summer because if Ive seen it over the summer I probably wouldve rated it best action movie I saw this summer this summer was kind of weird with the action movies if you ask me I did like Transformers 2 even though a lot of people didnt like that but you know this movie um this really um wouldve made up for a disappointment that it had a terminator salvation um um this movie stars Channing Tatum um Marlon Wayans um Sienna Miller Christopher Eccleston Dennis Quaid and Rachel Nichols and um you know you have a lot of good actors in this movie actually a lot of good actors in you know theyre in there this is a cheezy um movie so you know its not like you actually getting like Academy Award quality acting performances um and now the performances are like something like to write home about um that being said you can tell that lot people were having fun with this and theres a difference between when an actor is dulling in a performance and when actor is having fun with the performance and I xxx like in particular Joseph Joseph GordonLevitt had a lot of fun with his role I think um Rachel Nichols had a lot of fun with her role Marlon Wayans had a lot of fun um I cannot pronounce his name but the guy from Lost had a lot of fun Dennis Quaid I think had a lot of fun um same with Christopher Eccleston so I I think it was cool to actually see Ray Park in action great action star he does a great job with his snake eyes which is always cool to see that um one thing I also like to add about this JI Joe movie is how international it was it was very divert,0
90,yDtzw_Y-7RU.wav,and i saw this movie just last night here is my review so much to say about this film but let me first say this i liked it more than i expected i would that said lets hit it this film is slavishly devoted to the original book or nov novella uh by uh charles dickens the language the words i mean the script comes directly from uh charles dickens original writing that means a lot of things number one it means its much scarier than you could imagine my 8 year old was terrified through part of this because the original version is terrifying uh number two ive heard a couple people talk about the christianity of this film let me say this if your christianity is extremely legalistic this is the film for you cause this is a film that basically says you know what you should do you should take care of poor people because jesus told us to take care of poor people and if you dont take care of poor people youre gonna burn in hell so laughing if thats your form of christianity its a christian film um its not my form so do with that as you please um another thing about this film is in its devotion is that sometimes my children could not understand what was being said because they were speaking dickensonian english sometimes i missed what was being said uh another thing is that charles dickens was making real social commentary on victorian england of his day therefore a lot of social commentary goes woop sound effect over your head or just really doesnt make any difference to us today at all um all this stuff about debtors prison for instance doesnt really um jive here in 21st century america now the animation of the film the thing about disney is that disney makes amusement park rides and this film is this amazing like i say slavish devotion to charles dickens with an amusement park ride it involved because this thing is is meant to be seen in 3D which i saw it in and throughout the film youre going sound effects laughing either from the terrifying characters or most likely from going very quickly through london with you know demon horses chasing you so uh theres that also about the animation the people just like in polar express a film i really did not like um the people seemed sort of dead you know everyones like yes welcome to the polar express except their eyes are kind of like this welcome to the polar express whatever now all those things being said and thats a lot to be said for a one minute review i actually like the film um i enjoyed myself in it you might as well i would not take a young child,0
91,yvsjCA6Y5Fc.wav,Robin Hood starring Russel Crow um first thing I got to say xxx I was dreading going in to see this movie the trailers werent really doing it much for me see neither are folks too much on epic than you know character development of this timeless tale that is Robin Hood and also therere these reviews I was reading about it I maen I think the most generous review Ive read give it two out of five so I really was not looking forward to seeing this movie um but I guess say maybe my expectations were lowered by these other reviews that I read but I didnt mind it to be honest with you um I know its been a really just getting nail to cross as far as I you know movies going on a film festival right now but I didnt find it all that bad I didnt find it all that good like I said maybe my expectations were lowered because of all of those reviews but I really didnt hate it um I guess well start right off like what people could hate about this movie there are some negatives to say the least um really first and foremost it just lacked the charm of these past Robin Hood movies that we know I mean there was this classic Disney verstion which everyone watched when we were kids um theres men in tights which you know hilarious spoof of the story theres a Kevin Costner prince of fee version which was supposed to be the dark and edgy version of his time I mean but that was what thirteen years ago fourteen years ago probably more than that so maybe in Hollywoods eyes it was time for a remake and it just lacked the charm of those past movies it did seem to focus too much on epic epic epic and it really just lacked what made the other movies more enjoyable and suffers from what I call kingdom of heaven syndrom where it builds too much for these huge catastrophic war sequences theyre supposed to blow you away but the problem is you dont give a damn because it just lacks that charm of the past movies um not in all instances but the ones that matter the most yeah um Russel Crow and Cate Blanchette just did not sell it for me I had a very hard time just buying it like were supposed to believe that these two are in their mid wel you know mid thirties at the oldest and laughter theyre looking pretty rough in this movie like OK yeah Russel Crow is Robin Hood whos a crusaider and hes got back from a crusaids I can appreciate that hes not gonna be looking like a chipper bright young man but early thirties really you want me to buy that I cant do it especially when hes hanging around with a married men who all but one of them are probably early twenties laughter and one of them is maybe mid twenties and meanwhile theyre hanging in with papa Russel it just looks like you know its bunch of a guys hanging there so one brought dad along coz he offered to drive,0
92,zhpQhgha_KU.wav,hey guys I told you that I would make a review for the movie Sex and the city 2 whats Im gonna do Im gonna start off with saying that I really wasnt very impressed with the movie um I watched a lot of the series and I own the first movie and I liked the first movie I thought the first movie was really good but this movie kind of came off like somebodys really sad travel video I dont know I mean that sounds really harsh but I just wasnt I just I dont know I didnt really like the movie all that much I mean I had some some good moments and a few funny parts but all in all I just thought it was really over overly sad I dont know I just thought I just thought it was really really sad um I mean if you really like the show and you really liked the first movie and you still wanna go and see this Im not gonna discourage you from seeing it I just personally I just didnt really enjoy it um it also really didnt need a lot of the things that it had in it like it couldve been shorter um its like over two hours but a lot of the footage was kind of unnecessary and I mean I dont know I just I feel like I dont mean if I have wasted those two hours I just feel like I couldve done something better with them I think that Charlotte and Miranda have some really nice moments in the movie I really think that I really like the Mirandas character actually the most upbeat character in the whole movie I think that um and that everybody I do feel really bad for Charlotte she does have a lot of issues and you really can kind of symphatize whether youve got to have kids I mean even if you dont have kids because its just just about getting getting time for yourself and not being really stressed out and I think that thats thats a very relatable issue I think that they all have like a lot of issues and that some are very relatable yeah I mean it it has some fun moments but all in all wasnt really that big of a fan I mean Im not gonna do like a spoiler section Im not gonna like and indeapth thing because there really wasnt all that much to it for me um like I said if you like it feel free to go see it I just personally wasnt that into it um yeah I mean if you wanna see a video um its gonna be who enjoyed a film if you do wanna see somebody whos possibly critiquing it Ill put a link for for the video um somewhere up here um its by um its Jill Strip and she really enjoyed the film um so if you like to hear a um like more positive review check out her review it is very good um just two of us in opinions but yeah I wanna talk about La rue for a second major laser I dont know if you guys are familiar with major laser but major laser and la rue and various others have collaborated um,0
