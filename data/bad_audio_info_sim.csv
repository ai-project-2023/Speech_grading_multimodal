1,0h-zjBukYpk.wav,huh huh OK OK hello this is xxx man eleven here for review of XMen Origins Wolverine throat cleaning starring Hugh Jackman Liev Schreiber Danny Houston Ryan Reynolds Will I am and Taylor Kitsch and yes I just watched this a week ago most specifically July 27 so who ran off for over 3 dollar theater showings now the title of the movie basically says it all the movie shows the origins and backstory of famed Xman member Wolverine now Im not even gonna sugar coat this this movie frustrated me to such an extreme extent that I was loudly exclaiming why at the end of the film my reason Im a comic book fan that like to see comic book characters treated responsibly that huh before we go on with that I must say that this had a surprisingly decent cast strange since one of my biggest grapes with the Xman series was and always is the xxx now Hugh Jackman was always the best choice to play Wolverine I will admit that and in my opinion he carried the movie fine you know nothing great but you know he did it hes a star of the movie nothing special he carried it um also Liev Schreiber or Schreiber um I like calling him Liev Schreiber um is Victor Creed otherwise best known as Sabertooth which shes not called once in the whole movie which is a smart move since you know you have to be real comic book fan to get what hes name is supposed to be but its pretty selfexplanatory but going on um I actually think that Liev Schreiber is a good actor and he almost looks exactly the same as this character in Defiance I mean it was like he was too lazy to take off the costume or something now other performances are borderline OK but the two big character appearances in this movie are easily Deadpool and Gambit um Deadpool being Ryan Raynolds and Gambit being played by Taylor Kitsch Taylor Kitsch yes Ryan Raynolds has eleven minutes of screen time maximum actually I liked him a lot and I thought he made a good actor for the dead poor character now hes seen at the beginning that really sold me I mean that was impressive I liked that scene where he had a swords in there and theres bunch of people that are gonna shoot him boom boom boom boom take him down take him down bam bam bam bam bam take that with my magical swords,0,hello is this man living here for you next man Origins Wolverine. William and yes I just watched this a week ago most specifically July 27th showings. know what the title of the movie basically says it all the movie shows the origins and backstory of famed X-Men member. I'm not going to sugarcoat this this movie to such an extreme extreme y at the end of my reason I'm a comic books and that like to see comic book characters treated responsibly. before we go on with that I must say that this had a surprisingly decent cast strange the X-Men series was and always is the castic national Jackman was always the best choice to play Wolverine I will admit that and you know nothing great he's the star of the movie nothing special is Victor Creed otherwise known as Sabertooth when she's not called once in the comic books what his name is supposed to be. but it's pretty self-explanatory almost exactly the same as his character in Defiance it was like he was too lazy to take off the costumer something borderline okay but the two big character appearances in this movie screen time maximum character. no just seen that with my magical sword,0.5859375,0.5859

And I mean was it was okay just average station off the book to the original source.. Gives it its flaws because he was moving around completely depressed wasn't the best starting read budget. it was still the ACT 90 moments with the script and emotion from the characters to be exposed through Dialogue on the tactic of blinking a lot but she really does. that was most exciting that the entire film the rest of the film was just watching Kristen just saying but,0.65625,0.6562

5,2iD-tVS8NPw.wav,hey welcome to stuffwelikecom video review of the Green Lantern stuff we like before I went in to see the Green Lantern Ive been hearing all these like critics basically just trashing this movie left and right I wasnt entirely sure why exactly I didnt read what they had written about the Green lantern and what they overall their thoughts were on this movie and still I I Ive yet to as of this review but I at the same time I do wanna just say that I enjoyed this movie I enjoyed it for what it was you know its a huge sort of spectacle movie that is great for this summer time you know this is a movie that youre gonna go out and see and you wanna see it in 3D because I I would actually say this probably is one of the first movies this year that Ive seen this year that you wanna see in 3D especially for just the opening portion it looks really good and the rest of it does look good as well and I just had fun watching this movie its not like a dark movie or anything its very much a light hearted so its perfect for kids as well as just like teenagers as well who just wanna see a lot of explosions and some crazy stuff and you know going into it or these watching the trailers before head I was really kind of hesitant about seeing the Green lantern in the first place because it looks like a cartoon Im not really a huge fan of having like all these 3D characters because I think why not just make this you know movie this live action movie and talk cartoon thats really the route that youre gonna go and it seemed like they were gonna go that route but I think there was also some sort of like um tone within the actual um powers of the green lantern and himself and that you can basically think up of anything and you can project that into the real life and I think having this sort of superpower almost this power to just imagine anything kind of just um helped me get passed that you know these are all CGI characters and set this is a playground and their imaginary playground and anything can happen anything that what also made the film exciting because you dont entirely know whats coming next the entire movie is about building up towards this ultimate battle of this force that is so powerful and they dont even know how to defeat it its that powerful you know its the darkest force ever right but then you kind of like walk out of the movie and youre like well I I get what happened I understand what happened but what what would you do for Green Lantern movie 2 that would be even like worth while now because I mean if hes able to do all of this sort of stuff like how youre supposed to really put up a force that can push him to the next level or or destroy him at the same time during the credit sequence they do have a scene that basically explains what potentially speaking the Green lantern 2 might be about and it does kind of a lea helps alleviate what that whole was is about fighting the ultimate enemy within this first movie and that the threat is still there potentially speaking so its kind of interesting to see um where theyre gonna be going with that Im looking forward to it Ive got to say its not like the Green lantern is the next Batman begins or or the Dark nighter,0,Play Welcome this stuff we like. Cam video review of the Green Lantern really sure why the Green Lantern a huge obstacle movies this is a movie that you're actually said this problem of the first movies this year just the opening it looks really good and I just seen this movie so it's perfect for kids. oceans and some crazy stop and skip the first cartoon 3D characters because I think I just make this this live action movie in there was also some sort of like the actual song of the Green Lantern himself you can basically just help me get past this is a plate. what happened I understand what happened to that would be even like we supposed to really put up a force that can push him to the next level or orange destroy him at the same time play speaking the Green Lantern 2 months to help alleviate pain is still there potentially speaking so it's kind of interesting to see where they're going to be going with the Green Lantern is the next,0.6119791269302368,"[:512][-512:]0.5365,0.6875"

11,8OtFthrtaJM.wav,hey hows it going guys I went to go see the Adjustment Bureau Friday so I thought Id give you guys a review for those of you who may have not seen it and maybe wished to see it right just as a little synopsis the main character played by Matt Damon he falls in love with the girl in a bathroom which is where all great relationships should start um you know these two people fall in love with each other but theres this higher organization called the adjustment bureau and they try to adjust adjust their lives each other persons life to keep them away from each other because that what it says in the plan this plan that they are following so Matt Damon um desides not to do that and he wants to live with the girl anyways and so you know hes trying to run away from the adjustment bureau and theyre theyre chasing him and theres running theres a lot of doors opening and closing and theres fedoras and just its very its very chaotic at the end of this movie I literally said out loud what que what is this movie that I am seeing what is this I do not understand this movie but theres a reason for that theres a reason for why I was confused first off the commercial makes the terrible terrible mistake of saying that it is more thought provoking than Inception thanks a lot commercial the entire time I was constantly comparing it to Inception but I must say those are some pretty big shoes to fill so I thought maybe it has a chance I I should give it a shot you know I was just waiting for Joseph Gordon Levitt to come out just jump out any time and say its a paradox now the only suspensful part that I found in the first thirty minutes of the movie was when Matt Damon first discovers the Bureau in the first place you know ther theres a lot of confusion theres scuffling he hes trying to run away from them end up catching him and then they explain their purpose to him as to why they are there which kind of just ruins the suspense right there because if youve got some convenient guy in a fedora to just tell you oh yes we are the adjustement bureau and this is what we do you know its just kind of ruins the suspense and now Im not Im not excited anymore interestingly it turned out to be more of a romantic comedy than it was a thriller um you know it had some interesting writing you know it was it was funny at times Matt Damon is a you know hes a pretty funny guy but just aside from that they really dropped the ball on the suspensful parts overall overall it had far too many plot holes and just not enough depth to be interesting I have to say my favorite character in the entire movie is the character Thompson if you go see the movie youll see him but hes just the creepiest old guy youll ever see in your life he stands over people when theyre asleep just staring at them just imagine if youre in your bed sleeping and getting your dream on whatever you do you know and theres just someone standing at the foot of your bed just,0,"how's it going guys I went to go see The Adjustment Bureau on Fridays so I thought I'd give you guys a review for those of you who are the main characters in the bathroom cuz we're all great relationship should starve each other organization called The Adjustment Bureau and they try to adjust to each other person has to keep them away from each other and he wants to live with the girl anyways and so you know he's trying to run away from The Adjustment Bureau and there's a lot of clothes. at the end of this movie but there's a reason for that there's a reason for why I was confused first off the commercial makes the terrible terrible mistake of saying that it is thanks a lot commercial entire time I was constantly comparing it to Inception but I must say those are some pretty big shoes to fill so I thought maybe I was just waiting for Joseph Gordon-Levitt to come out to jump out at any time. suspenseful part that I found in the first 30 minutes of the movie first discovers the bureau in the first place you know there is a lot of confusion there's scuffling trying to run away from a guy in a fedora to just tell you anymore it turned out to be more of a romantic, Thriller interesting writing aside from that they really dropped the ball on the overall overall. Fire movie is the character Thompson if you go see the movie is just the creepiest guy ever seen your life stands over people when they're asleep just staring at them just imagine if you're in your bed sleeping",0.69921875,

18,Af8D0E4ZXaw.wav,Before I get to the substance of my review Id like to clear up a couple of things First the fact that Im wearing on of my new Marvell geek shirts as Im giving this review is a coincidence and secondly Im going to throw out the spoiler alert I cant express my thoughts and feelings about this movie adequatly without describing some specific things in the third act of the movie which is spoilerific so so if you havent seen the movie and you stick it out through this entire movie video and I end ups saying something that ruins it for you youve been warned Now to the subject of this review Green Lantern starring Ryan Reynolds Blake Lively Peter Sarsgaard Mark Strong among others this was a big event for DC and for Warner Brothers and for superhero fans everywhere Big for Warner Brother because it had a huge production budget and was potentially seen um as the first step of a series of xxx towards justice league movie It was widely believed that a sucess of Green Lantern movie would lead Warner Brothers to adapt the Flash and Wonder woman among possibly others and put them in a justice leage movie with the ritual Batman and Superman So not only that this movie have to deal with the burden of telling its own selfcontained story and setting up its own inevitable sequels it had to deal with the expectations of potentially setting up all that others stuff And how did it do Yeah not good to all the green lantern fans out there I am so sorry I say that for two reasons First because someone owes you an appologie and Warner Brothers is never gonna give you one And secondly because as a Marvell geek I have experienced my fair share of disappointments over the last decade and I can genuinly symphatize with you Before I get to the negatives of the movie let me list off a few of the positives i love Jeffrey Rush and Michael Clarke Duncan as the voice actors They do a great job with their roles They are great additions I also love the casting of Mark Strong as Sinestro Hes perfect for that role and um finally a particular stand out scene for me was the fighter jet sequence It was by far my favorite action seen in the movie I thought it was really well put together and um I thought it worked worked pretty well Um and in fact in spite of all the negatives Im about to mention I thought the movie was working for a while for about the first third um but at the end of act one two significant things happened Hactor Hummand arrives and starts chewing scenery like its a two dollar steak and how Jordan flies off to the green lantern core planet oh and the movie starts sequel baiting These two developments together caused what was up to that point a noble effort to start falling apart at the seams and it was painful to watch I dont even know why I really should begin with listing off the negatives but Im going to start with a few of the superficial things The acting ranges from mediocrity to hamfisted from the live action actors but I cant really blame them for that because a few of them are acting for entire sequences entire lantern for green screens This is Star Wars prequal territory The acting is not that bad but still its that kind of movie making and and you know I wasnt expecting good acting out of,0,before I get to the substance of my review I'd like to clear up a couple of things first the fact that I'm wearing one of my new Marvel t-shirts and I'm getting this review is a coincidence and secondly I'm going to throw out the boiler alert so I can see the movie. no to the subject of this review Green Lantern starring Ryan Reynolds Blake Lively and four Warner Brothers a superhero found everywhere. Big 4 Warner Brothers because it had a huge production budget and was potentially seen as the first step of a series of X Tour de Justice League would leave Warner Brothers to adapt The Flash and Wonder Woman among possibly others and have to deal with the burden of telling its own self-contained story it had to deal with the expectations of potentially setting up how did it do experience my fair share disappointments with you before I get to the negatives of the movie Let me hear positive. Mark Strong is Sinestro he's perfect for that role and finally a particular Stand Out seeing my favorite action scene in the movie I thought was really well put together and I thought it works works pretty well and in fact in spite of all the negative but at the end of act one two significant arrives and starts chewing the scenery like it's $2 steak and how Jordan flies off and Green Lantern Corps planet of star sequel baiting these two developments together called what was up to that point a noble effort is falling apart at the seams and it was too painful to watch. I don't even know where I really should begin when listing off the negative but I'm going to start with a few superficial thing the acting ranges from mediocre to Hampstead from the live-action actors so I can't really blame them for back because a few of them are acting for entire sequences in Thailand from this is Star Wars prequels to the movie making and I wasn't expecting,0.62890625,

20,BXuRRbG0Ugk.wav,Cowboys and Aliens metaphoricaly speaking is like one of those NFL teams that has the talent to be a super bowl champion but instead ends up being a wild cart team that just gets dismissed in the first round of playoffs yeah job pretty well done I mean it wasnt a bad year but there was a lot of potential left on the table And that describes Cowboys and Aliens pretty well Though I guess I should be grateful that it turned out as good as it did because given all the strikes that it had going against before wonder production it could have been much much worse Fortunally some good decisions were made before the camara started rolling Jon Favreau was hired to direct and Daniel Craig and Harisson Ford were cast as the lead roles but this probably had the unfortunate side effect of raising bad expectations to unreasonable levels When I saw the first trailer back in November of last year this movie immediately shot up near the top of my list of must see movies for 2011 The final product ultimately doesnt live up to the high order of that first trailer but its still a pretty enjoyable ride if you go in wanting to see a bunch of cowboys battle a bunch of aliens yeah youll pretty much get your fill but if thats all youre looking for youll actually miss the best thing about this movie Jon Favreau is probably not the guy that I would hire if I was looking for a director for an action movie I mean yeah hes a competent action director hes action sequences are certainly a lot better than the incoherent impossible to follow slope that we see in a typical Michael Bay movie but its action isnt particulary memorable I mean lets look at his track record Hes directed three big action movies in the last three years Two Ironman films and now this And the action wasnt the most memorable thing about any on those movies The ironman films are fondly remembered mostly for Robert Doweny Jr Not the action And the same thing has more or less happened here yeah thats right the movie called Cowboys and Aliens Daniel Craig steels the whole damn show hes playing a variation of the iconic man with no name character that was made famous by Clint Eastwood and now that Ive seen him in the role I cant imagine any other current actor trying ot pull it off He is perfect from start to finsih Harisson Ford is a long for the ride and having a blast as the second lead and the cast is pretty well rounded out with suppordting performance from guys like Sam Rockwell as the Doc Theyre all playing cliched stock western characters but I really dont care that the characters are walking cliches when they are this well done and the actors do such a good job of carrying of their particular arcs Cowboys and Aliens problem is the screenplay Six different people got writing credit for this movie and the results are exactly what you would expect the story,0,Cowboys & Aliens metaphorically speaking to be a Super Bowl champion job pretty well and that describes Cowboys & Aliens pretty well so I guess I should be grateful dead because given all the strikes that had going against it before 12 production it could have been much worse much worse fortunately some good decisions were made before the cameras started rolling Jon Favreau was hired to direct and Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford were cast as the lead roles probably had the unfortunate side effect of raising fan expectations too unreasonable level when I saw the first trailer back in November of last year this movie immediately shot up near the top of my list of must-see movies for 2011. the final product ultimately doesn't live up to the hype order that first trailer but it's still a pretty enjoyable ride if you go in wanting to see a bunch of cowboys battle a bunch of aliens it yourself but if that's all you're looking for you. Jon Favreau is probably not the guy that I would hire if I was looking for a director for an action he's a competent action director his action sequences are certainly a lot better than the incoherent impossible to follow swap what is action is Big action movies last 3 years to Iron Man films and now this wasn't the most memorable thing about any of the Iron Man films are fondly remembered mostly for Robert Downey jr. The accents and the same thing has more or less happened here that's right. he's playing A variation of the iconic man with no name character that was made famous by Clint Eastwood and now that I've seen him in the role he is perfect from start to finish Harrison Ford is along for the ride and having a blast as the second one and the cast is pretty well-rounded out with supporting performances from guys like Sam Rockwell as the docks They're all playing doc Western characters really don't care if the characters are walking play well done by The Afters do such a good job of carrying out their particular our problem is the screenplay six different people. Writing credit for this movie and the results are exactly what you would expect the store,0.7135416269302368,

22,BioHAh1qJAQ.wav,Im a big fan of the first Tron Um i thought this is the perfect time to have a Tron sequel because um in at the beginning of the 1980s people thought that computers can do every every anything and everything and now technology actually does anything and everything because it kinda controls our lives so it was the perfect time for a Tron sequel unfortunately um the writers and I were not exactly on the same wavelength lip smacking but I will say that the first third of this movie is amazing its the best summer movie Ive seen all year but you know the pacing is so good it gets straight into the story you have lots of uh references to the first movie you know you have recurring characters you have new characters that actually have a connection to the old ones and once Sam Flynn enters the grid you know the soundtrack draws you in the special effects look amazing uh they dont waste a lot of time on exposition because the minute the soundplane enters the grid he is put in the games and let me tell you the games look great all those action sequences in involving the games were great to watch um the cho the choreography of the fights the special effects I was so happy to be back in the grid that I wasnt really thinking about the story or where the story was going but then sam flynn meets his father and Tron basically turns into a star wars prequel after that one disconnection then that happens at that point because uh the old flynn the original flynn starts going on and on about these kinds of aliens not aliens artifical intelligence i guess that he found on the grid and he just pulls them the writers just pull this out of their ass and the whole movie becomes about these crazy i i isos theyre calles ISOs and its just like or why do we need these things it doesnt make any sense because anyway they get purged at some point because when the old Flynn finds these things whatever they are theyre so wise and naive kinda like Navi now that I think about it clue which is the program that he created in the first movie kinda pulls a bunny in the boiler moment in the sense that he turns into a crazy jealous psycho stalker bitch and clue has to be one of the most idiotic villains ever cause what is a what is clue clue is a computer program and he wants to take all the programs that are now under his control and put them in the real world for some kind of freaky teleportation or whatever so basically you have this computer program that wants to create a physical army on the planet and its like youre a computer program okay if you want to take over the world using real people its the worst way you could possibly do that infiltrate some computer system somewhere and detonate some nukes or something,0,I see because I'm a big fan of the first one I've had this is the perfect time to have a Tron sequel because at the beginning of the 1980s people for their computers and you and every anything and everything and now acknowledge actually does anything and everything because it kind of controls our lives so it was a perfect time for Tron sequel unfortunately the writers and I were not exactly on the same wavelength but I will say that the first Ford of this movie is amazing it's the best summer movie I've seen all year but you know the pacing is so good and get straight into a story you have a lots of references to the first movie you know you have recurring characters you have new characters that they have a connection to the old one and for once Campland enters the Grid in all the soundtrack draws you in the special effects look amazing they don't wake up. I'm on Exposition because the minute the family under the great he is put in the game and then kill the games look great all those action sequences involving the games were great to watch the fights the special effects I was so happy to be back in the grid that I was really thinking about the story or whether the story was going but then dance when he meets his father and Tron basically turned into a Star Wars prequel after that one connection that happens at that point because the old fling your original plan starts going on and on about these kinds of aliens not even artificial intelligence I guess that he found on the grid and he just pulled in the writers just pulled it out of their ass and the holy becomes about these crazy-ass I suppose they're called I as foes and it's just like why do we need be. things it doesn't make any sense because anyway get purged at some point because when the Oakland find these things whatever they are they are so wise and naive kind of like Navi now that I think about it which is a program that he created in the first movie kind of pulls a bunny in the boiler moment in the sense that he turned into a crazy jealous psycho soccer pitch and cool has to be one of the most idiotic villains ever cuz what is what is clue clue is a computer program and she wants to take all the programs that are now under his control and put them in the real world for some kind of freaky teleportation or whatever so we can do you have this computer program to create a physical Army on the planet and it's like a computer program okay if you want to take over the world using real people it's the worst way you can possibly do that infiltrate some computer system somewhere and that's Nate's,0.6471353769302368,

24,Ci-AH39fi3Y.wav,I just got back from the midnight showing of Saw 5 and I have to review before I go to sleep because Im still excited about it But I just want to let you guys know that the first part of this review will not have any spoilers and also you dont have to worry about it being ruind for you And the second half of this video is going to have spoilers but I will warn you beforehand so you can close out the video and than after you see Saw 5 you can come back and watch the spoilers Also be very vary of the comments underneath the video I would suggest that if you havent seen Saw 5 you shouldnt go to the comments because people are going to be commenting about the ending and stuff So if you havent seen Saw 5 dont check out the comments on this video either So hopefully you got all that now lets talk about Saw 5 As some of you might not notice I was extremly excited about Saw 5 OK all of you knew that obviously So I was you know really hyped up and excited to see it and I have to say that it was definately better than the Saw 4 not exectly what I was expecting but it was still really really really good and um its just made me really really excided for Saw 6 Now there were two plots going on in this movie One of them was great and the other one was completely irrelevant as far as I can tell The great plot was with Hoffman tying up all loose ends and stuff and the irrelevant plot was with five rendom strangers kind of like in Saw 2 who um you know have to go through these traps and stuff But I totally missed how it tied it to the movie at all and Im pretty sure thats because it didnt tie in to the movie at all So that was really bizzare and I didnt care about the characters at all because they werent you know introduced well really So it was just really really strange but luckily Hoffmans story um was a really really really awesome and um it totally made up for that so thats OK Of course as everyone knows the tag line of Saw 5 was you wont believe how it ends And I guess thats sort of true because I sure didnt see the end coming Im not gonna spoil it dont worry But the end was really you you know the Saw movies are known for it bigh twist endings and stuff but I thought the best part of Saw 5 was the storyline like in general Everything leading up to the ending the ending was not you know crazy shocking or anything like usual It was not a real huge Saw twist moment um so you know that was a little surprising I guess Thats not to say that the ending wasnt good because it really was but it was not exectly what I was expecting and se seriously everything leading up to the end was better than the ending which is still good because the movie is good Saw 5 has left like no closure at all at the end of the movie and it pretty much just left the door wide open for Saw 6 which obviously is already scheduled to come out next year So you know we knew it was coming and everything but man oh man it really left the door open and it didnt even you know try to close it at all like the wind isnt gonna blow it over or anything Its just open But like I said the plot of Hoffman and everything that was really really awesome and it fit very well into the Saw series in my opinion So congratulations to the writers for that But Ill smack them in the face for the other irrelevant plotline and dont know what the hell they were thinking It was pretty much just and excuse to put traps in the movie because it was literally completely irrelevant But whatever Like I said I loved the Hoffmans storyline so you know I guess it balances out David Hackl directed this movie and it was his first time directing a movie I think in general,0,I just got back from the midnight showing stop by before I go to sleep because I'm still excited about it so you don't have to worry about it being in the second half of this video is going to have spoilers but I will warn you beforehand so you can close out of the video and then after you see stuff like you can come back and watch the spoilers I would suggest if you haven't seen sulfide you shouldn't go to the comment because people are going to be commenting about the ending and stuff so if you haven't seen stuff I don't check out the comments on this video either so hopefully you got all that talk about stuff I've got somebody might not notice but I was extremely excited about soft 50k all of you knew that obviously so I was in a really hyped up and excited to see you and I have to say it was definitely better than the stuff or not exactly what I was expecting it was still really really really good and it's just made me really really excited for Sussex. play irrelevant as far as I can tell the great spot was with Hoffman tying up all the Loose Ends and stuff and the irrelevant plot was with five random strangers kind of like it's not too you don't have to go to the straps and stuff I totally missed Howard tied into the movie at the movie at all at all because they were all really so it was just really really strange but luckily Hoffman's story was a really really really awesome totally made up for that so it's okay and I guess who the true because I sure didn't see the end the end the song movies are known for their big twist endings and stuff but I thought that the best part of stuff I was the storyline like in general everything leading up to the ending the ending was not crazy shocking or anything like usual. is that a huge star twist moment seriously everything was better than the ending which is still good because obviously is already scheduled to come out next year so we really left the door open it didn't even try to close it at all that was really really awesome. In my opinion so congratulations to the writers for that because it was literally completely irrelevant,0.6119791269302368,

28,G6GlGvlkxAQ.wav,I wanna give you guys a quick spoiler free review of the movie summer blockbuster I would put money on it that it is going to be the blockbuster hit of the summer in terms of when you look at all the movies I Im a cap guy Captain america fan I think that would do very well but Thor just look at the numbers what it did last night it did three point um two five million just on midnight shows alone over on the opening night I just saw report from Friday the first two days were out um in the lot of theaters had when you look at the imax in 3D and 2D um so I think Thor is really gonna do well I think its gonna catapult Chris Hemsworth to be even a bigger star um I know he already did a remake of Red Dawn um great 80s movie for those who havent seen it originally with Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen by the way Charlie Sheen was winning there and hes winning no um and they actually moved Red dawn back to later this year so they could um um kind of get a little bit of Chris Hemsworth star power into that um great movie overall they did very well to establish the character of Thor the problem with a lot of comic book shows and movies and you saw this with the NBC recent flop of the Cape which is a show I love but the audience that was watching it they needed they needed a pay off right away and they needed character established right away um what you get in the sitcoms in terms of comic books and kind of the movies that take so loud to build that and why is this person wearing tights or why are they carrying a hammer you know why what is their mission or why why are they here you have to establsih that fairly quickly and I think that directors of Thor and the script writers did that right away you saw Thor for how hes in the comics pompous an arogant individual you saw what happens to him you saw how he ends up on Earth um but they also did a great job in building the backstory of Jane Foster played by Natalie Portman and her crew and how they relate to Thor so I think that was really good they didnt belabored Thor on Earth he sounded like he didnt learn from the earthlings um if if you are true Marvel comic fan you know that Thor in the comics thinks hes better because hes a god you know he always makes comments like oh gama radiation can hurt you it cant hurt us guardians were gods and hes right about that so he gets to he gets to Earth and see what happens there all while youre seeing whats going on with xxx and Loki and I think there was another great thing um this is not a spoiler but Marvel has already publicly announced that Loki will be the main bad guy in the adventures which makes sense because if you go back in adventures lower youll see that Loki was originally the reason why the adventures hat to be put together um so that makes sense um so they established Loki the established the relationshop between Thor Loki and Odin um they go back until some of Loki history that would only hard core comic fans know um huh Sif um and um Im forgetting the guy with the red beard I forget his name um um their group they establish they establish everything um they get the Earth you get other whole shield involvement which is cool to see that a lot of cooler references that at one point they reference Im a doctor with gama radiation um which are those moral fans ot all the trouble Petty Gross who was played by Liv Tyler in the Incredible Hulk movie a couple of years ago the refer,0,"what to give you guys a quick spoiler-free review of the movies, Captain America before the first full day without a great evening if you haven't seen it first thing with Patrick Swayze Charlie Sheen so they can get a little bit of Chris Hemsworth. the problem with a comic book shows and movies and shows with very serious and flop of the first I wasn't right away I will you getting sick, what is the ignition wire the here's what happened to him how he ends up a laborer store.

30,HEsqda8_d0Q.wav,So I went to the premiere of the Christmas Carol It was amazing the premiere itself was really cool but Im gonna tell you about that in another video because otherwise this video will be mega mega long This video is about the film itself and I actually liked the film a lot and I wasnt expecting to because I thought how the hell is Dickens and Disney gonna work together like this So kind of opposite but I thought they actually worked pretty well If you dont know the story that well its all about guy this old guy called Scrooge whos really mean and he never spends any money on anyone and I guess visited by these three ghosts the ghost of Christams past the ghost of Christmas present and the ghost of Christmas yet to come and they show him you know what his life has been like what it is like now what is going to be like if he keeps being like he is But yeah than he changes his ways and xxxin the end and the end part is really really funny because hes been such a grumpy character and hes really scared and in the end hes so changed and hes really funny hes like what a delightful child and its all kind of its hard to explain but if you see it than youll understand what I mean the animation was amazing I wasnt expecting that much because sometimes 3D isnt really that good but it was fenomenal you kind of forget about the fact that it is 3D the voices are really good that was one of my other concerns was that as an English person I get really annoyed when American shows and films have an English character but than its so obviously not an English character but yeah generally the accents were really really good so good one you America for doing that hah America the the land that made this film what else I doubt that theyre gonna do this for all the screenings because it was the premiere On each seat there was the um a bottle of water a bar of chocolate and a bag of humbugs I would not have chosen to go and see that but Im really really really glad I saw it and I would recommend it to other people its true even though I was like hu Im gonna hate it but Im just gonna have to say it Its my favorite film ever um its not my favorite film ever but I would definately watch it again I can imagine getting this on DVD and watching it at Christmas at time because it makes you feel so like huh its not about commercialization its about you know families being together Anyway next video is going to be the footage from the thing and Ill tell you all about like the cool premiere and stuff and Im sorry its over the mid way but I just wanted to put this up soon Hes xxxtakes of me trying to make this video early on which were um a disasterous so enjoy and yes see you next video throat cleaning um singing coughing whats wrong with me laughter amazing,0,it's about what it's going to be like to keep. how to explain what is America for doing that it's true.

35,LSi-o-IrDMs.wav,who to review of the Final destination which I did get a chance to see this weekend on Saturday but I didnt have time to review it I wasnt planning on reviewing it but its actually worth talking about because the movie itself is the same old crap from the series and I actually am not finding the series to be very fun and popcorn kind of movie You just cant walk in exopecting anything other than that um you know you got your kid who cen see in the future he sees that everyone all his friends are gonna die in a horrific accident he averts the accident and saves all his friends so you know karma kicks in and death says no Im gonna come get you and you know you cant escape me and um you know one by one they get picked off in the same order they wouldve died in the original accident and you know the main kid it um its its his job to save everyone essentially convince them that its true in this case it didnt take much convincing which is a little silly but the acting is bad the plot is you know actually the acting is OK I guess for this kind of movie the plot is is is threadbare the the um character development is nil but none of those things matter its a fun movie anyway its a popcorn movie and the main thing I wanna talk about is this dolby 3D um its not real D like the normal 3D thats been around recently the with the plastic black kind of buddy holly glasses this is a different kind of glasses and Ill show a picture right now I took it with my cell phone camera which is a terrible picture but hopefuly it will give you an idea what theyre like theyve actually got a little sensor on the side that wont let you leave the theater its like something youde see on article of clothing in the department store um but um this 3D definatelly looks a lot better I think that real D it corrects some of the issues that that had like I I found the real D the image was still sort of misaligned even with the glasses on um and um this this corrects that problem completetly at least where I was sitting I was sitting right in the middle of the theater I had ideal seats because its good to sit right in the middle of the theater with 3D and um at least in my experience it is um but the they looked awesome the 3D itself really had improved it looks like things are actually coming out at you um the color looked great coz sometimes 3D can mess up the color at least the old anaglyphic 3D I think real D it you know had sort of had sort of tempted but it winds itself its also um not ideal for for the imigae itslef um but this looked amazing looked really good and it makes it worth going to see this movie if youve got um the dolby 3D somewhere in your town weve got at the Studio movie grill theater chain in North Texas theyve theyve bought the system and theyve invested millions of dollars into these glasses um so they obviously expected to make a lot of money and I hope this takes over as the new system I would love that that be that would be cool to see I mean eventually were gonna get burned out as a soci as a society once agian were gonna be burned out on 3D because its it is a gimmick ultmatelly um but I will say um with this with this quality of 3D you could almost make you know a regular like a dramatic movie or an action movie or something that was really good movie and you could make it 3D and it wouldnt at all,0,the Final Destination which I did get a chance to see this weekend on Saturday the same old crap from the Series 6 Everyone is always friends going to die in a horrific accident he is a vertice accident and saves all his friends so you know Karma Hixson and Jeff says no I'm going to come get you and then you can't escape me and no one by one they get picked off in the same order they would have died in the accident and. if they take out to save everyone eventually convince them that is true but the plot is real do you like the normal 3D that's been around recently with the plastic black is a terrible picture but he definitely looks a lot better. correct that problem completely at least where I was sitting I was sitting right it was awesome it the previous self really had improved it looks like things are actually coming out at you color looks great too sometimes pretty can mess up the color at least the old and it's also not ideal for for the image itself but this looks amazing and it makes it worth going to see this movie if you got in your town at the studio classes today obviously expect to make a lot of money and I hope this takes over as the new system I would love that. because that's it is a gimmick ultimately and you can make it 3D and it wouldn't at all,0.6315103769302368,

41,Oz06ZWiO20M.wav,hey everybody whats going on its time for new episode of Lance TV Im a little late to the game coz Im gonna do a Sucker punch review and I feel like everyone in the world has already seen and reviewed Sucker Punch its like the most reviewed movie of the year so far and lot of the reviews were a lot of fun Ion 9 did a did a big long piece about it that was pretty funny and um Stupid for movies had this really long like really not really long but like really intense rent a about it um and Ill Ill touch Ill touch on a lot of those issues that they raises well but I wanted to give my own two cents I saw last night I knew it was supposed to be really bad but curiosity got the best of me and I I see all those kind of cult movies like this um I just I didnt wanna be left out of the the converstation um it was playing right down the street at the Vista which is my favorite theater here in LA so you know I went to go see it um and it it is just like everybody saying it is bad I dont think its like the worst movie Ive even seen just this year I mean Ive seen a lot of movies this year coz I was doing this week in movies but I would say I I enjoyed Sucker punch like I was more entertained by it than Battle LA which was just a slog and boring and I just try to totally uninteresting and Sucker punch is a failer but like a really ambitious weird the interesting idiosyncratic failure um it is bad but its not bad I think the way most people have been saying its bad its not bad in the way I was expecting it to be bad um it really is not trying to be a dramatic film or an action film like I think most people thats their knock on it is that its not you know conventionally satisfying as like you know with drama that we dont get to know anything about these characters their play isnt interesting their path to freedom is not compelling and its basically telescoped within the first ten minutes of the movie where were sort of told whats gonna happen before it happens um and and all those things are true but I dont think its trying to be that I think its really much more like a musical and I know this is gonna sound silly coz its such a broad goofy mainstream cult kind of movie but it really has more in common with a musical or and opera or even a ballet than a regular narrative film coz like am remains in narrative film is about character development and plot and then spectacle like in third place so its like puts some people in it and youre gonna enjoy spending time with them therere some funny dialogue make them compelling in their relationships compelling and then have a story thats like at five minutes this happens and at ten minutes this happens that like moves forward and has momentum and then you know put in some action or some romance or sex or whatever like to keep people sort of engaged um and thats what traditionl narrative movies do and this movie is really much more like the plot is what little there is and the characters are they are all just place holders its really like like if you went to go see the ballet and its about the spectacles like the story of Swan lake is why people go see Swan lake its the movement and the dancing and the music and the sets and the experience,0,movie of the years of our last night was supposed to be really bad conversation saying it is bad I don't think it's like the worst movie I've even seen a lot of movies I enjoyed. a strong and boring and I just a failure interesting idiosyncratic failure as bad as most people have been saying it really is not trying to be a dramatic or an action I think most people that's there knock on it is it's not conventionally satisfying a path to Freedom is not what's going to happen before it happens but I don't think it's trying to be that I think it's really much more like a music. goofy mainstream music than a regular is a relationships and then have a story that's like at 5 minutes this happened to the 6:50 but like it has momentum to keep people is really much more like the what little there is if you went to go see the ballet and it's about the spectacles like the story Swan Lake is why people and the dancing and the Music Experience,0.671875,

44,QN9ZIUWUXsY.wav,hissing Im back sorry for the long wait I really have no justification for why Ive been gone for so long I mean I havent really seen that many movies since 127 hours but I just I dont know I couldnt master the will power to make a video Im really really sorry but I can promise you Im back for good now you know why because I saw five movies today and the one of them the first one is what Im going to review to xxx you guys right now it is Tron legacy this movie has been hyped up for months and months Disney has been marketing that crap out of this movie I I mean its just its literally been everywhere main draw for me for this movie was just the fact that its set in this like ridiculous world with all these bright beautiful colors and ridiculous action sequences Tron Legacy is this sequel to the 1982 classic Tron and I dont think thats a very good movie but I do think its a very interesting one its a first movie that used like legitimate special effects like um like they use computers like to generate part of the movie and that have not been done before ever and considering the first movie was a massive innovation theres obviously a lot of expectations of this one um you know Disney poured at least 300 million into this movie um a lot of expectations where writing on it so what do I think of Tron Legacy I can tell you that Tron Legacy is not a good movie but I was still ridicilously entertained by it are these two things possible in the same sentanceI I really do think so let me um th just let me explain tron Legacy is a movie where on most counts that I judge movies it kind of fails the performances are nah the script can be horrible its its a bit of a mixed bag coz there were some very bright moments um the direction is a bit its wobbly basically a lot of elements that I could take a movie on its really wobbly but what it lacks in those areas it most definately makes up for just like sheer visual spectacle I mean this movie has the most gorgeous visuals out of any movies since probably Avatar me if not prettier so many moments in this movie that are just framed and lit so perfectly that so that you just go like kind of huh thats really really cool and then take that world that have been set like a crap tunnel of really kinetic really well done action sequences in it and you have Tron Legacy I I cant belive I havent like explained the plot of this movie yet so its set literally inside the computer it it doesnt make much sense I know and basically um theres this kid named Sam flinth um um hes dad was a head of a big coorporation and then he disappeared twenty years ago and for whatever reason Sam um he gets a page telling him to go to an old araade that his dad owned and basically this makes no sense but he ends up in the computer um and there he basically has to fight his way out to survive but then he finds his dad in an also,0,Baxter I really have no justification for why I've been gone for so long I'm 27 hours but I just I don't know I couldn't muster the will power video I'm really really sorry but I can promise you today before you guys right now it is Tron legacy draw for me for this movie was just the fact that it's set in this like ridiculous world with all these beautiful colors in ridiculous action sequences to the 1982 cult classic trods very interesting facts. generate part of the movie that is not been done before ever see a lot of expectations on this a lot of expectations are writing on it so I can tell you that Trump is not a good movie but I was still ridiculously by it is possible the same sentence I I really do think so kind of fails the performances are the script can be horrible right moments. is wobbly basically a lot of elements that I could take a movie on its really wobbly visual spectacle in this movie has the most gorgeous so perfectly that's that's really really cool and then take that world and instead like crap ton is really kinetic really well done action sequences and you have Tron legacy I can't believe I haven't explained the computer a kid named Sam Flynn Corporation in disappeared two years ago. basically this makes no sense but he ends up in the computer and there he basically has to fight his way out to survive,0.54296875,
45,Qr1Ca94K55A.wav,hi this is cheeseburger man from xxxby the review and this is my straightforward review of Drive Angry 3D now this movie is just ridiculous and I I thought it was excellent um stars Nicolas Cage as a man who escapes from hell because he wants to rescue his granddaughter coz she was kidnapped by satanic worshipers and they wanna sacrifize her so they can bring hell on earth now Nicolas Cage runs into Amber Heard character she was a waitress and she kind of becomes an unofficial sidekick of Nicolas Cage in this movie now she was really xxx in it I felt because they needed something hot to look at on the screen for an hour and forty minutes her acting was pretty bad she didnt really do anything for me but the real star that fell out of this movie was William Fichtner character or William Fichtner I should say his character was the accountant of hell and his job was to bring Nicolas Cage back to the other world now Nicolas Cage isnt really known for his acting lately coz hes had a lot of bad movies and his acting wasnt really good in that movie but it made it hysterical and it was just funny with all of these little one liners that he had and whatever so no Im not saying this movie is bad coz its its not its everything I expected it to be Like I said before it had tacky one liners that were just hysterical there was just plenty of blood um there was there was plenty of sex there was plenty drugs and rocknroll whatever you want it it was it was good um one of the big things I was disappointed though was I felt that they couldve done a lot more with 3D I thought I was expecting to see more body parts flying around after they were shot up by shotguns but I mean it just it just didnt happen um there were a lot of gun fights and some really cool gun fights but there were just people getting shad with blood and splatter and I thought it was just gonna be more than that but so I was a little disappointed in that um now I dont really recommend this if you go on a date with some girl um but if youre xxx movie goer like I am I totally recommend seeing this because its just a fun entertaining movie and I think that you will enjoye it,0,this is Cheeseburger stars because it's a sacrifice now she's really only in it I felt because they needed to look at on the screen for an hour and 40 minutes characters. Nicolas Cage is really known for his acts one-liners that he had and whatever so miners that were just hysterical do is just what are the things I was disappointed or was I felt it just didn't happen to fights. I don't really recommend this if you go on dates with some girl I totally recommend a movie,0.5104166865348816,

49,VbQk4H8hgr0.wav,welcome to this weeks movie review on Shrek the third starring Mike Myers Cameron Diaz and Abraham Shrek is already the second film that comes out as a sequel its the third installment of the series and we had Spirderman already and we had a ton of them coming up this summer and this is the one that I can say was definatelly disappointed I love the first Shrek and the second Shrek and I was really hoping that this one be just as good and it just that it hadnt anything new to offer I was really disappointed with that I mean I went in there hoping to see something original and funny like the first two and it offered nothing of the such it wasnt remotly funny there was a few jokes OK yeah make you giggle or something but thats nothing major nothing really that funny or anything original the characters are all the same and not even as good as the first two movies last ye the last Shrek that came out the second one introduces Puss in boots and I loved Puss in boots and he wasnt even that great this time around the donkey and puss in boots rivalry thats going on it just it wasnt as funny the third time around and there was nothing new to offer plain and simply it was dull for me it couldve been so much better I I couldve I saw it being so much better in my head but it just wasnt it disappointed me highly and I was just sort of discouraged after seeing the movie and Im definatelly wish I had my money back um it was a waste of my time and I dont suggest anyone go see it if youre hoping to if you have to have if you have kids and youre forced to go which you probably will if you have kids you know put up with it as a parent but on your own dont go see it its not really that great everyone is split on this one just as they were on Spiderman and just they are with all the other sequels that are coming out an this one I have to agree on the negative side it was not great it wasnt even remotely good I mean theres a few moments yeah that are original and funny and theres a ne an introduction of a new character Justine Timberlakes character already in the film but they didnt even give him that much to do the he had only few minor lines and none of them were really that great I mean stands out in your mind so the addition of this character was pretty pointless I mean its pleasent to the story but I still find it pointless in the end of the movie and the characters just werent the same as the first two that I fell in love with them it just kind of made me wanna really walk out of the theater to add to the problems I had a problem with the audio in my theater so that just pissed me off more but really I couldve shouldve just walked up and left at that moment it was boring and not at all original in my opinion it couldve been so much better than the second sequel was really great and I loved it and this one just was a flat of disappointments so Im gonna rate this one two stars it shouldve really be one but Im gonna give it a two to be fair because the movie did have some points when I was laughing but very few and it wasnt worth it in my opinion to go see it so I definatelly suggest,0,is already the third installment of the series and I was really hoping something original and funny like the first offered nothing of the original the characters are all the same and he wasn't even a donkey and Puss in Boots on it just it wasn't as funny and there was nothing. it could have been so much better I'd say it's being someone better in my head but it just wasn't disappointed and discouraged after seeing that movie and it was a waste of my time and don't suggest anyone. and you're forced to go with you probably will if you have kids you know what up with it as a parent but on your own don't go see it's not really that great everyone is split on this one just as they were with Spider-Man and just as they are with all the other and it was not great it wasn't even remotely good and there's a new character stands out in your mind so division of his character is pretty pointless I mean. it could have been so much better than the second evil was really great and I loved it should really be one because the movie did have some points were I was laughing but it wasn't worth it in my opinion to go see so,0.5377603769302368,

61,c5xsKMxpXnc.wav,Im here to review Adjustment Bureau and I thought this movie was gonna be really good because matt damon was in it and I was really disappointed so this movies about david norris played by matt damon and what happens is that he is going to run for new york senator and he just cant win because he keeps on making mistakes a lot of mistakes involve stuff that just makes him look bad in the public eye pictures and stuff that he did where the people were like we cant have this guy cause hes not mature enough so now hes preparing his losing speech and he sees a girl in the bathroom and they instantly kiss I dont know they have like they talk for like five minutes and instantly kiss which is dumb but uh she runs away because these cops are chasing her because she crashed a wedding so the next day the adjustment bureau comes in these people that are supposed to change things so that people can have their own fate and the world will be alright now what happens is that matt damon is supposed to spill coffee on himself at exactly 705 but the Adjustment Bureau guy falls asleep and chuckling yeah he forgets to make him spill coffee on himself so he catches the bus and guess who he sees emily blunt so the adjustment bureau is pissed off because the guy that was supposed to make him spill the coffee and make him miss the bus messed up and now he actually knows her and gets her number and everything and theyre not supposed to meet theyre not supposed to fall in love its not part of the plan so matt damon goes to work you know sees his office and everything and sees everybody doesnt even realize that theyre not moving but yea when he opens the door to his boss office he sees that these people are like adjusting his life and hes wondering what the hell is going on and you know they tell him they adjust peoples lives and that they might have to erase his mind completely unless he stays away from the girl and doesnt tell anybody about the plan so matt damon of course does not listen and he still wants to be with the girl so he goes against the adjustment bureau but they keep on changing things on him so it makes it hard for him to be with her so pretty the whole story is about fate des versus free will and which one is more important what i liked about this movie was the concept was cool theres this people t you cant do anything because they are controlling your life pretty much like who you love and all this but they did not execute it very well and they left a lot of plot holes this movie is terrible for these reasons and im gonna tell you why number one because the love is forced you dont feel that these two people love each other and it is very rushed i mean you dont see why these two people love each other theres no character development really with these two like they have their own separate character development but none where these two should be together theres no reason why they should be together you dont see why they should like each other cause they dont show it in the movie i mean the the way they show it is like they ta,0,I was really disappointed so David Norris play buy it Matt Damon is going to run for New York just can't win because he keeps on making mistakes. That just makes him look bad in the public eye pictures and stuff that he did before life we can't have this guy because he's not mature enough so now he's preparing his losing speech and he instantly kiss I don't know his dump because they wedding. Just would be all comes in these people that are supposed to change things so that people can have their own face and the world will be alright Al happens is that message is supposed to spill coffee. 2705 chesham Bureau is pissed off because the guy I was supposed to make us feel the coffee and make him miss the bus messed up and I fall in love it's not part of the plant or like a trusting his life of course does not listen. so pretty much the whole story is about us Free Will and which one is more important sorry well and they left a lot of plot holes this movie is terrible for these reasons and I'm going to tell you why number one but the longest forced you don't feel that these two people love each other and it is very rushed you don't see why these two people love each other there is no character development really where these two should be together there's no reason why they should be together you don't see why this because,0.6614583134651184,

70,f9O3YtZ2VfI.wav,good evening friends this video was originally supposed to be Alfred Hitchcok Psycho versus the Curious case of Benjamin Button but I decided to do away of that crap so its just gonna be a review of Benjamin Button and the Curious Case of Benjamin Button what whatever the name is too long the curious case of Benjamin Button is a David Finchers film starring Brad Pitt as a man who was born old and grows progresivly younger as he grows older its a very interesting idea and its they looked like it had a good core but hm it just too many problems with it the first problem is that its all told in flashback from a point just before Katrina hits New Orleans I didnt need any of that crap I dont need it all told in flashback I dont need the added element of Katrina it dosent it just its too much crap in here the the movies is too long they just need to cut that out another thing is we dont need his entire life th we do not need the entire span birth to death just give me a nice interesting choke and scale it down on like two hours this also falls in to the trandy is very popular these days if you do a whole all of CGI um and if youre gonna do mostly CGI just make an animated movie this looks like it just has a polyurethane coating on it makes him look too too good but dont get me wrong its not all bad its got my two favorite acresses in it Tilda Swinton and Cate Blanchett like I said before Is a very interesting idea and they did a lot of good things with it but its its like someone made you a kick ass sandwich but they put mayonnaise on it and you dont like mayonnaise and its not like tomato or lettuce where you can pick it off no its got it mayonnaise in its all over everything and now youre stuck with this kick ass sandwich that would be kick ass if it didnt have mayonnaise on it but it has mayonnaise on it or you go make another sandwich go make another sandwich this movie is just not quite good enough I really liked David Finch I liked all the um I like the cast but and its a good story but clap huh its a pass my neighbor probably thinks Im crazy yelling about movies to a camera,0,good evening friends this video was originally supposed to be Alfred Hitchcock Psycho versus The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. who decided to do away with that crap so Benjamin Button Brad Pitt as a man as he grows older. it's just too many problems with it the first problem is that it's all told in flashback from just before Katrina hit New Orleans I don't need it all told in flashback I don't need the added element of Katrina it doesn't it's too much crap in here that the movies too long and just need to cut that out another thing is. the entire span of birth to death. just give me a nice interesting truck scale down my two hours this also falls into the trend it is very popular these days make an animated movie looks like a polyurethane coating on it. makes it look too too good. I don't get me wrong it's not all bad just got to my favorite actresses in it like I said before is a very interesting idea good things with it but it's like someone made you a kick ass sandwich but they put mayonnaise on it and you don't like mayonnaise it's all over everything and now you're stuck with this kick ass sandwich that would be kick ass. another sandwich. go make another sandwich. movies just not quite good enough. I really like David Fincher I like all the I like the cash but. and it's a good story but. it's a pass my neighbor probably thinks I'm crazy the only about movies to a camera,0.6328125,
71,f_pcplsH_V0.wav,I just want you all to know that just do we dont have to delay this review until Saturday i drove an hour each way to catch a midnight showing of this movie so you better appreciate this review i know the majority of the people who watch my reviews arent actually my subscribers but to any of you who are i expect a thumbs up got it but anyway lets start with the obvious who the killer was or killers theyre back to you having two killers thankfully because it does make a lot more sense having the killer be able to be everywhere if theres two of them okay first off here were the two guys in the trailer who were laying out the rules the assistant killer basically was the one with the long hair not the one with the camera hes killed and the main killer was Sidneys cousin Jill who was tired of living in Sidneys shadow and has decided to stage a remake of the original movie in which she can take Sidneys place at the end and so her basic goal is reenact the original movie only upping the ante on every single scene exactly as modern remakes do hmph my overall opinion of the results of this process are its better than Scream 3 and actually is better than Scream 2 a lot of people dont like scream 2 i think its highly underrated i hated Scream 3 but i think this one did beat Scream 2 Now i didnt really like the first hour that much though im sure you all remember the stab movies that were based on the scream movies or the experiences of Sidney in universe so that people could comment on the killers reenacting the movies or following up the movies well in the first hour those become way way way too much of a plot point basically theres now seven of them the fifth one apparently features time travel i think xxx i want to see it but anyway but it actually basically makes the characters congition not just of the genre within which they are in but of their own franchise to a ridiculous extent Im just kinda like no this is going to far there are only 3 scream movies,0,"I just want you all to know that just when we have to display this review until Saturday I drove an hour each way to catch a midnight showing of this movie. so you better appreciate this review. enjoy, water views are actually my subscribers. but bring it here or I expect a thumbs-up got it. what's up with the obvious who the killer was or Killers their back to. you having two killers thankfully because it does make more sense having kill or be able to be everywhere if there's two of them. the two guys in the trailer who were laying out the rules. assistant killer basically was. the camera he's killed. and the main killer was Sydney's cousin Jill who is tired of living in. Sydney Shadow and decided to Stage a remake of the original movie in which she can take Cindy's place at the end. and so the basic goal is we are at the original movie only upping the ante on every single scene exactly as modern remix do. play Firework Canyon of the results of this process or. it's better than screen 3 and actually better than screen to I think it's highly underrated I hate Scream 3 but I think this would be a beat Scream 2. Pele Pele the first hour that much though. I'm sure you all remember the stab movies. that were based on the screen moving birthday. In the city in universe. so that people could comment on. the Killer's real acting the movies or falling up the movies. well in the first hour goes to come way way way too much of a plot Point basically. there is a seven of them. benefits and features time travel like that movie I want to see it but anyway. actually they can make the characters cognition not just of the genre within which they are in that has their own franchise to a ridiculous extent. I'll just kind of like. now this is going too far they're only 3 Scream movies",0.6536458134651184,
72,fvVhgmXxadc.wav,Hi Im Michael and Im Michael the movie man Today were reviewing Sucker punch this is the new film by Zack Snyder the director of Three hundred and the Watchman and this is Snyders first film thats not based on preexisting work Now getting to set up of Sucker punch which Ill get to in a minute it only had the potential to be a film that was both provking and action packed but unfortunately its just an ugly wild violent unvolving and sadistic exercise that I got very little joy out of in fact I got mostly pain out of it the story invoves young girl played by Emily Browning and after her mother dies she and her sister are sent to live with their evil stepfather after going through tons of abuse thats pretty heavily inferred in the opening sequence the young girl besides to try to escape but she ends up killing her sister by accident and than shes insitutionalized with her stepfather and is set up to have a lobotomy thankfully shes shes saved from the lobotomty by the head nurse and shes sent to work at the night club thats run by this other sadistic man named Boyo and where the girl who gets the nickmname babydoll when she gets there is forced to not only be trapped in the vocation that she obviously doesnt wanna be in but she also has to dance and satisfy some horny man that come in now it also takes so really creepy xxxof the fact that Emily Browning in this movie looks like shes underage even though I know for su for a fact that shes not underage in real life and movie itself says shes twenty but I dont know Ill get to that in a little bit anyway Babydolls than forced to dance for the first time by by the order of the dance instructor there the dance coordinator whos played by Carla Gugino and when she dances she goes into this alternate world that kind of looks like video game in a certain way in fact the first time she goes in it looks like a Japanese temple and later time she goes like a World War II battlefield um castle this kind of pulled out of Lord of the Rings anyway the first time she goes in she meets this prophet whos played by Scott Glenn and he tells her that she can escape from the world shes in by collecting a group of items and than one other itam that is shell gonna have to find out for herself what that is throat cleaning anyway so she gets the idea that hey we can escape and she tries to get the other girls who are dancing at the night club to and also trapped there to join in and shes able to and basically the rest of the movie is them going into or going back into babydolls dream worlds to try and collect all these items even though they are actually collecting the items within the real world and actually theres a lot of things going on as far as whats in Babydolls mind whats in her mind within her mind in a way its kind of like inception in that way its kind of playing with the idea whats real whats not what the Matrix films did although actually the best comparison this is this film would actually be something like Pans Labyrinth,0,hi Michael. Michael the movie Man and damaging Sucker Punch this is a new film by Zack Snyder the director of 300 in the Watchmen film is not the case in the cage with the work to set up a second front in a minute and action-packed but unfortunately it's just an ugly loud violence involving and sadistic exercise I got very little joy out of it. They got most of pain out of its the story involves a young girl played by Emily Browning and after her mother dies she evil stepfather. after going through tons of abuse it's pretty heavily inferred in the opening sequence the young girl decides to try and Escape but she ends up killing a sister by accident and then she was institutionalized for The Stepfather and it set up to have Ottomans by the head nurse and she said to work at a nightclub it's run by a snuggle suggested Man Named Blue and where the girl who gets the nickname baby doll when she gets there it's for us to not only be trapped in a location that can stop you can want to see if you can come in. now it'll take care of really creepy on me when you get to the fact that Emily Browning looks like she's not but I don't know I'll get to that in a little bit. baby dolls been forced to Dance For the First Time by by the order of the coordinator who played by Carla Gugino and world is like a video game it looks like a Japanese Temple and later time she goes like a World War 2 Battlefield Castle just pulled out of the Rings the first time she goes in profits is played by Scott Glenn and he tells her that she can escape from the world she's in by collecting a group of items and then one other item find out for yourself. anyway so she gets the idea that pay we can escape and she tries to get the other girls who are dancing at the nightclub and also trapped there to join in and she's able to and basically rest of the movie is them going into I'm going back into baby dolls dream world to try and collect all these items even though they're actually collecting the items within the real world or Leslie there's a lot of things going on as far as what's in baby dolls Minds What's in her mind within her mind in a way it's kind of like Inception in that way it's kind of playing with the idea of what's real what's not but the Matrix films did the best comparison for this film actually would be something like Pan's Labyrinth,0.7291666269302368,

78,nzpVDcQ0ywM.wav,this movie is directed by steven summers whose claim to fame is the mummy franchise and he really seems to be channeling michael bay in this movie the plot has the consistency of swiss cheese and its really glossed over with lots of stunning special effects and big explosions sigh all in all its kind of a disappointment to any of us who grew up in the 80s and are used to the toys in the cartoon i feel like it almost should have had a g rating it was really kind of dumb down for us and i hate to say that i think you will really LOVE this movie if you are 8 but if you are a child who grew up in that time period youre not going to enjoy this movie very much because they arent playing to you theyre playing to a new audience of kids who dont know anything about these characters in the first place the plot involves some tiny little machines sometime in the future that can destroy cancer cells and have become weaponized and bad people are trying to steal the warheads and so a government secret group called gi Joe is trying to protect them from the bad guys channing tatum is the lead he starrs as duke hes from the step up movies i guess which i havent seen and all i can is hes a pretty average guy i dont really feel any emotional pull from him in this movie even a scene where he proposes to his girlfriend in a flashback he barely bats an eye his best friend is played by marlon mayans he plays rip cord marlon wayans kind of plays a watered down version of himself from other movies he does some stereotypical things like talking uh about busting a cap while flying an airplane but otherwise hes just there to be the best friend and hes pretty average too the two women in this movie are particularly good looking and they kick a lot of butt uh sienna miller and rachel nickols one on each side there and they kick each others butt they kick other peoples butt and so thats pretty entertaining this is a really big movie for their careers because i havent really seen them in a lot of big movies other notable mentions dennis quaid plays hawk leader of the gi joes and his performance is campy and comes off as an army cheerleader some of the time laughing jonathan price is the president he is average brendan frasier shows up in a cameo for a training montage and its sh so short lived he barely needs to even be there uh stormshadow is very cool his fight sequences are very neat and he delivers a lot of intensity snake eyes you never see his face but it turns out he is played by the guy who played toad in the first xmen movie and he also kicks a lot of butt he never gives up the villain,0,directed by Stephen Sommers whose claim to fame is the mummy franchise and he really seems to be channeling Michael Bay in this movie The Plot has the consistency of a crossover with massive spending special effects and big explosions to any of us who are used to the toys in the cartoon I feel like it was really kind of. come down for us and I hate to say that I think you will really love this movie if you are eight. but if you were a child who grew up in that time. You're not going to enjoy this movie very much because they aren't playing to you playing to a new audience of kids who don't know anything about these characters in the first place the plot involves some tiny little machines sometime in the future that can destroy cancer cells and had become a warhead and so a government secret group called g.i. Joe is trying to protect them from the fat guys is the lead he stars as duke he's from the Step Up movies I guess which I haven't seen all I can say is he's a pretty average guy I don't really feel any emotion and this movie even a scene where he proposes to his girlfriend and a flashback he is played by Marlon Wayans he plays Rip Torn. place a watered-down version of himself from other movies he does some stereotypical things like talking about busting a cat while flying an airplane but otherwise he's just there to be the best friend and he's pretty average to the two women in this movie particularly good-looking and they take a lot of but Sienna Miller and Rachel Nichols one on each side there and stay kick each others but the other people's but it's pretty entertaining this is a really big movie for their careers because I haven't really seen them in a lot of big movies other notable mentions Dennis Quaid plays Hawks leader of the GI Joes and his performance is campy and comes off as an army cheerleader some of the time is the president's he is average Brendan Fraser shows up in a cameo for a training montage and it's so so short-lived early needs to even be there. Storm Shadow is very cool his fight sequences are pretty neat and he delivers a lot of intensity because you never see his face but it turns out he is played by the guy who played toad first X-Men movie and he also takes a lot of you never gives up the villa,0.6901041269302368,

I guess the only other problem I had was it was. that. the jokes are really cheesy I don't like cheesy jokes but she's jokes her most times funny because they're really bad so if that's the case then you can see this movie if you really like cheesy jokes for Victorville movies but other than that it was a perfect family movie I would definitely take. eight or younger kids to the movie of definite family movie. see on Stage Department I have at the movie theater is. they were kids crying the whole time. Ann's. baby crying getting your nerves ever. would recommend going to this movie because since my kids. it must you control really late showing cuz I don't think it's going to be outside for you but that's the only other problem I have is the other than that was a good movie cute you know a great job bringing Smurfs 2 light switches show George Lopez Neil Patrick Harris Katy Perry and so forth. it was a great movie and I loved it but I had a few problems so it doesn't love it as liked it. three stars for Smurfs and. space mercenary one,0.7395833134651184,
80,pLTX3ipuDJI.wav,what can I say about the Predators movie I guess thats exactly you would expect from the movie in this genre a group of people the bad guys discover as to what the bad guys are and in the big long thing is who lives and who dies nothing new is brought in those Predator series no surprises no big twist no finish I like to tease some mystery and great plot what couldve been but than all is explained and disppeares ten minutes later its just a clear remake of Predator from back in 1997 with the premise being almost identical althought what wasnt the same was the connection to each other which first movie had and this one not in the first run they were a team and they worked together and you see the personalites this movie just pops a group of different killers down together and lets them interact poorly you dont see any of the personalities when one dies you dont mourn over tham an you dont get an attachment to anybody of the acting nothing stands out a spectacular which is to be expected of the movie like this but nothing sucks either which gains the movie some points I guess the film is xxx cast though with the Im trying to be bad ass Brody as a selfelected leader a doctor played by Topher Grace and a short camio in the way of Laurence Fishburne what disappointed me was that one of the most hyped actors in the movie was only in there for short amount of time and I know you cant hype a movie with an unknown actors so even if someone is in there for a few minutes you should hype them but its just a little weak overall for me than we were looking forward to him and he was gone quickly although what it did do was interesting but i but it didnt make sense he co Laurence Fishburne comes in and tells the characters things that only screen writers shouldve known about which gives a little more of f fony feel this whole thing just like one of the girls tells the exact story of the first movie its a pointless scene for the audience and the characters it dosent give an give any insight or help its just make them seem like she sa she saw the first movie in finale I would only recommend this movie for a rental non in theater because its a low grade sequal to the 87th version and only if you like the series,0,what can I say about the Predator movie nothing new was brought in the series is a clear remake a predator from back in 1987 with each other if you want to work together and you see the personalities. the group of different killer down together poorly you don't see nothing sounds out a spectacular which is to be expected of a movie like this either stuff like a leader can type of movie with someone isn't it for a few minutes he just hates them. throwing 42mm. he comes in and tells the characteristics of any insight for Health it just makes him seem like she's a movie 87 version,0.5364583134651184,

82,rnaNMUZpvvg.wav,the verdict is stupid and a complete waste of money not mine I mean sort of mine but it was a fun experience going like I didnt expect it to be good but its just such a waste of money for them like when I see the movie thats obviously had a very big budget and it is like not even good it makes me angry coz Im just like why are you wasting so much money aaaaa it wasnt even holding my attention I could barely stay awake through the movie I honestly wanted the aliens to win and Im gonna talk spoilers now all the characters were just so unlikable just there was only one character the doctor he was the only person I even really cared about and even he was a douchebag all of them every single cowboy was just a complete douchebag and there was just this little boy and he was the only person who wasnt a douchebag but he wasnt even interesting his mom was dead and his dad hadnt seen him a year so like I really like supposed to feel a little bad for him or something but they gave him no no character like he had no character development whatsoever he was just like a plot device for this other guy to start acting like a father figure and he was just stupid but then he didnt even act like a father figure towards him he was just like oh I shall be your father figure but then I realize I should be a father to my own son goodbye child and Harrison Ford from the trailers for some reason I got the idea that he was a sheriff but he was actually complete douchebag who just ran the town with his business Daniel Craigs character so he had like amnesia right like an am someone who has amnesia like usually theyre like really confused just like you know vulnerable and this guy was like the complete opposite he didnt know what was going on so he just killed everyone he met like I dont know whats going on Im confused so Im just gonna kill you all why are you killing everyone it just some people were like oh hes so cool hes so awesome like youve never seen that in the movie this person who had amnesia just kills everybody even if its like but that was so unnecessary whay are you killing these people you dont even know whats going on like dude get over yourself he looked awesome while he did it but yeah OK so let all the girls who want all disagree with me coz they all think this is an amazing movie but they all think he was amazing because they were staring at Daniel Craig the whole time theyr going oh my gosh hes so hot all the guys that went were pretty much on my page they were just like wow that was stupid wow so I sat with the guys the girls set up higher than I did I sat with the guys and we all try to stay awake through it um and kept falling asleep and then talk about how stupid it was it was Cowboys and aliens but theres a reason they didnt call it cowboys versus aliens coz the cowboys and the aliens they dont they barely even fight at all coz thay cant like the cowboys s stand no chance all it is is like Daniel Craigs character has this thing that can blow them up oh goody for him then they get Indians involved and the Indians the ca,0,the verdict is not mine I mean sort of mine but it was a fun experience going like I can expect it to be good but it's just a waste of money for them like when I seen you had a very big budget and it's like not even why are you wasting so much money which is so unlikeable there is only one character that was just a complete douchebag and he was the only person who wasn't his mom was dead and his dad hadn't seen him in a year. so like I said you're like supposed to feel start Harrison Ford trailers for some reason I like usually they're like really confused and like. you know this guy was like I don't know what's going on killing everyone in the movie this person who had them you just killed everybody. that was so unnecessary why are you girls who weren't stressed out with the guys the girls set up higher than I did and I saw the guys and we all try to stay awake through it and they didn't call Cowboys versus Aliens the Cowboys and Indians,0.6471353769302368,

87,vvZ4IcEtiZc.wav,hello youre watching watch this fucking movie my name is jen and i will be reviewing blue valentine for you today so i saw blue valentine in theatres a while back and i really really loved it and i thought that the performances in it were incredible and i was just thinking about um how its the performances in it were sort of over overlooked at the academy awards because um there were so many great movies that came out this year i mean um the kings speech black swan 127 hours inception and uh if im missing any im sorry um theyre just off the top of my head but there were a lot of great movies out this year some of the great performances um of last year were kind of overlooked cuz there were just so many of them and i think that blue valentine has um become kind of underrated so blue valentine is about a married couple on the verge of uh you know a collapse they are they used to be in love they were in love and they have a child together but um as you see from the beginning of the movie everything just seems to be falling apart like they dont seem to be connecting anymore um theres no communication between the two of them so the husband played by ryan gosling um decides to take his wife whos pl played by michelle williams uh they go up to some kind of sleazy hotel to as like a last ditch attempt to finally connect again as they used to when they were younger and as this movie uh progresses you co you sort of see these flashbacks of uh when they were first met and the kind of love that uh that was between them at the at the initial stages of their relationship and its truly heartbreaking to see that contrasted with the state of things uh in the present when you see them you know they they almost hate each other and you see the husband trying to reach out to his wife but the wife um it seems like she cant even stand him she cant really stand being around him and she um doesnt respect him and smacking lips all sorts of things and theres a lots of smacking lips theres so many dynamics going on with this relationship and i think that it was it was a great story so uh blue valentine what did i think of it it was after i got out of the theatre I sort of thought to myself wow ive seen so many movies about broken relationships about couples that are on the verge of divorce and its sort of like a contrived plot thats been used over and over again because its um its an audience pleaser you know an especially when it comes to romantic dramas like thumping its uh it gets the audiences to theatres because its a compelling idea but its been uh done,0,hello you're watching once it's fucking and I will be reviewing Blue Valentine for you today so I saw a Blue Valentine in Cedars a while back and I really really love it and I saw a Funnel Vision at were incredible as you thinking about how is the performances in it we're sort of old overlooked at the Academy Awards because there were so many great movies that came out this year I mean the Kings off the top of my head but there were a lot of great movies out this year some of the Great Performances of last year we're kind of overlooked cuz there's just so many of them and I think that has become kind of underrated so. Blue Valentine is about a married couple on the verge of collapse as you see from the beginning of everything seems to be falling apart like a husband play by Ryan Gosling decides to take his wife who is played by Michelle Williams and they go up to some kind of sleazy hotel to as a last-ditch attempt to finally connect again as they used to when they're younger and as this movie progresses you sort of see these flashbacks of when they first met and kind of love.. between them at the initial stages of their relationship and it's truly heartbreaking to see that contrasted with the state of things in the present when you see them standing around and then she doesn't respect him and all sorts of things and there's a lot of it was a great story Blue Valentine would I think of it it would seem so many movies about. broken relationships about couples that are on the verge of divorce and it's sort of like a contrived plot that's been used over and over again because it's it's an audience please do you know especially when it comes to romantic dramas like its it gets the audiences to theatres because it's a compelling idea but it's,0.7239583730697632,
88,vyB00TXsimI.wav,I appologize that I have been kind of neglecting movie reviews lately because things have been really really busy but I do wanna tell you about Priest Priest stars Paul Bettany Its based on a graphic novel and it is crazy basically priests are trained to kill vampires and they are super awesome they basically have super human abilities when it comes down to it if you were looking for a movie that has anything realistic in it you should not be looking at this movie because it is insane if you like explosions really ridiculous action sequences malodramatic plot and acting this is the right movie to see the premise is that Paul Bettanys character is contacted about the kidnapping of a young girl from a Wasteland community and he has a connection to this girl through family and he wants to get her back because he knows shes been kidnapped by vampires even though the church who is like big brother within the cities will not allow it and theyre denying the vampires continue to exist so off he goes breaks bonds with church goes out in search of the girl Maggy Cue is a priest and shes sent out after him and she also has pretty sweet moves and is fun to watch some really fun touches within the movie is that two vampires in other shows appear in this movie not as vampires one of them is Steven Moyer who you know as vampire Bill from True blood he plays the father of the kidnapped girl young fellow that plays sheriff Hicks was the vampire that kidnapped Bella in the first Twilight movie and he is helping look for the kidnapped girl as well therere also two Lord of the rings grads which I absolutely love and anyone who knows me knows the Lord of the rings trilogy is probably my favorite movie ever if all three of them were put together yeah thats about how my favorite list goes but Carl Urban plays Black hat Black hat is a former priest and Brad Durraff who was Wormtongue in the Lord of the rings serie plays salesman which basically means hes Wormtongue again in a different way other notable mentiones are Christopher Plumber plays the monk senior whos like the head of the church and Lily Collins plays Lucy the kidnapped girl and she is a really pretty girl the last time we saw her was probably in the blind side this is one of my favorite types of movies I really love the melodramatic over the top crazy action sort of thing going on theres s scene in a cave where they fight a giant monster that really reminds me of like some sort of Lord of the Rings mines of moria moment and theres a better on top of the train fights than the first mission impossible movie so yes I really enjoyed it I thought it was fun and I enjoyed myself a lot at the movie I laughed at quite a bit of the dialogue and there actually was one

Joe. miss this movie that came out in theaters because I really want to see it actually but I never DVD rented it and first of all I was never a used figures I want the TV show every once in awhile but I wasn't on it. that being said I still have got a lot of this week he's going to have some spoilers and so if you have you know yourself with that video going back to GI Joe Rise of the Cobra this movie is incredibly cheesy cheesy and this is the good kind of cheesy. I did like Transformers to this movie. I got this movie stars Channing Tatum actually a lot of this is a cheesy tuna like something like to write home about just having fun with her performance in particular I cannot pronounce his name the guy from lost a lot of fun to Santa Cruz for Appleton. he does a great job is snake eyes it's always cool to see that one thing off the lights about the GI Joe movies House International,0.6015625,
