0,AJJacobs_2007P.sph.wav,i've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave so it's about choosing the parts of the bible about compassion about tolerance about loving your neighbor as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin or intolerance or violence which are very much in the bible as well so if we are to find any meaning in this book then we have to really engage it and wrestle with it and i thought i'd end with just a couple more there's me reading the bible that's how i hailed taxi cabs morning but it served well for a day so anyway thank you so much for letting me so and it was about the year i spent reading the encyclopedia britannica from a to z in my quest to learn everything in the world or more precisely from which is a type of east asian music all the way to zwyiec which is well i don't although listening to kevin kelly you don't have to remember anything you can just google it so i wasted some time there i love those experiments but i think that the most profound and life changing experiment that i've done is my most recent experiment i thought i'd tell you a little about what i like to write and i like to immerse myself in my topics i just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig and where i spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the bible the year of living biblically and i undertook this for two reasons the first was that i grew up with no religion at all as i say in my book i'm jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian so but i've become increasingly interested in religion i do think it's the defining issue of our time or one of the main ones and i have a son i want to know what to teach him so i decided to dive in head first and try to live the bible the second reason i undertook this is because i'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism religious fundamentalism and people who say what if you really did take the bible literally i decided to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the bible literally without picking and choosing the first thing i did was i got a stack of bibles i had christian bibles i had jewish bibles a friend of mine sent me something called a hip hop bible where the twenty three rd psalm is rendered as the lord is all that as opposed to what i knew it as the lord is my shepherd then i went down and i read several versions and i wrote down every single law that i could find and this was a very long list over seven hundred rules and they range from the famous ones that i had heard of the ten commandments love your neighbor be fruitful and multiply so i wanted to follow those and actually i take my projects very seriously because i had twins during my year so i definitely take my projects seriously but i also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the bible there is the law in leviticus you cannot shave the corners of your beard i didn't know where my corners were so i decided to let the whole thing grow and this is what i looked like by the end as you can imagine i spent a lot of time at airport security my wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months so certainly the challenge was there the bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers so i thought sounds strange but i'll try it you only know i see my life as a series of experiments so i work for esquire magazine and a couple of years ago i wrote an article called my outsourced life i got rid of all my poly cotton t shirts the bible says that if two men are in a fight and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other her hand shall be cut off so i wanted to follow that rule wife was standing nearby looking like she had a strong grip so there's another shot of my beard i will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing and incredibly challenging and there were two types of laws were particularly challenging the first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day know i could spend a year not killing but spending a year not gossiping not coveting not lying you know i live in new york and i work as a journalist so this was seventy five eighty percent of my but it was really interesting because i was able to make some progress because i couldn't believe how my behavior changed my thoughts this was one of the huge lessons of the year is that i almost pretended to be a better person and i became a little bit of a better person so i had always thought you know you change your mind and you change your behavior but it's often the other way round you change your behavior and you change your mind so you know if you want to become more compassionate you visit sick people in the hospital and you will become more compassionate where i hired a team of people in bangalore india to live my life for me so they answered my emails they answered my phone they argued with my wife for me and they you donate money to a cause and you become emotionally involved in that cause so it really was cognitive psychology that if you smile you will become happier which as we know is actually true the second type of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty one st century america and the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers but it's a big part of the bible so i had to address i was able to stone one adulterer it happened i was in the park and i was dressed in my biblical clothing sandals and a white robe you know because again the outer see how dressing biblically affected my mind up to me and he said why are you dressed like that and i explained my project and he said well i am an adulterer are you going to stone me and i said well that would be great and i took out a handful of stones from my pocket that i had been carrying around for weeks hoping for just this interaction and you know they were pebbles out of my hand he was actually an elderly man mid seventies just so you know but he 's still an adulterer and still quite angry he grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face and i felt that i could eye for an eye i could retaliate and throw one back at him so that was my experience stoning and it did allow me to talk about in a more serious way these big issues how can the bible be so barbaric in some places and yet so incredibly wise in others it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years and it's sort of evolved it's not a book that was written and came down from on high my son bedtime stories it was the best month of my life because i just sat back and i read books and watched movies so i thought i would end by telling you just a couple of the take away the bigger lessons that i learned from my year the first is thou shalt not take the bible literally this very very clear early on because if you do then you end up acting like a crazy person and stoning adulterers or here well that's another i did spend some time shepherding it's a very relaxing vocation i recommend it but this one is and my wife thought this was very offensive so she sat in every seat in our apartment and i had to spend much of the year standing until i bought my own seat and carried it around so you know i met with creationists i went to the creationists museum and these are the ultimate literalists and it was fascinating because they were not stupid people at all that they distort all the data to fit their model and they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this and i will say though was a wonderful experience more recently i wrote an article for esquire called about radical honesty and this is a movement the museum is gorgeous they really did a fantastic job if you're ever in kentucky there's i think it's crazy they did a great job another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks and this one was a big lesson because i was praying giving these prayers of thanksgiving which was odd for an agnostic but saying thanks all the time every day and i started to change my perspective and i started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day that i didn't even notice that i took for granted as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong so this is actually a key to happiness for me is to just remember when i came over here the car didn't flip over and i didn't trip coming up the stairs it's a remarkable thing this one was unexpected because i started the year as an agnostic and by the end of the year i became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic which i love a movement so if anyone wants to join the basic idea is whether or not there is a god there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness and that our rituals can be sacred the sabbath can be this was one of the great things about my year doing the sabbath because i am a workaholic so having this one day where you cannot work it really that changed my life this is started by a psychologist in virginia who says that you should never ever lie except maybe during poker and golf his only exceptions and more than that journey i wanted it to be about religion in america so i spent time with evangelical christians and hasidic jews and the i'm very proud because i think i'm the only person in america to out bible talk a jehovah 's witness thank you but it was because i had some very preconceived notions about for instance evangelical christianity and i found that it's such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it there's a group i met with called the red letter christians and they focus on words in the bible which are the ones that jesus spoke that's how they printed them in the old bibles and is that jesus never talked about homosexuality they have a pamphlet that says here 's what jesus said about homosexuality and you open it up and there's nothing in it so they say jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts helping poor people so this was very inspiring to me i recommend jim wallace and tony campolo they're very inspiring leaders even though i disagree with much of what they say also thou shalt not i was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces and the thing is if they're not harmful they're not to be completely dismissed because i learned that i was thinking i was doing all these rituals these biblical rituals separating my and linen and i would ask these religious people why would the bible possibly tell us to do this why would god care and they said we don't know but it's just rituals that give us meaning and i would say but that's crazy and they would say well what about you you blow out candles on top of a birthday cake if a guy from mars came down and saw here 's one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics would the martians say well that he makes sense but that guy 's crazy so no i think that are not harmful but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed and finally i learned that thou shall pick and choose and this one i learned because i tried to follow everything in the bible and i failed miserably because you can 't you have to pick and choose and anyone who follows the bible is going to be picking and choosing the key is i do not recommend this at all to give you a sense of the experience the article was called i think you're fat to pick and choose the right parts there's the phrase called my argument is what 's wrong with cafeterias i've had some great meals at cafeterias,1,I thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write and I like to immerse myself in my topics I just like to Dive Right In and become a sort of a human guinea pig and I seen my life is a series of experiments so I work for Esquire magazine a couple of years ago I wrote an article called my outsourced life where I hired a team of people in Bangalore India to live my life for me so they answered my emails answered my phone they argued with my wife for me and they they read my son bedtime stories is the best month of my life cuz I just sat back and I read books and watched movies was a wonderful experience more recently I wrote an article for Esquire called a rat about radical honesty and this is a movement where. decided by psychologist in Virginia who says that you should never ever lie except maybe during poker and golf this is only exception and more than that whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth so I decided I would try this for a month this was the worst month of my life. I do not recommend this at all to give you a sense of the experience the article was called I think you're fat so. Alice are my most recent book was my previous book was called the know-it-all and it was about the year I spent reading the encyclopaedia Britannica from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world or more precisely from a tack which is a type of East Asian music all the way to exhibit which is why I don't want to ruin the end it's a very exciting twist ending like a O'Henry novel so I won't ruin it but I love that one because that was an experiment about how much information one Cuban praying for the absorbed although listening to Kevin Kelly you don't have to remember anything you can just Google it so I wasted some time there but I love those experiments but I think that the most profound and life-changing experiment that I've done is my most recent experiments where I spent a year trying to follow all of. rules of the Bible the Year of Living biblically and. I undertook this for two reasons the first was that I grew up with no religion at all as I say and in my book I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian so. not very. but I become increasingly interested in religion I do think it's the defining issue of our time or one of the one of the main one and I have a son I want to know what to teach him so I decided to dive in headfirst and try to live the Bible the second reason I undertook this is because I'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism religious fundamentalism and and people who say they take the Bible literally which is according to some polls as high as forty-five or fifty percent of America so I decided Well what if you really did take the Bible literally I decide to take it to its logical conclusion and and take everything in the Bible literally without picking and choosing the first thing I did was I got a stack of Bibles a Christian Bible say hat Jewish Bibles a friend of mine sent me something called a hip hop Bible where the 23rd psalm is rendered as the Lord is all that as opposed to what I know it as the Lord is my. Shepherd then I went down and I read several versions and I wrote down every single law that I could find in this was a very long list over 700 rules and they range from the famous ones that I had heard of The Ten Commandments love your neighbor be fruitful and multiply so I want to follow those in the actually I take my project very seriously because I had plans during my ear so are you I definitely take my project seriously but I also wanted to follow the hundreds of Arcane an obscure laws that are in the Bible verses the law in Leviticus you can shave the corners of your beard I didn't know where my Corners were so I decided to let the whole thing grow and this is what I look like by the end as you can imagine I spend a lot of time at airport security. my wife won't kiss me for the last 2 months so certainly it sounds like the Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers so I thought sound strength and I'll try and hit you only know if you will try it so I got rid of all my poly cotton t-shirt the Bible says that if two men are in a fight and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man than her hand shall be cut off so I wanted to follow that rule. that one that one I followed by default by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby looking like she had a strong grip so. up there's another shot of honey yes my dear I will think it was an amazing year because it really was life-changing and Incredibly challenging and there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging the first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day you know I could spend a year not feeling but spending a year not gossiping not coveting not lying you know I live in New York and I work as a journalist so this is seventy-five 80% of my day I had to do it but it was really interesting because I was able to to make some progress because I couldn't believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts this is one of the huge lessons of the year is that I almost pretended to be a better person and I became a little bit of a better person so. it's the thought I had always thought you know you change your mind and you change your behavior but it's often the other way around you change your behavior. I need to change your mind so you know if you want to become more compassionate you visit sick people in the hospital and you will become more compassionate you donate money to a cause and you become emotionally involved in that caught it so it really was cognitive psychology you know cognitive dissonance that I was experiencing the Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology very primitive cognitive psychology in the Proverbs that says that if you smile he will become happier which as we know is actually true the second type of a rule that was difficult to obey was the rule if it'll get you into a little trouble in 21st century America and perhaps it's the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers it's a kid that's a big part of the Bible so I figured I had to address it so I was able to Stone one adult her it happened I was in the. and I was dressed in my biblical clothing lets her sandals and then a sort of a white robe in the outer affect the inner and this man came up to me and he said why you dress like that and I explained my project and he said well I'm an adulterer are you going to Stone me and I said well that would be great. and the. I actually. I took out a handful of stones for my pocket that I've been carrying around for weeks hoping for just this interaction and you know they were Pebbles he he grab them out of my hand he was actually an elderly man mid-70s just so you know but he's still an adulterer and still quite angry he grabbed me out of my hand and threw it in my face and I felt that I could have I for an eye I could retaliate and throwing back with him so that was my experience stoning it and it did allow me to talk and talk about in a more serious way these big issues like how can the Bible be so barbaric and some places and yet so incredibly wise and others how should we view the Bible should we view it you know as original intent like a sort of us Scalia version of the Bible how is the Bible written and accidents this is a tech crowd I talked in the book about how the Bible actually. remind me of the Wikipedia because it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years and it's sort of evolve it's not a book that was written and you know came down from on high so I thought I would I would end by telling you just a couple of the the take away the bigger lessons that I learned from my year the first is that I shall not take the Bible literally this was this became very very clear early on because if you do then you end up acting like a crazy person and Stony belters or here's another example of a while after another I I I did spend some time shepherding you know so it's a very relaxing vacation I recommend it but this one is the Bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month and more than that you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat and my wife thought this was very offensive so she sat in every seat. our apartment and I had to spend much of the year standing until I I bought my own seat and then carried around so you know I met with the creationists I went to the creationist Museum and these are the ultimate literally stand and it was fascinating because they were not stupid people at all I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average Evolution it's just that their faith is so strong in this literal interpretation of the Bible that they distort all the data to to fit their model and the and then go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this and I will say though the museum is gorgeous they really did a fantastic job if you're ever in Kentucky there's like you can see a movie of the flood and they have sprinkler is in the ceiling that will sprinkle on you ordering the the flood scene so whatever you think of creationism and I think it's crazy it is they did a great job. another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks and this one was a big lesson because I was praying giving these prayers of Thanksgiving which was on for an agnostic but I'm saying thanks all the time everyday and I've started to change my perspective and I started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day that I didn't I didn't even notice that I took for granted as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong so this is actually a key to happiness for me is to just remember you know when I came over here the car didn't flip over and I didn't trip coming up the stairs it's piano and a remarkable thing. third that thou shalt have reverence this one was unexpected because I started the year as an agnostic and by the end of the year I became what a friend of mine called a reverend agnostic which and I'm trying to start it as a movement so if anyone wants to join the basic ideas whether or not there's a God there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness and that our ritual can be sacred the Sabbath can be sacred this is one of the great things about my year was doing the Sabbath because I am a workaholic so having this one day where you cannot work they really that changed my life so this idea of sacredness whether or not there's a God. that you doubt shall not stereotype this one happened because I I spent a lot of time with various religious communities throughout America cuz I wanted to be more than about my journey I wanted to be about religion in America so I spent time with the evangelico Christensen Hasidic Jews and the Amish I'm very proud because I think I am the only person in America to out Bible talk about Jehovah's Witness after after three and a half hours if he looked at his watch you think I got to go. oh thank you very much thank you bless you bless you so but it was my friend since Evangelical Christianity and and I found that it's such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it there's a group I met with called the red letter Christians and I focus on the red words in the Bible which are the ones that Jesus spoke that's how they printed them in the old Bible and their argument is the Jesus never talked about homosexuality they have a pamphlet that says here's what Jesus says about homosexuality and you open it up and there's nothing in it so. Play Sia Jesus did talk a lot about helping me out cast helping you know helping poor people so this was this was very inspiring to me and I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony campolo they're very inspiring leaders even though I disagree with much of what they say also that I shall not disregard the irrational this one was was very unexpected because you know I grew up with the scientific worldview and when I was shocked was learning how much of my my life is governed by irrational forces and the thing is if they're not harmful they're not to be completely dismissed because I learned that the I was thinking I was doing all these rituals these biblical rituals you know separating my wool and linen and I would ask these religious people won't you know. I want to go to Bible possibly tell us to do this why would God care and I said you know we don't know but it's just ritual and that give us meaning and I say you know but that's crazy and then I would say well what about you you you blow out candles on top of a birthday cake if a guy from ours came down and saw here's one guy blowing candles out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed Fabrics with the Martian say he makes sense crazy so no I think that are rituals are by Nature irrational so the key is to choose the right rituals the ones that that are not harmful but that but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed and finally. I learned that thou shalt pick and choose and that's when I learned because I tried to follow everything in the Bible and I failed miserably because you can't you have to pick and choose and anyone who follows the Bible is going to be picking and choosing the key is to pick and choose the right parts there's a phrase called a cafeteria religion and the fundamentalists will use it as in a denigrating way they'll say I was just cafeteria religion here is picking and choosing the my argument is what's wrong with cafeterias I've had some great meal the cafeterias I've also had some meals that made me want to drive you so it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion about tolerance about loving your neighbor as opposed to the part about homosexuality is a sin or intolerance or violence which are very much in the Bible as well so we have to if we are to find any. in this book then we have to really engage it and wrestle with it and I thought I died and just a couple of more there's me reading the Bible that's how I hail taxi cab. seriously and it worked and that was actually a rented sheeps and I had to return that in the morning but but it served well for a day so anyway thank you so much for letting me speak,0.6888020634651184,"0.7396, 0.8073,0.7969, 0.8177,0.7188,0.6380"
1,AaronHuey_2010X.sph.wav,we have indeed taken the best part of the meat so let 's look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain and know that when you see these people 's faces that these are not just images of the lakota they stand for all indigenous people on this piece of paper is the history the way i learned it from my lakota friends and family i'm here today to show my photographs of the lakota many of you may have heard of the lakota or at least the larger group of tribes called sixty six the beginning of the transcontinental railroad a new era we appropriated land for trails and trains to shortcut through the heart of the lakota nation the treaties were out the window in response three tribes led by the lakota chief red cloud attacked and defeated the u s army many times over i want to repeat that part the lakota defeat the u s army sixty eight the second fort laramie treaty clearly guarantees the sovereignty of the great sioux nation and the lakotas ownership of the sacred black hills the lakota are one of many tribes that were moved off their land to prisoner of war camps now called reservations the pine ridge reservation seventy one the indian appropriation act makes all indians wards of the federal government in addition the military issued orders forbidding western indians from leaving reservations the move destroyed the reservations making it easier to further subdivide and to sell with every passing generation most of the surplus land i believe to be the most important in this slide show this is the year of the wounded knee massacre to this day this is the most medals of honor ever awarded for a single battle more medals of honor were given for the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children than for any battle in world war one world war two korea vietnam iraq or afghanistan the wounded knee massacre is considered the end of the indian wars whenever i visit the site of the mass grave at wounded knee now if any of you have ever heard of aim the american indian movement or of russell means or leonard peltier or of the stand off at oglala i see it not just a grave for the lakota or for the sioux but as a grave for all indigenous peoples the holy man black elk said i did not know then how much was ended when i look back now from this high hill of my old age i can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch when i saw them with eyes still young and i can see that something else died there in the bloody mud and was buried in the blizzard a people 's dream died there and it was a beautiful dream with this event a new era in native american history began everything can be measured before wounded knee and after because it was in this moment with the fingers on the triggers of the hotchkiss guns the court determined that when the sioux were resettled onto reservations and seven million acres of their land were opened up to prospectors and homesteaders the terms of the second fort laramie treaty had been violated the court stated that the black hills were illegally taken and that the initial offering price plus interest should be paid to the sioux nation ten statistics about native population today more than a century after the massacre at wounded knee reveal the legacy of colonization forced migration and treaty violations at least sixty percent of the homes on the reservation are infested with black mold more than ninety percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line the tuberculosis rate on pine ridge is approximately eight times higher than the u s national average the infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent and is about three times higher than the u s national average the last chapter in any successful genocide is the one in which the oppressor can remove their hands and say my god what are these people doing to themselves they're killing each other they're killing themselves while we watch them die this is how we came to own these united states this is the legacy of manifest destiny prisoners are still born into prisoner of war camps long after the guards are gone these are the bones left after the best meat has been has been taken a long time ago a series of events was set in motion by a people who look like me by wasichu eager to take the land and the water and the gold in the hills those events led to a domino effect that has yet to end as removed as we the dominant society may feel what is the connection between these images of suffering and the history that i just read to you and how much of this history do you need to own even is any of this your responsibility today been told that there must be something we can do there must be some call to action because for so long i've been standing on the sidelines content to be a witness just taking photographs because the solution seems so far in the past i needed nothing short of a time machine to access them the suffering of indigenous peoples is not a simple issue to fix it's not something everyone can get behind the way they get behind helping haiti of ending aids or fighting a famine and invited me again and again over five years but on pine ridge i will always be what is called wasichu and wasichu is a lakota word the fix as it's called may be much more difficult for the dominant society than say a fifty dollar check or church trip to paint some graffiti covered houses or a suburban family donating a box of clothes they don't even want anymore so where does that leave us shrugging our shoulders in the dark the call to action i offer today my ted wish is this honor the treaties give back the black hills it's not your business what they do with them that means non indian but another version of this word means the one who takes the best meat for himself and that's what i want to focus on the one who takes the best part of the meat it means greedy,1,"I'm here today to show my photographs of the Lakota how many of you may have heard of Lakota or at least the larger group of tribes called is to. Lakota I won't have any tribes Who removed off their land to prisoner-of-war camps now called reservations the Pine Ridge reservation the subject of today's slideshow is located about 75 miles Southeast of the Black Hills in South Dakota it is sometimes referred to as prisoner of war camp number 334 and is where the Lakota now live now if any of you have ever heard of the American Indian movement or of Russell Means or Leonard Peltier. or the standoff at Oglala then you know that Pine Ridge is Ground Zero for Native issues in the US. I've been asked to talk a little bit today about my relationship with the Lakota and it's a very difficult one for me because if you haven't noticed for my skin color and white. that is a huge barrier on a native reservation you'll see a lot of people in my photographs today and I become very close with them they welcomed me like family have called me brother and uncle invited me again and again over five years but I'm Pine Ridge I will always be what it's called why sheet you and wash it you is it Lakota word that means non-indian but another version of this word means the one who takes the best meat for himself and that's what I want to focus on the one who takes the best part of the meat it means greedy. to take a look around this auditorium today we are at a private school in the American West sitting in red velvet chairs with money in our pockets. and if we look at our lives we have indeed taken the best part of the meat. so let's look today as a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain and know that when you see these people's faces that these are not just images the Lakota they stand for all indigenous people. on this piece of paper is the history of the way I learned it from my Loco to friends and family. the following is a timeline of treaties made treaties broken and massacres disguised as battles a beginning 1824 what is known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs was created within the war department setting an early tone of aggression in our dealings with the Native Americans 1851 the first Treaty of Fort Laramie was made clearly marking the boundaries of the Lakota Nation according to the treaty those lands are a Sovereign Nation if the boundaries of this treaty had held and there is a legal basis that they should then this is what the US would look like today. 10 years later the Homestead Act signed by President Lincoln Unleashed a flood of white settlers into native lands. 1863 an uprising of Santee Sioux in Minnesota ends with the hanging of 38 Sue men the largest mass execution in US history the execution was ordered by President Lincoln only 2 days. after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation. 1866 the beginning of the Transcontinental Railroad a new era we appropriated land for trails and trains too short cut to the heart of the Lakota Nation the treaties are out the window and response three tribes led by the Lakota Chief Red Cloud attacked and defeated the US Army many times over I want to repeat that part the Lakota defeat the US Army. 1868 the second Fort Laramie treaty clearly guarantee is the sovereignty of the great Sioux Nation and the code is ownership of the Sacred Black Hills the government also promised land and hunting rights in the surrounding states we promised that the Powder River Country will henceforth be closed to all whites the treaty seem to be a complete victory for Red Cloud in the Sioux in fact this is the only war in American history. in which the government negotiated a Peace by conceding everything demanded by the enemy. 1869 the Transcontinental Railroad was completed I began carrying among other things large numbers of hunters who began the wholesale killing of Buffalo eliminating a source of food and clothing and shelter for the seal 1871 the Indian appropriation act makes all Indians Wards of the federal government in addition the military issued orders forbidding western Indians from leaving reservation. all western Indians at that point in time where now prisoners of War. also in 1871 when did the time of treaty making problem with treaties is that they allow tries to exist as Sovereign Nations and we can't have that we have plans. 1874 General George Custer announce the discovery of gold in Lakota territory specifically the Black Hills the news of gold creates a massive influx of white settlers into Lakota Nation Custer recommends that Congress find a way to end the treaties with the Lakota as soon as possible. 1875 Lakota War begins with a violation of the Fort Laramie treaty. 1876 on July 26th on its way to attack a Lakota Village Custer 7th Cavalry was crushed the battle of the Little Bighorn. 1877 the great Lakota Warrior and chief Crazy Horse surrendered at Fort Robinson he was later killed while in custody. 1877 is also the year we found a way to get around the Fort Laramie treaty with the new agreement was presented to sue Chiefs and their Leading Men under campaign known as seller starve sign the paper or no food for your tribe only 10% of the adult male population signed the Fort Laramie treaty called for at least three quarters of the tribe to sign away land. applause was obviously ignored 1887 the Dawes Act communal ownership of reservation Lands End reservations are cut up into 160 Acres sections and distributed to individual Indians with a surplus disposed of tribes lost millions of Acres. the American dream of individual land ownership turned out to be a very clever way to divide the reservation until nothing was left to move destroyed the reservations making it easier to further subdivide and sell with every passing generation most of the Surplus land and many of the plots within reservation boundaries are now in the hands of white ranchers once again the fat of the land goes to Ouachita. 1890 a date I believe to be the most important in this slideshow this is the year of the Wounded Knee massacre. on December 29th US troops surrounded assume encampment at Wounded Knee Creek and massacred Chief Bigfoot and three hundred prisoners of War using a new rapid-fire weapon that fired exploding shell call the Hotchkiss gun. for the so-called battle 20 Congressional Medal of Honor for Valor were given to the 7th Cavalry. to this day. this is the most Medals of Honor ever awarded for a single battle. more Medals of Honor were given for the indiscriminate Slaughter of women and children than for any battle in World War 1 World War II Korea Vietnam Iraq or Afghanistan. the Wounded Knee Massacre is considered the end of the Indian Wars. whenever I visit the site of the mass grave at Wounded Knee I see it not just to the Grave the Lakota or for the zoo visit gray for all indigenous peoples. the holy man Blackhawks head. I did not know then how much was ended. when I look back now from this high heel of my old age I can still see the butchered women and children line heat than scattered all along the Crooked Gulch. is playing his when I saw them with eyes still young. and I can see the something else died there in the bloody mud. who was buried in the blizzard. a people's dream died there. and it was a beautiful dream. with this event a new era in Native American history began. everything can be measured before Wounded Knee and after because it was in this moment with the fingers on the triggers of the Hotchkiss guns that the US government openly declared its position on Native rights they were tired of treaties they were tired of sacred Hills they were tired of ghost dances. they were tired of all the inconveniences of the Sioux. so they brought out the cannons. you want to be an Indian now they said finger on the trigger. 1900. u.s. Indian population reaches low point less than 250,000 compared to an estimated 8 million in 1492. fast forward. 1980 the longest running court case in US history the Sioux Nation versus the United States was ruled upon by the US Supreme Court. the court determined that when the Surah settled on the reservations and 7 million Acres of their land were opened up the Prospectors and homesteaders the terms of the second Fort Laramie treaty had been violated the court stated that the Black Hills were illegally taken in at the initial offering price plus interest to be paid to the Sioux Nation as payment for the Black Hills the court awarded only a hundred and six million dollars to the Sioux Nation the Sioux refused the money with the rallying cry the Black Hills are not for sale. 2010. statistics about native population today more than a century after the massacre at Wounded Knee revealed the legacy of colonization forced migration and treaty violations. unemployment on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation fluctuates between 85 and 90% the housing office is unable to build new structures and existing structures are falling apart many are homeless and those with homes are packed into rotting buildings left to five families 39% of homes on Pine Ridge have no electricity at least 60% of the homes on the reservation are infested with black mold more than 90% of the population lives below the federal poverty line the tuberculosis rate on Pine Ridge is approximately 8 times higher than the u.s. national average infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent and is about three times higher than the u.s. national average cervical cancer is five times higher than u.s. national average school dropout rate is up to 70% teacher turnover is 8 times higher than the US national average. frequently grandparents are raising their grandchildren because parents due to alcoholism domestic violence and general apathy cannot raise them. 50% of the population over the age of 40 suffers from diabetes. the life expectancy for men is between 46 and 48 years old roughly the same as Afghanistan and Somalia. the last chapter in any successful genocide is the one in which the oppressor can remove their hands and say my God what are these people doing to themselves they're killing each other they're killing themselves while we watch them die. this is how we came to own these United States this is the legacy of manifest destiny. prisoners are still born in the prisoner-of-war camps long after the guards are gone. these are the bones left after the best meat has been taken. a long time ago a series of events was set in motion by a people who look like me by what she too eager to take the land and the water in the gold in the Hills. does it bends light to a domino effect that has yet to end. as removed as we the dominant Society may feel. from a massacre in 1890 World Series of broken treaties 150 years ago I still have to ask you the question. how should you feel about the statistics of today. what is the connection between these images of suffering and the history that I just read to you. how much of this history do you need to own even. is any of this your responsibility today. I've been told that there must be something we can do there must be some call to action. because for so long I've been standing on the sidelines content to be a witness just taking photographs. because the solution seems so far in the past I needed nothing short of a time machine to access them. the suffering of indigenous peoples is not a simple issue to fix. it's not something everyone can get behind the way they get behind helping Haiti or ending AIDS were fighting a famine the fix as it's called may be much more difficult for the dominant society and say a $50 check or church trip to paint some graffiti-covered houses or a Suburban family donating a box of clothes they don't even want anymore. so where does that leave us shrugging their shoulders in the dark. the United States continues on a daily basis to violate the terms of the 1851 and 1868 Fort Laramie treaty with the Lakota the call to action I offer today. my Ted wish is this. under the treaties give back the Black Hills it's not your business what they do with them. 25% of the world's Food Supplies lost spoilage 458 billion dollars worth every year. so we can know how far food travel monitor temperature all the way to the market we make it safer that's what I'm working on a planet",0.7135416269302368,"0.6328,0.6146,0.6016,0.7943"
2,AdamGrosser_2007.sph.wav,and then as the ammonia re evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side it creates a powerful cooling effect so it was a great idea that didn't work at all it blew up because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong it topped four hundred psi the ammonia was toxic it sprayed everywhere but it was kind of an interesting thought so the great thing about two thousand and six is there's a lot of really great computational work you can do so we got the whole thermodynamics department at stanford involved a lot of computational fluid dynamics we proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong we found some non toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures this is a work in process based on some comments that were made at ted two years ago about the need for the put it into a container and it will refrigerate for twenty four hours it looks like this this is the fifth prototype it's not quite done weighs about eight pounds,1,this is a work in process based on some comments that were made at Ted 2 years ago about the need for the storage of vaccine. so 29 years ago I had this Thermo teacher who talked about absorption Refrigeration is one of those things that stuck in my head it's a lot like the stirling engine was cool but you didn't know what to do with it and it was invented in 1858 by the sky Ferdinand car I bet he couldn't actually build anything with it because of the of the tools of the time it's crazy crazy Canadian in Powell Crosley commercialize this thing called the icy ball 1928 and it was a really neat idea and I'll get to why it didn't work but here's how it works there's two spheres in the separated in distance one has a working fluid water and ammonia the other is a is a condenser you heat up one side the hot side the ammonia evaporates in a tree condenses in the other side he let it cool to room temperature. and then of the ammonia Rhea vaporation combines with the water back on the earth while hotside it creates a powerful cooling effect so it was great idea didn't work at all they blew up that lid because of using about you you got hugely High pressures if you did it if you heated the wrong I get a topped 400 PSI the ammonia was toxic it sprayed everywhere but it's kind of interesting thought so. 2006 there's a lot of really great computational work you can do so we got the whole throw in that department of Stanford involved lot of computational fluid dynamics we proved the most of the ammonia Refrigeration tables are wrong we found some non-toxic refrigerants that work at very low Vapor pressures brought in a team from the UK there's a lot of great Refrigeration people turned down in the UK and built the test rig and proved that in fact we could make a low-pressure non-toxic refrigerator so it's the way it works you put it on a cooking fire most people have cooking fires in the world where is camel dung her with the Heats up for about 30 minutes. cools for an hour. put it into a container in the refrigerator for 24 hours it looks like this this is the fifth prototype not quite done with about 8 lb and it works you put it into a 15 liter vessel about three gallons and it'll cool it down to just above freezing three degrees above freezing for 24 hours in a 30° C environment it's really cheap we think we can build these in high volumes for about $25 and low volumes for about $40 and we think we can make a refrigeration something that everybody can have thank you,0.6106770634651184,0.6302
3,AdamSadowsky_2010X.sph.wav,we came up with a list of they wanted band integration that is the machine acting upon the band members specifically not the other way around they wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling so as the song picks up emotion so should the machine get grander in its process they wanted us to make use of the space so we have this ten thousand sq ft warehouse we were using divided between two floors it included an exterior loading dock we used all of that including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through they wanted it messy and we were happy to oblige hi there i'm going to be talking a little bit about music machines and life the machine itself would start the music so the machine would get started it would travel some distance reacting along the way hit play on an ipod or a tape deck or something that would start playback and the machine would maintain synchronization throughout and speaking of synchronization they wanted it to sync to the rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way they wanted it to end precisely on time okay so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect and they wanted the music to drop out at a certain point in the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song and as if that wasn't enough all of these incredibly complicating things right they wanted it in one shot okay so just some statistics about sort of what we went through in the process the machine itself has eighty nine distinct interactions or more specifically what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video some of you may recognize this image this is the opening frame of the video that we created it took us eighty five takes to get it on film to our satisfaction of those eighty five takes only three actually successfully completed their we destroyed two pianos and ten televisions in the process we went to home depot well over a hundred times and we lost one high heeled shoe when one of our engineers heather knight left her high heeled shoe after a nice dinner and returned back to the build and left it in a pile of stuff and another engineer thought well that would be a really good thing to use and ended up using it as a really nice trigger and it's actually in the machine so what did we learn from all of this well having completed this we have the opportunity to step back and reflect on some of the things and we learned that small stuff stinks little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust and they fall out of the tracks the exact angles makes it hard to get right and yet a bowling ball will always follow the same path it doesn't matter what temperature it is doesn't matter what's in its way it will pretty much get where it needs to go but as much as the small stuff stinks we needed somewhere to start so that we would have somewhere to go and so you have to start with it you have to focus on it small stuff stinks what else planning is incredibly important you know we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things it's been said that no battle plan survives contact with the enemy i think our enemy was physics and she's a cruel mistress often we had to pull things out as a result because of timing or aesthetics or whatever and so while planning is important so is flexibility these are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine be showing the video at the end but before we do i want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted now when we first started talking to ok go the name of the song is this too shall pass real car near the end of the video the big real car works every time there's no problem about it the little one had a tendency to try to run off the track and that's a problem but you don't want to have to reset the whole machine because the lego car at the end doesn't work right so you put that up front so that if it fails at least you know you don't have to reset the whole thing can be were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing months were spent in this tiny cold warehouse and the wonderful elation that we this too shall pass we the they've done we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with and we were very excited about this because of course they have a history of dancing with machines we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted and they explained that they wanted kind of a rube goldberg machine now for those of you who don't know a rube goldberg machine is a so we were excited by this idea and we started talking about exactly what it would look like and we came up with some parameters,1,"hi there I'm going to be talking a little bit about music machines and life or more specifically what we learn from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video some of you may recognize this image this is the opening frame of the video that we created will be showing the video at the end but before we do I want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted when we first started talking to OK Google the name of the song is this too shall pass we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they can dance with and we were very excited about this because of course they have a history of dancing with machines they're responsible for this video here it goes again 50 million + views on YouTube for guys dancing on treadmills you do no Cuts just a static camera a fantastically viral and wonderful video so we were really excited about working with them and. we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted and they explained that they wanted kind of a Rube Goldberg machine now for those of you who don't know a Rube Goldberg machine is a complicated Contraption an incredibly over-engineered piece of Machinery that accomplishes a relatively simple task so we were excited by this idea and we started talking about exactly what it would look like and we came up with some parameters that you know because building Rube Goldberg machine is you know has has limitations but it also is pretty wide open and we want to make sure that we did something that would work for a music video so. we came up with a list of requirements The Ten Commandments and they were in order of ascending difficulty the first is no magic everything that happened on screen had to be very easily understood by a typical viewer the rule of thumb was it if my mother couldn't understand it then we couldn't use it in the video they wanted band integration that is the machine acting upon the band members specifically not the other way around they wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling so as the song picks up emotion so should the machine get Grandeur and it's processed they wanted us to make use of the space so we have this 10,000 square-foot Warehouse we were using divided between two floors and included an exterior loading dock we used all of that including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through they wanted it messy and we were happy to oblige. the machine itself would start the music so the machine we get started it would travel some distance reacting along the way hit play on an iPod or a tape deck or something that would start playback and the Machine would maintain synchronization throughout and speaking of synchronization they wanted it to sync to the Rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way. okay they wanted to end precisely on time okay so now we start to finish timing has to be perfect and they wanted the music to drop about at a certain point of the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song. and as if that wasn't enough all of these incredibly complicating things right they wanted it in one shot. okay. just some statistics about sort of what we went through in the process the machine itself has 89 distinct interactions took us 85 takes to get it on film to our satisfaction of those 85 takes only three actually successfully completed their run. we destroyed two pianos and 10 televisions in the process. we went to Home Depot well over 100 times. and we lost one high heel shoe when one of our Engineers Heather Knight left her high-heeled shoe after a nice dinner and return back to the build and left it in a pile of stuff and another engineer thought that would be a really good thing to use and ended up using it as a really nice trigger and it's exactly in the machine. so what did we learn from all of this having completed this week at the opportunity to step back and reflect on some of the things and we learned that small stuff stinks little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust and they fall out of the tracks in the exact angles makes it hard to to get right and yet a bowling ball will always follow the same path doesn't matter what temperature it is doesn't matter what's in it so it will pretty much get where it needs to go but as much as the small stuff stinks we needed somewhere to start so that we would have somewhere to go until you have to start with that you have to focus on it small stuff stinks but of course it's essential right what else planning is incredibly important. you know we spend a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things it's been said that no battle plan survives contact with the Enemy I think our enemy was physics and. she's a cruel mistress and I often we had to pull things out as a result because of timing or Aesthetics or whatever and so while planning is important so is flexibility these are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine so also put reliable stuff last. the stuff is going to run every time write again small to large is relevant here the little Lego car in the beginning of the video references the big real car near the end of the video the big real car works every time there's no problem about at the little one had a tendency to try to run off the track and that's a problem so but you don't want to have to reset the whole machine because the Lego car at the end it doesn't work right so you put that up front so that the cat fails at least you know you're going to have to reset the whole thing life. Canby. Messi. they were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing months were spent in this tiny cold warehouse and it was wonderful relation that we went we had when we finally completed it so it's important to remember that whether it's good or it's bad this too shall pass. thank you very much. and now to introduce their music video we have OK Google. hello tedxuiuc we are okay go what are you doing just hanging out with curiosity cabinet I mean curiosity Towers. hello 10x u.s.c. we are okay go and is there a new video just to show. okay when we can still do on that I think yet. investment in Broadband high-speed internet can help small businesses create new American jobs small businesses are being formed dreams are being launched and it AT&T we're investing billions to upgrade and build out our wired and wireless networks now is not the time to stall momentum or stifle Innovation or investment jobs dreams and the future are at stake AT&T you are World delivered",0.7890625,"0.8073,0.7656"
4,AdamSavage_2008P.sph.wav,and i thought to myself wouldn't it be great if i had my own dodo skeleton and so i want to point out here at this point that my life obsessed by objects and the stories that they tell and this was the very latest one so i began looking around for to see if anyone sold a some kind of model that i could get and i found lots of reference material lots of lovely pictures no dice no dodo skeleton for me but the damage had been done i had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my creative projects folder it's a repository for my brain everything that i could possibly be interested in any time i have an internet connection there's a sluice of stuff moving into there everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos the key that the marquis du lafayette sent to george washington to celebrate the storming of the russian nuclear launch key the one on the top is the picture of the one i found on ebay the one on the bottom is the one i made for myself because i couldn't afford the one on about four years the new yorker published an article about a cache of dodo bones that was found in a pit on the island of mauritius now the island of maybe yeah maybe i could make my own dodo skull i should point out at this time i'm not a sculptor i'm a hard edged model maker you give me a drawing you give me a prop to replicate you give me a something like this my friend mike murnane sculpted this it's a maquette for star wars episode two this is not my thing i this is something other people do dragons soft things however i felt like i had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicate it i mean it couldn't be that difficult so i started looking at the best photos i could find i grabbed all the reference and i found this lovely piece of reference this is someone selling this on ebay it was a woman 's clearly a woman a s hand hopefully a woman 's hand is a small island off the east coast of madagascar in the indian ocean and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be exactly how long et cetera et cetera and over a few hours i eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull and i didn't mean to continue i it's kind of like you know you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time you can't think about the totality i wasn't thinking about a dodo skeleton i just noticed that as i finished this skull the armature wire that i had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be and one of the other things i'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years is spines and skeletons having collected a couple of hundred i actually understood the mechanics of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them and so button by button vertebrae by vertebrae i built my way down and actually by the end of the day i had a reasonable skull a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis and again i kept on going looking for more reference every bit of reference i could find drawings beautiful photos this guy i love this guy he put a dodo leg bones in a scanner with a ruler you can see that i even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the dodo and tap plastics made me although i didn't photograph it a museum vitrine i don't have the room for this in my house but i had to finish what i had started and this actually represented kind of a sea change to me again like i said my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell and also making them for myself obtaining them appreciating them and extinguished all within about one hundred and fifty years everyone was very excited about this archeological find because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton see and diving into them and in this folder creative projects there are tons of projects that i'm currently working on projects that i've already worked on things that i might want to work on some day and things that i may just want to find and buy and have and and look at and touch but now there was potentially this new category of things that i could sculpt that was different that i you know i have my own r two d two but that's honestly relative to sculpting to me that's easy and so i went back and looked through my creative projects folder and i happened across the maltese falcon now this is funny for me to fall in love with an object from a hammett novel because if it's true that the world is divided into two types of people chandler people and hammett people i am absolutely a chandler person but in this case it's not about it's not about the author it's not about the book or the movie or the story it's about the object in and of itself and in this case this object is plays on a host of and it is very likely the object from which hammett drew his inspiration for the maltese falcon then there is the fictional bird the one that hammett created for the book built out of words it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie in which another object is created a prop that has to represent the thing that hammett created out of words inspired by the kniphauser hawk and this represents the falcon in the movie and then there is this fourth level which is while museums all over the world have dodo skeletons in their collection nobody not even the actual natural history museum on the island of mauritius has a skeleton that's made from the bones of a single dodo a whole new object in the world the prop made for the movie the representative of the thing becomes in its own right a whole other thing a whole new object of desire and so i contacted an antiquarian bookseller who had the original christie 's catalogue and in it i found this magnificent picture which included a size reference i was able to scan the picture blow it up to exactly full size it was made out of resin which wasn't a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made it's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it because i can see it compared to this thing and i can tell you it's real it's the real thing it's made from the exact same mold that this one is in this one because the auction was actually so controversial profiles in history the auction house that sold this and other side elevation so now i had all the topology i needed to replicate the maltese falcon what do they do how do you start something like that i really don't know so what i did was again like i did with the dodo skull i blew all my reference up to full size isn't exactly true the fact is is that the british museum had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the eighteenth century it was actually mummified skin and all feather by feather detail by detail i worked out and achieved working in front of the television and super sculpey here 's me sitting next to my wife it's the only picture i took of the entire process as i moved through i achieved so i went down to my shop and i molded it and i cast it in resin i ended up with this my maltese falcon and it's beautiful and i can state with authority at this point in time when i'd finished it of all of the replicas out there and there is a few this is by far the most accurate representation of the original maltese falcon than anyone has sculpted now the original one i should tell you is sculpted by a guy named fred sexton this is where it gets weird but in a fit of space saving zeal they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire if you go look at their website today they'll actually list these specimens saying the rest was lost in a fire the los angeles county museum of art had a plaster original of the maltese falcon one of the original six plasters i think made for the movie stolen out of the museum a lot of people thought it was a publicity stunt for the movie john 's grill which actually is seen briefly in the maltese falcon is still a viable san francisco eatery counted amongst its regular customers elisha cook who played wilmer cook in the movie and he gave them one of his original plasters of the maltese falcon and they had it in their cabinet for about fifteen years until it got stolen in january of two thousand and seven it would seem that the object of desire only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly so here i had this falcon and it was lovely it looked really great it the light worked on it really well it was better than anything that i could achieve or obtain out in the world but there was a problem and the problem was was that the entirety of the object i wanted the weight behind the object this thing was made of resin and it was too light there's this group online that i frequent it's a group of prop crazies just like me called the replica props forum and it's people who trade make and travel in information about movie props and it turned out that one of the guys there a friend of mine that i never actually met but befriended through some prop deals was the manager of a local foundry he took my master falcon pattern he actually did lost wax casting in bronze for me and this is the bronze i got back and this is after some acid etching the one that i ended up with and this thing it's deeply deeply satisfying to me here i'm going to i going to put it out there later on tonight and you can a i want you to pick it not quite the whole truth anyway the frontispiece of this article was this photo and i'm one of the people that thinks that tina brown was great for bringing photos to the new yorker because this photo yeah i there you can see it's weighing in at twenty seven and a half pounds that's half the weight of my dog huxley but there's a problem now here 's the most recent progression of falcons on the far left is a piece of crap a replica i bought on ebay there's my somewhat ruined sculpey falcon because i had to get it back out of the mold there's my first casting there's my master and there's my bronze that happens when you mold and cast things which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin you lose a little bit of volume you lose a little bit of size and when i held my bronze one up against my sculpey one it was shorter by three quarters of an inch why didn't i remember this why didn't i start and make it bigger so what do i do i figure i have two options one and blown this up big enough to make a three d lithography master of this which i will polish then i will send to the mold maker and then i will have it done in bronze there are several people who own originals and i have been attempting to contact them and reach them hoping that they will let me spend few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds maybe to take a picture or even to pull out the hand held laser scanner that i happen to own that fits inside a cereal box and could maybe without even touching their bird i swear get a perfect three d scan and i'm even willing to sign pages saying that i'll never let anyone else have it except for me in my office i promise i'll give them one if they want it and completely rocked my world i became obsessed with the object not just the beautiful photograph itself and the color the shallow depth of field the detail that's visible the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together there's an entire story here then maybe then i'll achieve the end of this exercise but really if we're all going to be honest with ourselves i have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with was it,1,"about four years ago the New Yorker published an article about a cache of do two bones that was found in a pit on the island of Mauritius now the island of Mauritius is a small island off the east coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered and extinguished all within about a hundred and fifty years because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single do do skeletons eat for museums all over the world have do two skeletons in their collection nobody not even the actual Natural History Museum on the island of Mauritius has a skeleton that's made from the bones of a single do do what this isn't exactly true the fact is that the the British museum had a complete specimen of a Dodo in their collection up until the 18th century skin and all but in a fit of space saving Zeal actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire if you go look at their website today they'll actually list these specimens. the rest was lost in a fire. not quite the whole truth anyway the front piece of this article was this photo and I'm one of the people that think the Tina Brown was great for bringing photos to the New Yorker because this photo completely rocked my world I became obsessed with the object not to say beautiful photograph itself in the color of the shallow depth of field the detail that's visible the why are you can see on the beak there that the conservator use to put the skeleton together there's an entire story here and I thought to myself. would it be great if I had my own do do skeleton. and so I want to point out here at this point. I've spent my life obsessed by by objects and the stores that they tell and this was the very latest one so I began looking around for you see if anyone's oldach it some kind of model that I could get and I found lots of reference material lots of lovely pictures no dice no DOTA skeleton for me but the damage had been done I had saved a few hundred photos of Bill of skeletons into my creative projects go to the repository for my brain everything that I could possibly be interested in any time I have an internet connection there's a sluice of stuff moving into their everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos the key that the Marquis De Lafayette Center George Washington to celebrate the storming of the Bastille Russian nuclear launch key the one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay the one of the bottom is the one I made for myself because I couldn't afford the one on eBay. Stormtrooper costume maps of Middle-earth that's when I hand for myself there's the dodo skeleton folder this folder has 17,000 photos of a 20 GB of information in this growing constantly and one day a week later it might have been maybe a year later I was in the art store with my kids and I was buying some plates was going to have a craft about some super Sculpey some Armature wire some various materials and I look down at the scalping I thought maybe that maybe I could make my own do do skull I should point out at this time I'm not a sculptor I'm a hard Edge model maker you give me a drawing you give me a prop to replicate you give me a crane scaffolding parts from Star Wars especially parts from Star Wars that I can do this stuff all day long it's exactly how I made my living for 15 years but you give me something like this my friend Mike mutnansky open this is Matt cat first Star Wars Episode 2 this is not my thing I hate this is something other people do dragon soft things however I felt like I had. look at enough photos of Dodo skulls to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicated I mean it couldn't be that difficult so I started looking at the best photos I could find I grabbed all the reference and I found this lovely piece of reference this is someone selling this on eBay it was a woman's clearly a woman's head hopefully woman pan assuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand I made some measurements of a thumb that I scared them out to the size of the skull I blew it up to actual size and I began using that along with all the other reference that I had comparing it to it as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beach would be exactly how long it cetera at cetera and over a few hours I eventually achieved it was actually a pretty reasonable. Oops, I didn't mean to continue its kind of like you know you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time you can't think about the totality I wasn't thinking about a Dodo skeleton I just noticed it as I finish this skull the Armature wire that I'd been used to holding it up was sticking out of it would be and one of the other things I've been interested in an obsessed with over the years is fine too. Dillon's having collected a couple of hundred I actually understood the mechanics of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them until button by button vertebrae by vertebrae I built my way down and actually by the end of the day I had a reasonable skull moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis and again I kept on going looking for more reference at every bit of reference I could find drawing beautiful photos this guy love this guy he put a Dodo leg bones on a scanner with a ruler. this is kind of accuracy that I wanted and I just every last item I replicated every last bone and put it in and after about I'd say about six weeks I finished painted mounted my own do do skeleton. but you can see that I even made the museum label for that includes a brief history of the dodo and Tap Plastics made me a little didn't I didn't photograph at the Museum vitrine I don't have the room for this in my house but I had to finish what I had started this actually represent a kind of a sea change to me again like I said my life is been about being fascinated by objects in the stories they tell and also making them for myself obtaining appreciating them and diving into them and in this folder creative projects there are tons of projects that I'm currently working on projects that I've already worked on things that I might want to work on Sunday I think that I may just want to find him bye and have an end and look at in touch but now there was potential this new category of things that I could sculpt that was different that I cannot have my own R2-D2 but that's honestly relative to sculpting to me that's easy and so I went back and look through my head the project folder and I happened across the Maltese Falcon. now this is funny for me to fall in love with an object from a habit novel because if it's true that the world is divided into two types of people Chandler people and having people I am absolutely at Chandler person but in this case it's not about the song about the author it's not about the book or the movie or the or the story it's about the object in and of itself and in this case this object is placed on a host of a host of level first of all there's the object in the world this is the Nippon house or hot it is a ceremonial pouring vessel made around 1,700 for a Swedish count and it is very likely the object from which Hemet drew his inspiration for the Maltese Falcon then there is the fictional bird the one that had created for the book built out of words it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie in which another object is created a prop that has to represent the thing that has been created out of words inspired by the Nippon Hauser Hawk and this represents the Falcon in the movie and then there is this 4th level Witch is a hoe. new object in the world the prop made for the movie the representative of the thing becomes in its own right a whole other thing and whole new object of desire and so now it's time to do some music I actually have done some research of a few years before it's why the folder was there I bought a replica really crappy rapping of the Maltese Falcon on eBay and have some reasonable reference I I discovered in researching further really wanting precise reference that the bird had one of the original lead birds have been sold at Christie's in 1994 and so I contacted an antiquarian Bookseller who had the original Christmas catalog in in and I found this magnificent picture which included the size reference I was able to scan the picture blow it up to exactly full-size I found out the reference IV check my in New Jersey editor actually found this resin Maltese Falcon at a flea market in 1991 although it took him five years to authenticate this. to to to the auctioneers specifications because there's a lot of controversy about it it was made out of resin which wasn't a common fear of the movie props about the time the movie was made it's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it cuz I can see it compared to this thing I can tell you it's real it's the real thing it's made from the exact same old at this one is in this one because the auction was actually so controversial profiles in history the auction house that sold this I think in 1995 for about $100,000 they actually included you can see here on the bottom not just a front elevation but also a side rear and other side elevation so now I had all the time I needed to replicate The Maltese Falcon what do they do how do you start something like that I really don't know so what I did was again like I did with the donuts go light bulb blew all my reference up to full size and then I began cutting out the negatives and using those templates as shape references so I took spell pee I build a big block of it and passed it through until it you know I got the right profiles and then slowly Feather by feather Pete ale by detail. worked out and achieved working in front of the television and super Sculpey here's me sitting next to my wife that's the only picture I took a whole entire process as I move through I achieve a very reasonable facsimile The Maltese Falcon but again I am not a sculptor and so I don't know a lot of the tricks like you you know I don't know how my friend might get some beautiful shiny surfaces with his spelled the I certainly wasn't able to get it so I went down to my shop and I molded it and I cast it in resin because in the resin then I could absolutely get the glass with finished now there's a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finished my preference is about 70 coats of this matte black Auto primer I sprayed on for three or four days it's ripped to hell but it allows me a really really nice gentle sanding service and I can get it glass smooth of finishing up with triple zero still wolf and the great thing about getting it to this point was that because in the movie when they finally bring out the bird at the end and they place it on the table they actually spin it so I was able to actually screenshot and fries. to make sure and I'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that's I'm holding the light in the same position I'm getting the same type of reflection on it that's the level of detail I'm going into this thing I ended up with this my Maltese Falcon and it's beautiful and I can think with authority at this point in time when I'd finished it of all of the replicas out there and there is a few this is by far the most accurate representation of the original Maltese Falcon than anyone has sculpted the original one that should tell you who sculpted by guy named Fred Sexton this is where. It gets weird front section was a friend of this guy George Hodel terrifying guide greed by many to be the killer of the Black Dahlia James ellroy believes that Fred Sexton the sculptures Maltese Falcon kill James El Roy's mother I'll go you one Stranger Than That in 1974 during the production of a weird comedy sequel to The Maltese Falcon call the Blackbird starring George Segal the Los Angeles County Museum of Art had a plaster original of multi stopping one of the original six Plastics I think made for the movie Stolen a lot of people thought it was a publicity stunt for the movie John's Grill which actually is seen briefly in the Maltese Falcon is still a viable San Francisco Eatery I counted among its regular customers Elisha cook who played Wilma cook in the movie and he gave them one of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon and they had it in their cabinet for about 15 years until it got stolen in January of 2007. it would seem that the object of Desire only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly so he has lovely it looked really great the light work on it really well it was better than anything that I could achieve or obtain out in the world but there was a problem no problem was was that. I wanted the entirety of the object I wanted to wait behind the object this thing was made of resin and it was too light there's this group online that I frequent it's a group of prop crazy is just like me he called the replica props for minutes people who trade make and traveling information about movie props and it turned out that one of the guys there a friend of mine that I divided I've never actually met a friend and threw some product deals with the manager of a local Factory he took my master Falcon pattern he actually did lost wax casting in bronze for me and this is the bronze I got back and this is after some acid etching the one that I ended up with an this thing it's deeply deeply satisfying to me here I'm going to I'm going to put it out there later on tonight and you can. I want you to pick it up and handle it. you want to know. how obsessed I am this project only for me and yet I went so far as to buy on eBay a 1941 Chinese San francisco-based newspaper in order so that the bird could properly beer at like it is in the movie. yeah I know. there you can see it's weighing in at 27 and a half pounds that's half the weight of my dog Huxley. but there's a problem. now here's the most recent progression of Falcons on the far left is a piece of crap replica I bought on eBay there's my someone ruined Sculpey Falcon cuz it had to get it back out of the mold there's my first casting there's my master and there's my bronze there's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things which is it every time you throw it in the silicone and casts and resume you lose a little bit of volume and you lose a little bit of side and when I held my bronze one up against my skull on it was short by three quarters of an inch yeah no really it's this was like. why didn't I remember this why did I start and make it bigger. do I figure I have two options one I can fire freaking laser at it which I have already done to do a 3D scan there is a 3D scan of this Falcon I have figured out the exact amount of shrinkage I achieve going to my wax Master to a bronze Master head blow this up big enough to make a 3D lithography master of this which I will polished then I will send to the mold maker and then I will have it done in front door. there are several people who own originals and I have been attempting to contact them and reach them hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds maybe to take a picture or even to pull out the handheld laser scanner that I happen to own the B inside of cereal box and could maybe without even touching their bird I swear yeah that's perfect 3D skin and I'm even willing to sign Pages saying that I'll never let anyone else have it except for me in my office I promise I'll give them one if they wanted and then maybe then I would see the end of this exercise but really if we're all going to be honest with ourselves I have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with was it. thank you",0.8229166865348816,"0.7995,0.7550,0.7240,0.7969,0.7865,0.8464"
5,AditiShankardass_2009I.sph.wav,but diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms without even doing an ecg or a chest x ray to look at the heart it seemed so intuitive to me to diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately it would be necessary to look at the brain directly looking at behavior alone can miss a vital piece of the puzzle and provide an incomplete or even a misleading picture of the child 's problems yet despite all the advances in medical technology the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited and then i came across a team at harvard university that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it instead of in brain research towards diagnosing brain disorders in children their groundbreaking technology records the eeg or the electrical activity of the brain in real time when i was ten years old a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions vision attention language a program called brain electrical activity mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain and another program called statistical probability mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child 's symptoms and so i became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team like to tell you about one such child whose story was also covered by abc news seven year old justin senigar and as a special treat he took me to the pathology lab and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands came to our clinic with this diagnosis of very severe autism like many autistic children his mind was locked inside his body there were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time and the doctors told his parents he was never going to be able to communicate or interact socially and he would probably never have too much language when we used this groundbreaking eeg technology to actually look at justin 's brain the results were startling it turned out that justin was almost certainly not autistic he was suffering from brain seizures that were impossible to see with the naked eye but that were actually causing symptoms that mimicked those of autism after justin was given anti seizure medication the change in him was amazing within a period of sixty days his vocabulary went from two to three words to three hundred words and his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled in a regular school and even became a karate superchamp research shows that fifty percent of children almost fifty percent of children diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures these are the faces of the children that i have tested with stories just like justin all these children and there it was the seat of human consciousness the powerhouse of the human body sitting in my hands came to our clinic with a diagnosis of autism attention deficit disorder mental retardation language problems instead scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn't possibly have been detected by their behavioral assessments so these eeg scans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis and much more targeted treatment for too long now children with developmental disorders have suffered from misdiagnosis while their real problems have gone undetected and left to and for too long these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation but we are now in a new era of neuroscience one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects non invasively and find the true source of so many disabilities in children so if i could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved one more mind will be unlocked and one more child who has been misdiagnosed or even undiagnosed by the system and that day i knew that when i grew up i was going to become a brain doctor scientist something or the other will finally realize his or her true potential while there's still time for his or her brain to recover and all this by simply watching the child 's brainwaves thank you years later when i finally grew up my dream came true and it was while i was doing my ph d on the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that i encountered a startling fact that i'd like to share with you all today it is estimated that one in six children that's one in six children suffer from some developmental disorder this is a disorder that retards mental development in the child and causes permanent mental impairments which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder but here 's what really perplexed me despite the fact that each and every one these disorders originates in the brain most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable behavior,1,when I was 10 years old a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school and as a special treat he took me to the Pathology lab and took a real human brain out of the jaw and placed it in my hands and there it was the seat of human consciousness the PowerHouse of the human body sitting in my hands and that they knew that when I grew up I was going to become a brain doctor scientist something or the other. years later when I finally grew up my dream came true and it was while I was doing my PhD on the neurological causes of Dyslexia in children that I encountered a startling fact that I'd like to share with you all today. it is estimated that one in six children that's one in six children suffer from some developmental disorder this is a disorder that retard mental development in the child and causes permanent mental impairments which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child is suffering from a developmental disorder. but here's what really perplexed me. despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable Behavior. but diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms without even doing any CG or a chest x-ray to look at the heart it seemed so intuitive to me to

happy to say that I'm now in the process of setting up this technology. yeah in India. I'd like to tell you about one such child whose story was also covered by ABC News. seven-year-old Justin synagogue came to a clinic with a diagnosis of very severe autism like many autistic children his mind was locked inside his body they were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time and the doctors told his parents he was never going to be able to communicate or interact socially and he would probably never have too much language. when we use this groundbreaking EG technology to actually look at Justin's brain the results were startling it turned out that Justin was almost definitely not or he was suffering from a brain seizures that were impossible to see with the naked eye but that were actually causing symptoms that mimic those of autism. after Justin was given Auntie seizure medication the change in him was amazing within a period of 60 days his vocabulary went from 2 to 3 was to 301 and his communication and social interaction with improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school and even became a karate Supertramp research shows that 60% of children almost 50% of children diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures. these are the faces of the children that I have tested with stories just like Justin. all these children came to a clinic with a diagnosis of autism attention deficit disorder mental retardation language problems instead of EG scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn't possibly have been detected by the behavioral assessments so these egscans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis and much more targeted treatment. the too long now children with developmental disorders have suffered from Ms diagnosis while they're real problems have gone undetected and left Wilson and for too long these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and Desperation but we are now in a new era of Neuroscience one in which we can find any look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects non-invasively and find the true source of so many disabilities in children. so if I could Inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved one moment will be unlocked and one more child who is being misdiagnosed or even undiagnosed by the system will finally realize his or her true potential while there's still time for his or her brain to recover and all this by simply watching the child's brain waves thank you. the electric grid was conceived in the age of Edison designed in age of Eisenhower installed in the age of Nixon and it has not been upgraded since it's just not able to keep up with modern need. but the notion of the smart grid is using what we have better making do with what we've got and not build so much new infrastructure software I think Gateway between generation and transmission can solve that problem it was Margaret is actually a bunch of smart devices connected over a network to a bunch of computers and computers brunch all this data and then are able to optimize the system what we're working on is helping utilities see what's actually happening in real time and terms the flow of electricity between all those devices benefits to Consumers benefits the environment all because of things we can now see so we couldn't see before on the Olympic Peninsula the smart grid tangible we were taking home area networks as a way of sending messages to the homes into the devices in the homes about when they should run or not run. there was one other modem hear that absurd wirelessly the reports from the different elements we saved approximately during this time 15% of our electric bill if we can do that for everybody in the country were talking about saving a hundred billion dollars worth of infrastructure that we won't need to build IBM it made the first big company to really see the opportunity to marry Information Technology with the grid there are several things going on in South America Asia in Europe we've been working with Malta to make both of water and electricity systems much more efficient it is a model for how we can then bring that to other larger Geographic areas the path forward was Margaret is actually quite clear if we upgraded our telecommunications networks are satellite networks and we can do the exact same thing with the smart grid I went plant will go up and down by the minute a solar plant will go up and down as clouds go over so having a grid that can Flex itself in May. these these kinds of things it's critical we need to be planning for the kind of future that we say we want which is an era of cheap reliable clean electricity for a decade to come,0.6783853769302368,"0.6797,0.7943,0.6771"
6,AdoraSvitak_2010.sph.wav,for better or worse we kids aren't hampered as much when it comes to thinking about reasons why not to do things kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking like my wish that no one went hungry or that everything were free kind of utopia how many of you still dream like that and believe in the possibilities on the other hand we kids still dream about perfection and that's a good thing because in order to make anything a reality you have to dream about it first in many ways our audacity to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility for instance the museum of glass in tacoma washington my home state yoohoo washington now i want to start with a question when was the last time you were called childish for kids like me being called childish can be a frequent occurrence our inherent wisdom doesn't have to be insiders knowledge kids already do a lot of learning from adults teachers and students and i like this analogy it shouldn 't just be a teacher at the head of the classroom telling students do this do that the students should teach their teachers learning between grown ups and kids should be reciprocal the reality unfortunately is a little different and it has a lot to do with trust or a lack of it don't trust someone you place restrictions on them right if i doubt my older sister 's ability to pay back the ten percent interest i established on her last loan i'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me until she pays it back true story by the way to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids from every don 't do that don 't do this in the school handbook to restrictions on school internet use as history points out regimes become oppressive when they're fearful about keeping control and although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes kids have no or very little say in making the rules when really the attitude should be reciprocal meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population now what's even worse than restriction is that adults often underestimate kids abilities we love challenges but when expectations are low trust me we will sink to them to write from the age of four and when i was six my mom bought me my own laptop equipped with microsoft word thank you bill gates and thank you ma i wrote over three hundred short stories on that little laptop and i wanted to get published many publishers were not quite so encouraging one large children 's publisher ironically saying that they didn't work with children we are called childish which really bothers me after all take a look at these events imperialism and colonization and from there on it's gone to speaking at hundreds of schools keynoting to thousands of educators and finally today speaking to you i appreciate your attention today because to show that you truly care you listen but just like you really the goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult but rather better adults than you have been which may be a little challenging considering your guys credentials no matter your position of place in life it is imperative to create opportunities for children so that we can grow up to blow you away because we are the leaders of tomorrow which means we're going to be taking care of you when you're old and senile no just kidding world wars george w bush ask yourself who 's responsible really we are going to be the next generation the ones who will bring this world forward and in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you now the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas kids need opportunities to lead and succeed what have kids frank touched millions with her powerful account of the holocaust ruby bridges helped end segregation in the united states and most recently charlie simpson to raise one hundred and twenty thousand pounds for haiti on his little bike so as you can see evidenced by such examples age has absolutely nothing to do with it the traits the word childish addresses are seen so often in adults that we should abolish this age discriminatory word when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility say that certain types of irrational thinking exactly what the world needs maybe you've had grand plans before but stopped yourself thinking that's impossible or that costs too much or that won 't benefit me,1,"don't want to start with the question when was the last time you were called childish for kids like me being called childish can be a frequent occurrence every time we make irrational demands exhibit irresponsible Behavior or display any other signs of being normal American citizens we are called childish which really bothers me after I'll take a look at these events imperialism in colonization world wars George W bush ask yourself who is responsible I don't know what them kids done pool and Frank touched Millions with their powerful account of the Holocaust Ruby Bridges helped to end segregation in the United States and most recently Charlie Simpson helped to raise 120,000 pounds for Haiti on his little bike was even see evidence by such example age has absolutely nothing to do with it the traits the word childish. dresses are seen so often in adults that we should have bought us the sage discriminatory word when it comes to criticizing Behavior associated with your responsibility and irrational thinking. thank you again who's the say that certain types of irrational thinking aren't exactly what the world needs maybe you've had Grand plans before but stopped yourself thinking about some possible or that cost too much of that won't benefit me for better or sweet kids aren't hampered as much when it comes to things that reasons why not to do things kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking like my wish that Norman hungry towards everything were free kind of Utopia how many of you still dream like that and believe in the possibilities sometimes a knowledge of history in the past failures of utopian ideals can be a burden because you know that if everything were free then the food stocks and become depleted and scare some leads to chaos on the other hand we kids still dream about perfection and that's a good thing because in order to make anything or reality you have to. dream about it first in many ways are dassey to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility for instance the Museum of Glass in Tacoma Washington my home state you to Washington has a program called kids design glass in kids draw their own ideas for glass are now the resin artist says they got some of their best ideas from the program because kids don't think about the limitations of how hard it can be to blow glass in a certain shapes they just think of good ideas now when you think of glass you might sing of colorful Chihuly designs or maybe Italian vases but kids challenge last czars to go beyond that into the realm of broken hearted snakes and bacon boys so you can see as meat vision. our inherent wisdom doesn't have to be Insider's Knowledge Kids already do a lot of learning from adults and we have a lot to share I think that adults should start learning from kids do I do most of my speak in front of an education crowd teachers and students and I like this analogy just be a teacher at the head of the classroom telling soon to do this do that the students should teach their teachers learning between grownups and kids should be reciprocal the reality unfortunately is a little different and it has a lot to do with trust for a lack of it if you don't trust them when you place restrictions on the right if I doubt my older sister's ability to pay back to 10% interest she has established on her last load I'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me until she pays it back. True Story by the way I don't seem to have a don't seem to have a presently restrictive attitude towards kids from every don't do that don't do this in the school handbook do structions on school internet use of History points out regime has become pressive when they're fearful about keeping them Troll And although it may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes kids have no or very little say in making the rules when really that attitude should be reciprocal meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population in restriction is the adults often underestimate kids abilities we love challenges but when expectations are low trust me we will sing to them. my own parents had anything but low expectations for me and my sister okay so they didn't tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that but my dad did read about Aristotle and Pioneer germ Fighters when lots of other kids were hearing the wheels on the bus go round and round while we heard that one too but Pioneer germ Fighters totally rules. I love to write from the age of four and when I was 6 my mom bought me my own laptop equipped with Microsoft Word thank you Bill Gates and thank you Mom I wrote over 300 short stories on that little laptop and I wanted to get published instead of just scoffing at this heresy that kid 1 to get published or saying wait until you're older my parents were really supportive many Publishers were not quite so encouraging one large children's publisher ironically saying they didn't work with children children's publisher not work for children I don't know you kind of alienating large client there. one publisher action publishing was willing to take that leap and trust me and listen to what I had to say they publish my first book flying fingers you see here and from there on Ice gone to speaking at hundreds of schools keynote in the thousands of Educators and finally today speaking to you I appreciate your attention today because the show that you truly care you listen. but there's a problem with this Rosy picture of kids being so much better than adults kids grow up and become adults just like you. or just like you really the goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult but rather better adults than you would have been which may be a little challenging consider your guys credentials but the way progress happens is because new generations and new era's grow and develop and become better than the previous once it's the reason we're not in the Dark Ages anymore no matter your position or place in life it is imperative create opportunities for children so that we can grow up to blow you away. adults and fellow testers you need to listen and learn from kids and trust us and expect more from us. you must lend an ear today because we are the leaders of Tomorrow it means we're going to be taking care of you and your oldest son I'll know just kidding no really we are going to be the Next Generation the one who will bring this world for work and in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you remember that cloning is possible and that involves going through childhood again and which case you want to be heard just like my generation the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas kids need opportunities to lead and succeed are you ready to make the match because the world's problems shouldn't be the human family's heirloom thank you. thank you thank you. the electric grid was conceived in the age of Edison designed in age of Eisenhower installed in the age of Nixon and it has not been upgraded since it's just not able to keep up with modern needs. open ocean of the smart grid is using what we have better making do with what we've got and not build so much new infrastructure software at the Gateway between generation and transmission can solve that problem who is Margaret is actually a bunch of smart devices connected over a network to a bunch of computers and computers brunch all this data and then are able to optimize the system what we're working on is helping utilities see what's actually happening in real time and terms of the flow of electricity between all those devices benefits to Consumers benefits the environment all because of things we can now see so we couldn't see before on the Olympic Peninsula is goal was to make the smart grid tangible we were taking home area networks as a way of sending messages to the homes and to the devices in the home is about when they should run or not run. there was one other modem here that absurd wirelessly the reports from the different elements we save approximately during this time 15% of our electric bill if we can do that for everybody in the country were talking about saving a hundred billion dollars worth of infrastructure that we won't need to build IBM admit at first big company to really see the opportunity to marry Information Technology with the grid there are several things going on in South America Asia in Europe we've been working with Malta to make both of water and electricity systems much more efficient it is a model for how we can then bring that to other larger Geographic areas the path forward was Margaret is actually quite clear if we upgraded our telecommunications networks are satellite networks and we can do the exact same thing with the smart grid I went plant will go up and down by the minute a solar plant will go up and down as clouds go over to having a grid that can Flex itself in May. these kinds of things is critical we need to be planning for the kind of future that we say we want which is an era of cheap reliable clean electricity for a decade to come",0.7604166865348816,"0.7682,0.7318,0.7526"
7,AimeeMullins_1998.sph.wav,i stand in these legs my hamstring and my glutes are contracted as i would be had i had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet it's a company in san diego called flex foot and i was a guinea pig and as i hope to continue to be in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out but actually these like i said are still the actual prototype i need to get some new ones because the last so these are the sprint legs and i can put my other your mobility or you know even fashion i mean i love the fact that i can go in anywhere and pick out what i want and the shoes i want the skirts i want i'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people they're also silicon this is like a really basic basic prosthetic limb under here it's like a barbie i mean it's just stuck in this position so i have to wear a two inch heel and i mean it's really it you can see it but like it really is there's veins on the feet and then my heel 's like pink you know and my achilles tendon that moves a little bit and it's really an amazing sort you know that they do these track meets with all disabled runners and i figured oh i don't know about this but before i judge it let me go see what it's all about so i booked myself a flight to boston in ninety five a year and two weeks ago and this is just a silicon piece of skin i mean what happened was two years ago this man in belgium was saying you know god if i can go to madame tussauds wax museum and see we ha luckily the hotel was terrific they got these legs are great i'm doing i'm actually going back in a couple of weeks to get some improvements i want to get legs like these made for for me panting and heaving and i had these legs that were made of like a wood and plastic compound this and know what i was expecting but you know when i saw a man who was missing an entire leg go up to the high jump hop on one leg to the high jump and clear it at six feet two inches dan o 'brien jumped five eleven in ninety six in atlanta i mean if it just gives you a comparison of these are you know truly accomplished athletes without qualifying that word athlete and so i decided to give this a shot and don't have any skill or finesse going down that track you were all over the place we all saw how hard you were working and so i decided to call the track coach at georgetown and i thank god i didn't know just how huge this man is in the track and field world he 's coached thought we'd just talk a little bit and you know the man 's office is lined from floor to ceiling with all ran one race and i i wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete well we should meet first before we decide anything you know he 's thinking what am i getting myself into so i met these posters and magazine covers of people he 's coached and we sat and we got talking and it turned out to be a great partnership because he'd never coached a disabled athlete so therefore he had no on this trip so he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break his free time that i would come up to the track and train with him so that's how i met frank that was fall of ninety five and then by the winter rolling around he said you know you're good enough you can run on our women 's track team here and i said no come those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio it might have given it away i'm a double amputee why don't you tell them like on your way to the olympics but a couple of memorable events happened at georgetown why don't you just tell well you know i'd won everything as far as the disabled meets everything i competed in i was born without fibulas in both legs i was amputated at age one and i've been running like hell better than you and i went out there and made it to the big east which was sort of the championship race and really really hot and it's the first i had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio and i didn't realize at that time that you know the amount of sweating that i would be doing in the sock it actually acted like a lubricant and i'd be kind of pistoning in the socket and at about eighty five meters of my one hundred meters sprint in all my glory i came out of my leg like i almost came out of it in front of like five thousand people i i mean just mortified and because i was signed up for the two hundred a there's no way i'm going two hundred meters and he just sat there and you know my pleas fell on deaf ears thank god because he was like you know the man 's from brooklyn he 's a big i the two years you've been running am no a year cheryl a year and why don't you tell them what happened right before you go run your race am okay well atlanta the paralympics just for a little bit of clarification are the olympics for people with physical here we are like a week after the olympics and down at atlanta and i'm just blown away by the fact that you know a year ago i got out on a gravel track and couldn't run fifty meters and so here i am never lost i set new records at the u s nationals the olympic trials that may and was just you know sure that i was coming home with the gold i was also the only planar foot so we can't get off on the springboard i said well i just did it no one told me that so it's funny i'm three inches within the world record and kept on from that point you know so i'm signed up in the long jump signed up no i made it for the long jump and the one hundred meter and i'm sure of it you know i made the front page of my hometown paper that i delivered for six years you know it was like this is my time for i was the first person in the world on these legs i was the guinea pig and what kind of you know who 'm i running against here oh aimee we'll have to get back to you on that one i wanted to find out times don 't worry you 're you know you're doing great this is twenty minutes before my students out of the nation every year to get involved in international affairs and so i won a full ride to georgetown looking the next lane lane two is twelve point eight lane three is twelve point five which one of these is not like the other five golds when i skied and everything i came in first and georgetown you know that was great i was losing but it was the best training because this was atlanta oh my god my whole family you know got in a van and drove down here from pennsylvania and you know i was the only female u s sprinter so you know they call us out and you have one minute and when i was putting my blocks in my last card to play here is at least you know if i'm not going to beat these girls i'm going to and i've been there for four years love it the rocky iv sensation of me versus germany and you know everyone else estonia and poland was in this heat and you know the gun went off and you know finishing last and you know fighting back tears of frustration and aimee got there she decided that she 's kind of curious about track and field so she decided to call someone and start asking about it so why don't you tell i became a collegiate athlete you know i became an olympic athlete and it made me really think about how you know the achievement was getting there i mean the fact that i set my sight just a year and three months before that know and their patience you know to deal with me and that was like this collective glory that there was you know fifty people behind me that had joined in this incredible experience of going to atlanta so i mean it 's i apply this sort of philosophy now to everything i do about like this you know sitting back and realizing the progression like how far you've come at this day to this goal it's important to focus on a goal i think but you know also recognize the progression on the way there and how you've grown as a person you know that's the achievement i think that's the these are my cosmetic legs actually and they're absolutely beautiful to come up and see them there are hair follicles on them and i can paint my toenails and ewing who played for georgetown in the eighties comes back every summer and i had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room because he'd come in with he as i did anyway okay now these are my sprinting legs made of carbon graphite i said got different height am in these cheryl in these am i don't know i don't think really stand on these legs she has to be moving silicon sock and so i run on these and and i'd never competed on a disabled level you know i'd always competed against other able bodied athletes that's all i'd ever known in fact i'd never even met another amputee until i was seventeen and i heard,1,"I thought I thought we just talked a little bit and I wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete. you haven't seen the picture in the end of a biomedical it away I'm a double amputee and I was born without fibulas in both legs amputated 81 and I've been running like hell ever seen, why don't you tell them like how you get to Georgetown where we just start there. service program I want a full academic scholarship out of high school they pick three students as a nation every year to get involved International Affairs and so I say I want a full ride to Georgetown and and. been there for years love it when Amy got there she decided that she kind of curious about track and field so she decided to call someone and start asking about it so why don't you tell that story I've always been involved in sports I played softball for five years going out by Icy competitively throughout high school and I got a little restless and, because I wasn't doing anything for about a year to score twice and I've never competed on a disabled level and I'd always competed against other able-bodied athletes that's all I'd ever known but I've never even met another a potato I was seventeen and I heard the other day that they do these these track meet is all table runner and I figured I don't know about this stuff but I've been before a judge is going to go see what it's all about so I booked myself a flight to Boston and ninety-five to nineteen years old and that definitely the Dark Horse candidate at this race I've never done it. before I went out in the gravel track a couple weeks before this me to see how far I can run it out 50 me enough for me panting and heaving and I had these legs that were made of wood and plastic compound attack with velcro straps big 655 wool socks on you know.then again people wearing black made of all things carbon graphite and no shock absorbers in them and. a man who is missing entire leg go up to the high jump hop on one leg to the high jump and clear it at 62 in Atlanta I mean if it just gives you a comparison of Peter you know truly accomplished athletes without qualify. decide to give us a shot. I ran my first race and I I beat the National Record holder by 3. you've got speed natural speed but you don't have any skill or finesse. I didn't know this how. this man is and the track and field World he's coached by the Olympians and him as offices line from floor to ceiling with all America has certificates he is a rather intimidating figure and I call him up and said I ran One race and I've won and. take me first before we decide anything are you thinking. magazine covers of people he's coached. he never coached a disabled athlete so therefore he had no preconceived notions of what I was or wasn't capable of and I've never been coached before. on this trip so he started giving me. give his lunch lunch break his free time that I would come up to the track in and train with them. but that was fall of 95 and then by the winter rolling around he said you're good enough you can run on our women's track team here. spring of 1996 with my goal of making the US paralympic team that may coming up. Enjoying the women's track team become a disabled person ever done that run out of a Collegiate level so I know it's starting to become an interesting mix. tell them like on your way to the Olympics but a couple of memorable events happened at Georgetown I can just tell him I competed in and out knowing that I was going to get used to seeing the backs of all these women's shirts and I'm running against the next Flo Jo and they're all looking at me like what is going on here and you know putting on my uniform and and I'm going out there and knowing that you know in order to become better. better than you. and I. Baron and hats made it to the Big East which would like from the championship race into the season and really really hot and it's the first day I had just gotten a new printing like that you see in that that bio and I didn't realize at that time that's. 85 M 900 m. all my glory. I'm out of my leg out of it in front of. sign up for the 200. I can't do it thank God because he seems like you put the damn thing back on infant. to the 1996 Paralympics and she's all excited her family's coming down it's a big deal she's now two years you've been running. and why don't you tell them what happened right before you go on your break okay well Atlanta the Paralympics to put to screw a clarification are the Olympics for people with physical disabilities a person with cerebral palsy in wheelchair athletes as opposed to Special Olympics which deals with people with mental disabilities so. Atlanta and I'm just blown away by the fact that you know everything year ago I got out and gravel track and couldn't run 50 meters and so here I am never lost record. it's just you know.the only way to call bilateral geek a below-the-knee I've only want to be doing a long time. world record and kept on. I made it to the long jump in and the 100m and the front page my hometown paper that I delivered for 6 years and. Olympic stadium and these legs that I was on. the guinea pig and. a tourist attraction everyone was taking pictures of. I tried. get out of anybody I could do. for my race in Olympic stadium and they post the heat sheets and I go over my luck and my fastest time with his world record was 15.77. the next plane to is 12.8 - 3 is 12.5. been there I'm missing a hand. oh my god I've never lost any like weather be this. and everything. losing.Atlanta. big. yeah they call it out. lazy one minute. and I blocked in and just feeling horrified to go to the murmur coming over the crowd like I could once you are close enough to. give me versus Germany and you know everyone else finishing last and no fighting back tears of frustration and and incredible incredible that the feeling is being overwhelmed.and I transform my life. I became a Collegiate athlete. it was getting them in the fact that I sent my sight just a year and 3 months before. becoming an Olympic Athlete and staying out here is my life going in this direction and I want to take it here for a while and just seeing how far I could push it and the fact that I asked for help how many people jumped on board. another time. taste. and their patients. that there was 50 people behind me that had joined in this incredible experience going to Atlanta so I mean it's sort of philosophy not everything I do you know how far you've come at this day took to the school and you know I'll also recognized the progression on the way there and how how you've grown as a person and that's the best achievement I think that's a real achievement.these are my. and. they're absolutely beautiful you have to come up with any of them. don't understand but that's mine. 21 shoe store and buy whatever you want to get to take your height I got to pick my height is actually. who played for Georgetown in the 80s comes back every summer and making fun of him in the training room because he couldn't read like a peacock. but I did anyway. okay none of these are my sprinting life made of carbon graphite like I said and make sure I got the right. I got some. Seether. That's my kind of like I have like tennis and softball have a shock absorber. and then this is a silicone thing and I roll over silicone sheets I roll over to keep it on which when I sweat. I don't know. I don't think so. she has to be moving so. not having me so it comes talking since I slept in it. and so I I run on me and I'm shocked at the world on Wii. the actual form of a sprinter when they were on the table watches printers 8 ball of the foot. when I send my hamstring in my glutes are contracted as as I would be had I had feet in there standing on the ball of my of my feet so. the company in San Diego complex but and I was a guinea pig and I hope that you need to be in every every new form of prosthetic limbs I come out but like I said I'll still be a prototype I need to get two new ones because the last me I was at there and it was like a big is put my other. yeah I got in. and I'm the only person United States a piece which is a. you do for me. I want to be feminine off the track and. any capacity whether it's.I'm hoping to try to bring the bring these over here make them accessible to a lot of people there they're also silicone its this is like a really basic basic prosthetic. stuck in this position. and I mean it's really. if you can see it but like it really is there's a. and then my heels like pink eye killie's tendon that moves a little bit and it's in a really amazing to work I got them a year a year and. 2 years ago this man in Belgium the same as wax museum in C. I've looking so real that breathe why can't they build a limb for someone that looks like a leg to do amazing stuff with silica the Arthur Ashe award at the ESPYs and she came into town and she rushed around and she said I have to buy some new shoes. for an hour before the ESPYs and she thought she got in a 2in heel but she'd actually bought a three-inch heel 5 minutes we had to. tell with terrific they got some issues. if anybody here who can help me fix this problem. he's like there are great I'm doing. he's actually going back in a couple weeks to get some improvement they want to get legs like these made for flat feet so I can wear sneakers I can't with these one",0.7122395634651184,"0.7708,0.7344,0.6927,0.6536"
8,AimeeMullins_2009U.sph.wav,and other things that i don't aren't familiar with and then one eight year old said hey why wouldn't you want to and the whole room including me was like yeah i went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as disabled to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn't have yet somebody that might even be super abled speaking to a group of about three hundred kids ages six to eight at a children 's museum and i brought with me a bag full of legs similar to the kinds of things you see up here and had them laid out on a table some of you actually saw me at ted eleven years ago and a lot of talk about how life changing this conference is for both speakers and attendees and i am no exception ted literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life 's exploration at the time the legs i presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics i had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah which you may have seen on stage yesterday and also these very life like intrinsically painted silicone legs so at the time it was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community to come bring their talent to the science and to the art of building legs so that we can stop compartmentalizing form function and aesthetic and assigning them different values well lucky for me a lot of people answered that call and the journey started funny enough with a ted conference attendee chee pearlman who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today she was the editor then of a magazine called id and she gave me a cover story on the design of the cheetah legs around the world people would come up to me after the conference after my talk men and women and the conversation would go something like this you're very attractive you don't look disabled i thought well that's amazing because i don't feel and it really opened my eyes to this conversation that could be explored about beauty what does a beautiful woman have to look like sexy body and interestingly from an identity standpoint what does it mean to have a disability the kids and from my experience you know kids are naturally curious about what they don't know or don't understand or what is foreign to them i mean people pamela anderson has more prosthetic in her body than i do nobody calls her disabled so this magazine through the hands of graphic designer peter saville went to fashion designer alexander mcqueen and photographer nick knight who were also interested in exploring that conversation so three months after ted i found myself on a plane to london doing my first fashion shoot which resulted in this cover fashion able three months after that i did my first runway show for alexander mcqueen on a pair of hand carved wooden legs made from solid ash nobody knew everyone thought they were wooden boots actually i have them on stage with me into something that invites them to look and look a little longer and maybe even understand i learned this firsthand with my next adventure the artist matthew barney in his film opus called the the cremaster cycle only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way and maybe censors that natural curiosity or you know reins in the question asking in the hopes of them being polite little kids this is where it really hit home for me that my legs could be wearable sculpture and even at this point i started to move away from the need to replicate human ness as the only aesthetic ideal so we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs even though they're actually optically clear polyurethane a k a bowling ball material heavy then we made these legs that are with a potato root system growing in them and beetroots out the top and a very lovely brass toe that's a good close up of that one then another character was a half woman half cheetah a little homage to my life as an athlete that whipped around like a gecko and then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these look like jellyfish legs also polyurethane and the only purpose that these legs can serve outside the context of the film is to so whimsy legs that various people have made for me and with them i have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet and i can change my height i have a variable of five different heights and she looked at me and she said but so i just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby with these unruly kids saying now whatever you do don't stare at her legs but as you want it and that's when i knew that's when i knew that the conversation with society has changed profoundly in this last decade it is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency it's a conversation about limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore it can stand as a symbol that the wearer has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space so people that society once considered to be can now become the architects of their own identities and indeed continue to change those identities by designing their bodies from a place of empowerment and what is exciting to me so much right now is that by combining cutting edge technology robotics bionics with the age old poetry that if we want to discover the full potential in our humanity we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths and those glorious disabilities that we all have i think of shakespeare 's shylock that's the point that's why i was there i wanted to invite them to look and explore so i made a deal with the adults that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes on their own the doors open if you prick us do we not bleed and if you tickle us do we not laugh it is our humanity and all the potential within it that makes us beautiful thank you the kids descend on this table of legs and they are poking and prodding and they're wiggling toes and they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that and i said kids really quickly i woke up this morning i decided i wanted to be able to jump over a house dream up right now what kind of legs would you build me and immediately a voice,1,I was speaking to a group of about 300 kids ages 6 to 8 at a children's museum and I brought with me a bag full of legs similar to the kinds of things you see up here and had them laid out in a table for the kids and for my experience your kids are naturally curious about what they don't know don't understand or is foreign to them they only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult's influences them to behave that way and maybe sensors that Natural Curiosity or your reins in the question asking for the in hopes of them being polite little kids so I'm acting up I just pictured of first grade teacher out in the lobby with these unruly kids say now whatever you do don't stare at her legs but that's the point that's why I was there I wanted to invite them to look and Explorer so I made a deal with the adults that the kids could come in without any adults for 2 minutes on their own the doors open the kids descend on this table of life. and they are poking and prodding and their wiggling toes and they're trying to put their full weight on this printing like to see what happens with that and I said kids really quickly I woke up this morning I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house nothing too big two or three stories but if you can think of any animal any superhero any cartoon character Anything You Can Dream up right now what kind of legs would you build me and immediately avoid shot at Kangaroo should be a frog No it should be go go gadget don't know what should be the Incredibles and other things and then 18 year olds head hey why wouldn't you want to fly to. and whole room including me was like yeah. and just like that I went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as disabled to somebody who had potential that their bodies didn't have yet some of that might even be super abled. interesting the some of you actually saw me a Ted 11 years ago and you know there's been a lot of talk about how life changing his conferences for both speakers and attendees and I am no exception had literally was a Launchpad to the next decade my life exploration at the time the leg that presented where groundbreaking and Prosthetics I had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs while after the Heimlich of a cheetah which you may have seen on stage yesterday and also these very lifelike intrinsically painted so complex. so at the time it was my opportunity to put a call out to the innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic Community to come bring their talent to the science and to the art of building legs that we can stop compartmentalizing form function and aesthetic and assigning them different values well lucky for me a lot of people answered that call and the journey started signing up with a Ted conference attendee cheap Ramen who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today she was the other than of a magazine called ID and she gave me a cover story this started and Incredible Journey curious encounters were happening at the time I've been accepting numerous invitations to speak on the design of the cheetah legs around the world and. people would come up to me after the conference after my talk men and women and the conversation would go something like this. you know I mean you're very attractive you don't look disabled. I thought wow that's amazing cuz I don't feel the table and it really opened my eyes to this conversation that could be explored about beauty what a beautiful woman have to look like a sexy body and interesting Lee from an identity standpoint what does it mean to have a disability I mean people Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic everybody than I do nobody calls her disabled. so this magazine through the hands of graphic designer Peter saddle went to Fashion Designer Alexander McQueen and photographer Nick Knight who were also interested in exploring that conversation the three months after Ted I found myself on a plane to London doing my first fashion shoot resulted in this cover fashion able three months after that I did my first runway show for Alexander McQueen on a pair of hand-carved wooden legs made from solid Ash nobody knew everyone thought they were wouldn't boots I said I have them on stage with me. grapevines Magnolia is truly stunning. poetry matters. poetry's what elevates the banal and neglected object to a realm of art it can transform the thing that might have. made people fearful into something that invites them to look and look a little longer and maybe even understand. I learned this firsthand with my next venture the artist Matthew Barney and his film Opus called the cream Master cycle. this is where it really hit home for me that my legs to be wearable sculpture and even at this point I started to move away from the need to replicate human this as the only aesthetic ideal so we made with people lovingly refer to his last legs even though they're actually optically clear polyurethane AKA bowling ball material that we made these like the forecast in soil with a potato root system going in them in beet Roots out the top and I'm very lovely brastow so I could post some of that one then another character was a half woman half cheetah little to wash to my life as an athlete 14 hours a prosthetic makeup to get into a creature that had articulated Paws Claws and a tail that whipped around. like a gecko and then another pair of legs we collaborated on with these look like jellyfish lay eggs also polyurethane and the only purpose of these legs cancer about said the context of the film is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination. The Whimsy matters. today I have over a dozen pair a prosthetic leg that very simple have made for me and with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet and I can change my height I have a variable of five different Heights today I'm 61. and I have these legs made a little over a year ago and it at Dorsett or the Pedic in England when I brought them home to Manhattan my first night out on the town with a very fancy party and a girl was there who has known me for years at my normal 58 her mouth dropped open when she told me it's still talk. and I thought I know isn't it fun I mean I know it's a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts but I have an entirely new relationship the door jambs that I never expected I would ever have and I'm having fun with that. and she looked at me and she said but Amy that's not fair. I'm incredible thing was she really meant to say it's not fair that you can change your height as you want it and that's when I knew that's when I knew that the conversation with Society has changed profoundly in this last decade it is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency it's a conversation about augmentation it's a conversation about potential a prosthetic limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore it can stand as a symbol that the wearer has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space so people that Society once considered to be disabled. can now become the architects of their own identities and indeed continue to change those identities. by designing their bodies from a place of empowerment. and what is exciting to me so much right now is that by combining cutting-edge technology robotic bionics with the age-old poetry. we are moving closer to understanding our Collective Humanity. I think that if we want to discover the full potential and our Humanity. we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths and those glorious disabilities that we all have I think of Shakespeare Shylock. if you prick us do we not bleed. and if you tickle us do we not laugh. it is our Humanity. and all the potential within it that makes us beautiful thank you,0.7057291269302368,"0.6328,0.7474,0.7318,0.7786"
9,AlGore_2006.sph.wav,i looked in the rearview mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me there was no motorcade back there you've heard of phantom limb pain this was a rented ford taurus she took our order and then went to the couple in the booth next to us and she lowered her a series of the very next day but what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services the story began former vice president al gore announced in nigeria yesterday my wife tipper and i have opened a low cost family shoney 's and we are running it ourselves tipper was saying one more burger with fries talk about on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on what can you do about the climate crisis i want to start with show some new images and i'm going to recapitulate just four or five now the slide show i update the slide show every time i give it i add new images because i learn more about it every time i give it it's like beachcombing you know every time the tide comes in and out you find some more shells and i say that sincerely partly because just in the last two days we got the new temperature records in january this is just for the united states of america historical average for january is thirty one degrees last month was thirty nine point five degrees now i know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment but these are the recapitulation slides and then i'm going to go into new material about what you can do but i wanted to elaborate on a couple of these first of all this is where we're projected to go with the u s contribution to global warming under business as usual need that a cost it's a profit the sign is wrong it's not negative it's positive these are investments that pay for themselves but they are also very effective in deflecting our path cars and trucks i talked about that in the slideshow but i want you to put it in perspective it's an easy visible target of concern and it should be but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks cars and trucks are very significant and we have the lowest standards in the world and so we should address that but it's part of the puzzle other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks shows it carbon capture and sequestration that's what ccs stands for is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe not quite there yet ok now what can you do reduce emissions in your home most of these expenditures are also profitable a hybrid use light rail figure out some of the other options that are much better it's important be a green consumer you have choices with everything you buy between things that have a harsh effect or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis consider this make a decision to live a carbon neutral life those of you who are good at branding i'd love to get your advice and help i flew on air force two for eight years on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people it is easier than you think it really is a lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy reduce your carbon and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced and what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis net there is a carbon calculator now i have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane on this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a consumer friendly carbon calculator you can very precisely calculate what your co two emissions are and then you will be given options to reduce and by the time the movie comes out in may this will be updated to two point zero and we will have click through purchases of offsets next consider making your business carbon neutral again some of us have done that and it's not as hard as you think community invest sustainably majora mentioned this listen if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance don't ever again complain about quarterly report ceo it talk about it the movie comes out the movie is a movie version of the slideshow i gave two nights ago except it's a lot more and it comes out in may many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it consider sending somebody to nashville pick well and i am personally going to train people to give this slideshow re purposed with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach and it's not just the slides it's what they mean and it's how they link together and so i'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse in communities all across the country and we're what that's been like for me use copyrights so that young people can remix it we need republicans as well this used to be a bipartisan issue and i know that in this group it really is become politically active make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work it's a true story every bit of this is true support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions global warming pollution and trading as long as the united states is out of the world system it's not a closed system once it becomes a closed system it's a closed system soon after tipper and i left the you will have legal liability if you do not urge your ceo to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided the market will work to solve this problem if we can accomplish this and in our modern country the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once let 's rebrand global warming as many of you have suggested i like climate crisis instead of climate collapse but again those of you who are good at branding i need your help on this that's really true you very,1,"thank you so much Chris and it's it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to the stage twice I'm extremely grateful I have been blown away by this conference and I want to thank all of you for the the many nice comments about what I had to say the the other night Hannah and I say that sincerely. partly because I need that. put yourselves in my position. I flew on Air Force 2 for 8 years. no I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane. I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me. is it true story every bit of this is true. soon after different I left the White House. we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have fifty miles east of Nashville. ourselves. to you but. I looked in the rearview mirror and. all of a sudden it just hit me yet there was no motorcade back there. you've heard of phantom limb pain. this. this was a rented Ford Taurus. it was dinner time and we started looking for a place to eat we are on I-40 we got to exit 238 Lebanon Tennessee we got off the exit are look what we found a Shoney's restaurant low-cost family restaurant chain for those who don't know it. we went in and sat down at the booze and the waitress came over made a big commotion over Tipper. she took our order and then went to the couple in the booth next to us and she lowered her voice so much I do really strange to hear what you were saying and she said yes that's former vice president Al Gore and his wife Tipper and the man said he's come down a long way and. there's been kind of a series of epiphanies. the very next day continuing the totally true story I got on a G5 to fly to Africa to make a speech and Nigeria in the city of Lagos on the topic of energy and I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville and I told him pretty much the same way I just shared it with you tip an hour driving ourselves Shoney's low-cost family restaurant chain with the man said they laughed I gave my speech then went back out to the airport to fly back home I fell asleep on the plane until during the middle of the night we landed on the Azores Islands for refilling I woke up they open the door I went out to get some fresh air and I looked and there was a man running across the runway. and he was waving a piece of paper and he was yelling call Washington call Washington. and I thought to myself the middle of the night middle of the Atlantic what in the world could be wrong and washing then I remembered it could be a bunch of things. 10. but what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America Sprint in Monterey I checked. all in the story began former vice president Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday quote my wife took her and I have opened a low-cost Family Restaurant. can I show knees and we are running it ourselves. before I could get back to you as so I'll David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on one of them had me in a big white chef's hat Tipper was saying one more burger with fries 3 days later I got a nice long handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton sink out. we like to celebrate each other's successes in life. call Jenna talk about information ecology but I was thinking that since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to Ted that maybe I could talk about that another time. I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on what can you do about the climate crisis I want to start with a couple of I'm going to show some new images and I'm going to recapitulate. just 450 slideshow every time I give it I add new images because I learned more about it every time I get a life like beachcombing you know every time the tide comes in and out you find some more shelves just in the last two days we got the new temperature records in January this is just for the United States of America starkel average for January is 31° last month was 39.5 degrees now I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment I'm kidding. but these are the recapitulation slides and then I'm going to go into a new material about what you can do but I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these the first of all this is where we're projected to go with the US contribution to global warming under business as usual efficiency in in Juice electricity and in use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit deficiency in conservation it's not a cost it's a profit the sign is wrong it's not negative it's positive these are investments that pay for themselves but they are also very effective in deflecting our path. cars and trucks I talked about that in the slideshow but I want you to put it in perspective it's an easy visible Target of concern and it should be but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings then from cars and trucks cars and trucks are very significant and we have the lowest standards in the world and so we should address that but it's part of the puzzle other transportation is efficiency is as important as cars and trucks Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference and with what does the note and some in the drawer and others many of you here a lot of people directly involved in this this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it. carbon capture and sequestration that's what CCS stands for it is likely to become the killer app. that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe. not quite there yet okay. what can you do. reduce emissions in your home. most of these expenditures are all so profitable insulation better design by Green electricity where where you can. I mentioned automobiles. buy a hybrid use light rail. figure out some of the other options that are much better it's important. be a green consumer you have choices with everything you by between things that have a harsh effect or a much less harsh effect on the on the global climate crisis consider this make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life those of you who are good at branding I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people it is easier than you think it really is a lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy it means it means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced and what. it means is elaborated at climate crisis. Net there is a carbon calculator. are participant Productions convened with my active involvement of the leading software writers in the world on this Arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator you can you can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are and then you will be given options to reduce and in by the time the movie comes out in May this will be updated to 2.0 and we will have click-through purchases of offsets next consider making your business carbon-neutral again some of us have done that and it's not as hard as you think. integrate climate Solutions into all of your Innovations whether you are from the technology or entertainment or design and architecture Community invest sustainably Majora mentioned this listen if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance do never again complain about quarterly report CEO management. overtime people do what you pay them to do. and if they judge how much they're going to get paid on your based on the short-term returns you're going to get short-term decisions. lot more to be said about that become a catalyst of change teach others learn about it talk about it. the movie comes out the movie to save movie version of the slideshow that I gave two nights ago except it's a lot more entertaining. and it comes out in May many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it. consider sending somebody to Nashville Pickwell. and I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow repurposed with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach and it's it's not just a slight it's what they mean and it's how they linked together and so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it in mass and communities all across the country and we're going to update the slide show for all of them every single week to keep it right on the Cutting Edge working with Larry lessig if it will be at somewhere in that process posted with tools and limited use copyrights so that young people can remix it all and use it in and do it in their own way. where did anybody get the idea that you want to stay arm's length from politics it doesn't mean that I'm trying to convince if you were Republican that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat we need Republicans as well it just thought you used to be a bipartisan issue Anna and I know that in this group it really is become politically active make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions global warming pollution and trading and here's why. as long as the United States is out of the world system it's not a closed system once it becomes a closed system with us participation then everybody who's on a board of directors how many people here serves serve on the board of directors of a corporation. once it's a closed system you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided the market will work to solve this problem. if if we can accomplish this. help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring with a change the minds of the American people because presently the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be to be done and in our modern country the role of logic and reason no long no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did it's now repetition of short hot-button 30-second 28-second television ads with the buy a lot of those ads. what's Rebrand global warming. as many of you have suggested I like climate crisis instead of climate collapse but again those of you who are good at branding I need your help on this. somebody said the test we're facing now a scientist told me is whether the combination of an opposable thumb in the neocortex is a viable combination. if that's really true. I said the other night and I know. repeat now this is not a political issue again the Republicans here. the shouldn't be part of him you have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do this is an opportunity that just this but connected to the ideas that are here to bring more coherence to them. we are one thank you very much I appreciate it. traffic is a global epidemic traffic is creating 45% of the world's pollution in the UK time wasted in traffic cost 20 billion a year would you place a clean around the Falls to commute Stockholm put it to a vote vote vote is for it. how to do something install come to improve the environment to end to get to better flow in the traffic will put a price on taking your car to the central post off, and we called that congestion charges. if your self assistant assistant doesn't work on the first day then you will be in big trouble it must be perfect from Davon. they're eating a gates to the city each is equipped with cameras pictures of taking out the rear and front license plates these pictures are sent to Central system that identifies the license plates and make sure that the right person pays for the right passages are the optical character reading of the license plate we went out IBM's Global organization and the R&D centres and find a very good software we could use a way to manage p.m. to Majid in two months time going to 9% of old pictures are correctly identified. Northside this is how it should be all the time you need to see the traffic of the truck is 6 p.m. before we have the congestion charge in the traffic was chewing up at this time of day it is I think it's a good idea because I think that we should take care of the environment in the CD is about 40% better it is huge International interest from different parts of the world from the United States from Latin America from China and its really pretty sure to tell people no problem. Planning to do what we're actually have done install come she is not thinking like me for. I'm thinking for the children and their grandchildren",0.69140625,"0.6823,0.7057,0.6354,0.7005"
10,AlGore_2008.sph.wav,heard a couple of days ago about the value of have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choice figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted by the amazing experience that she was going through we now have a culture of distraction but we have a planetary emergency and we have to find a way to create in the generation of those alive today a sense of generational mission i wish i could find the words to convey this this was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet another that ended slavery we can do this on our house and dug the geothermal wells and did all of that have the capacity at moments of great challenge to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge that history is presenting to us other stuff sometimes i hear people by saying oh this is so terrible what a burden we have i would like to ask you to re frame that but as important as it is to change the light bulbs it is more important to change the laws and when we had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts challenge that can pull from us more than we knew we could do i think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gratitude that we are the generation about which a thousand years from now and poets and singers will celebrate by saying they were the ones so many people at ted there is deep pain that basically a design issue at the end of the day a design issue on a voting form one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being heard like that in the last eight years in a position where you could make these things come true you have no idea when you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now i mean are you excited by their plans on global the answer to the question is hard for me because on the one hand i think that we should feel really great about the fact that the and forward leaning position on the climate crisis all three have offered leadership and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration in order and i think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals to be optimistic about this we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy in the campaign dialogue that as illustrated by the questions that was put together by the league of conservation voters by the way the analysis of all the questions and by the way the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the orwellian label clean coal every single debate has been sponsored by clean coal now even lower emissions the richness and fullness of the dialogue in our democracy has not laid the basis for the kind of bold that is really needed so they're saying the right things and they may whichever of them is elected may do the right thing but let me tell you only one out of one hundred senators was willing to vote to confirm to ratify that treaty whatever the candidates say has to be laid alongside what the people say this challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization co two is the exhaling breath of our civilization literally and now we mechanized that process changing that pattern requires a scope a scale a speed of change that is beyond what we have done in the past so that's why i began by saying be optimistic in what you do but be an active citizen demand change the light bulbs but change the laws change the global treaties we have to speak up we have to solve this democracy this we have sclerosis in our democracy and we have to change that use the internet go on the internet connect with people become very active as citizens have a moratorium we shouldn 't have any new we have to quickly build these renewable sources now nobody is talking on that scale but i do believe that between now and november it is possible this alliance for climate protection launch a nationwide campaign grassroots mobilization television ads internet ads radio newspaper with partnerships with everybody from the girl scouts to the hunters and fishermen we need help your own personal role going forward al is there something more than that you would like to be doing i have prayed that would be able to find the answer it does depend on all of us but again not just with the light bulbs most of us here are americans we have a democracy we can change things but we have to actively change i have given what's needed really is a higher level of consciousness and that's hard to that's hard to create but it is coming if you want to go far go together we have to go far thank you so much for coming to ted the slide show that i gave here two years ago about two thousand times i'm giving a short slide show this morning that i'm giving for the very first time many years ago when i was a young congressman i spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control the nuclear arms race and the military historians taught me during that quest that military conflicts are typically put into three categories local battles regional or theater wars and the rare but all important global world war a different organizational model environmental challenges fall into the same three categories and most of what we think about are local environmental problems air pollution water pollution hazardous waste dumps but there are also regional environmental problems like acid rain from the midwest to the northeast and from western europe to the arctic and not because venus is slightly closer to the sun it's three times hotter than mercury which is right next to the you've seen this slide before but there's a change the only two countries that didn't ratify and now there's only one,1,I have given the slideshow that that I gave here two years ago about two thousand times I'm giving a short slide show this morning that I'm giving for the very first time so it well it's I don't I don't want to raise the bar I'm actually trying to lower the table this together to try to to meet the the challenge of this session and I was reminded by Karen Armstrong's fantastic presentation that it is from religion really properly understood is not about believe but about Behavior. perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism. how dare we be optimistic. optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief. an intellectual posture was Mahatma Gandhi famously is said you must become the change you wish to see in the world and the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created by the belief alone except to the extent that the belief. brings about new Behavior. but the weird Behavior it is also I think sometimes misunderstood in this context I'm a big advocate of changing the light bulbs and buying hybrid send Tipper 9 ft 33 solar panels on our house and Doug the geothermal Wells and done all of that other stuff but the light bulbs it's more important to change the laws and when we change our behavior in our in our daily lives we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the Democracy part. in order to be optimistic about this we have to become incredibly active as Citizens in our democracy in order to solve the climate crisis we have to solve the Democracy crisis and we and we have one. I have been trying to tell the story for a long time I was reminded of that recently by a woman who walked past the table I was sitting at just staring at me if she walked out she was in her 70s looked like she had a kind face. I thought nothing of it until I saw from the corner of my eye she was walking from the opposite direction also just staring at me until I said how do you do and she said you know you dyed your hair black you would look just like Al Gore. many years ago when I was a young congressman and I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control the nuclear arms race and the military historians taught me during that Quest. that military conflicts are typically put into three categories local battles. Regional or theater Wars and the rarebit all-important global World War strategic conflicts and he requires a different allocation of resources a different approach a different organizational model environmental challenges fall into the same three categories and most of what we think about our local environmental problems air pollution water pollution hazardous waste dumps but there are also Regional environmental problems like acid rain from the Midwest to the Northeast in from Western Europe to the Artic and from the Midwest out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico and their lots of those but the climate crisis is the rare but all important Global or strategic. conflict everything is affected and we have to organize our response appropriately we need a worldwide Global mobilization for renewable energy conservation efficiency and a global transition to a low-carbon economy we have work to do. and we can mobilize resources and political will. but the political will have to be mobilized in order to mobilize the resources. let me show you these slides here I thought I would start with the logo. what's missing here of course is the north polar ice cap. Greenland remains. 28 years ago. this is what the polar ice cap in the north polar ice cap look like at the end of the summer at the fall equinox this last fall I went to the snow and ice Data Center in Boulder Colorado and talk to the researchers here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate laboratory this is what's happened in the last 28 years. to put it in perspective. 2005 was the previous record here's what happened last fall that has really. unnerve the researchers. the north polar ice cap is the same size geographically doesn't look that quite the same size but it is exactly the same size as the United States minus an area roughly equal to the State of Arizona the amount that disappeared in 2005 was equivalent to everything east of the Mississippi. the extra amount that disappeared last fall. what's equivalent to this much comes back in the in the winter but not as permanent ice is thin ice vulnerable. the amount remaining. could be completely gone and summer in as little as five years. that puts a lot of pressure on Greenland. already around the Arctic Circle. this is a famous Village in Alaska this is a town in Newfoundland. Antarctica. latest studies from NASA the amount of a moderate to severe snow melting of an area equivalent. to the size of California. they were the best of times it was the worst of times. the most famous opening sentence in English literature I want to share briefly a tale of two planets Earth and Venus are exactly the same size. Earth's diameter is about 400 km larger but. essentially the same size they are exactly the same amount of carbon. but the difference is on Earth most of the carbon has been leached overtime out of the atmosphere deposited in the ground as coal oil natural gas Etc on Venus most of it is in the atmosphere. the difference is that our temperature is 59 degrees on average on Venus it's 855 this is relevant to our current strategy of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible and putting it into the atmosphere it's not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun is 3 times hotter than Mercury which is right next to the Sun. briefly here's an image you've seen as one of the only old images but I show it because I want to briefly give ucsi climate. the global scientific Community says man-made global warming pollution put into the atmosphere thickening this is trapping more of the outgoing infrared you all know that at the last ipcc summary the scientist wanted to say how certain are you they wanted to answer that 99% of the Chinese objected and so the compromise was more than 90%. now the Skeptics say I'll wait a minute this could be variations in the in this energy coming in from the Sun if that were true the stratosphere would be heated as well as the lower atmosphere. if it's more coming in if it's more being trapped on the way out then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler here. here is the Allure atmosphere here is the stratosphere cooler Casi climate. now here's the good news. 68% of Americans now believe that human activity is responsible for global warming. 69% believe that the Earth is heating up in a significant way there has been progress but. here is the key. when given a list of challenges to confront. global warming is still listed at near the bottom. what is missing is a sense of urgency. if you if you agree with the factual analysis but you don't feel the sense of urgency where does that leave you with the alliance for climate protection which I had in conjunction with the current TV who did this pro bono didn't a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this this was the winter.NBC I'll show all of the Network's hear the top journalist friend BC as 956 questions in 2007 of the presidential candidates to worry about the climate crisis. ABC 844 questions to about the climate crisis. Fox 2. CNN to. CBS 0. from last two laps to tear this is one of the old tobacco commercials. so here is what we're doing this is gasoline consumption in all of these countries. and us. but it's not just the developed Nations. the developing countries are now following us and accelerating their pace and actually their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent of where we were in 1965 and they're catching up very dramatically the total concentrations by 2025 they will be essentially where where we were in 1985. the wealthy countries were completely missing from the picture we would still have this crisis but we have given to the developing countries the Technologies and the ways of thinking. that are creating the crisis this is in Bolivia over 20 over 30 years. this is peak fishing in a few seconds the 60s. 70s 80s. 90s. we have to stop this and the good news is that we can we have the Technologies we have to have a unified view of how to go about this the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions Paul has a single very simple solution he was a what's the solution. Puritas put a price on carbon. we need a CO2 tax revenue neutral to replace. to replace taxation on employment which was invented by Bismarck and some things have changed since the 19th century. in the poor world we have to integrate the responses to Poverty with the solutions to The Climate crisis plans to fight poverty in Uganda. are muted if we do not solve the climate crisis. but responses can. actually make a huge difference in the poor countries. this is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in Europe that this was from nature magazine these are concentrating solar renewable energy plants linked in a so-called supergrid to supply all of the electrical power to Europe largely from developing countries high voltage or DC current this is not pie-in-the-sky this can be done. we need to do it for our own economy the latest figures show that the old model is not working there are a lot of great Investments that you can make if you are investing in tar Sands or Shell Oil then you have a portfolio that is crammed with sub-prime carbon assets. and it is based on an old model junkies find veins in their toes when the ones in their arms and their legs collapse. developing tar Sands and coal Shale is the equivalent here are just a few of the Investments that I personally think make sense I have a stake in these so I'll have the disclaimer there but geothermal concentrating solar Advanced stub photovoltaics efficiency and conservation you've seen its like before but there's a change. the only two countries that didn't ratify now there's only one. Australia had an election. and there was a campaign in Australia that involves television and Internet and radio commercials to lift the sense of urgency for the people there and we trained 250 people to give the slideshow in every town and Village and city in Australia lot of other things contributed to it but the new prime minister announced that his very first priority would be to change Australia's position on Kyoto and he has out they came to an awareness partly because of the horrible drought that they have had. this is why clinere. my friend Heidi called and said that if we gave droughts and names the way we give Hurricanes names we would call the one in the Southeast now Katrina and we would say it's headed toward Atlanta. we can't wait for the kind of drought Australia had to change our political culture. here's more good news the city supporting Kyoto in the US are up to 780 and I thought I saw one go by there. just to localize this. which is good news now. the clothes. we heard a couple of days ago about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace that it becomes banala routine. What We Need is Another Hero generation. we those of us who are alive in the United States of America today especially but also the rest of the world have to somehow understand. that history has presented us with a choice. this is Jill Taylor. I was figuring out how to save her life. while she was distracted by the amazing experience that she was going through we now have a culture of distraction. but we have a planetary emergency. can we have to find a way to create in the generation of those alive today a sense of generational Mission I wish I could find the words to convey this. this was another hero generation. that brought democracy to the planet. another that ended slavery. and the gave women the right to vote. we can do this don't tell me that we don't have the capacity to do it if we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the Iraq War we could be well on the way to solving this challenge we have the capacity to do it. one final point. I'm optimistic. because I believe we have the capacity. at moments of great challenge to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge that history is presenting to us. sometimes I hear people respond to the. disturbing facts of the climate crisis. by saying all this is so terrible. what a burden we have. I would like to ask you to refrain that. how many generations in all of human history. have had the opportunity. to rise to a challenge. that is worthy of our best efforts. that has a challenge that can pull from us. more than we knew we could do. I think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gratitude. that we are the generation. about which a thousand years from now. Philharmonic orchestras. and Poets and singers. will celebrate by saying they were the ones. that sounded within themselves. to solve this crisis and lay the basis for a bright and optimistic human future. let's do that thank you very much. but so many people out in that Ted there is there is deep pain that they sent me a design issue at the end of the day a design issue on a voting for him one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being her like that and then I'll stay is in a position where you could make these things come true.. When you look at what the leading candidates in your own party at doing now I'm in does those are you excited by the plans on global warming. the answer is the answer the question is it is it is hard for me because. on the one hand I think that we should feel really great about the fact that the the Republican nominee certain nominee John McCain and both of the finalists for the Democratic nomination all three have a very different and forward-leaning position on the climate crisis all three have offered leadership very different from the approach taken by the current Administration and I think that is that all three have also been responsible and putting forward plans and proposals. but. the the the campaign dialogue that as illustrated by the questions that was put together by the league of conservation voters by the way the analysis of all the questions and by the way the debates have all been sponsored by something was it goes by the orwellian label Clean Coal. have you as anybody noticed that every single debates been sponsored by Clean Cove now even lower emissions. the richness and fullness of the fullness of the dialogue in our democracy has not laid the basis for the kind of bold initiative that is really needed so they're saying the right things and they may whichever of them is elected may do the right thing but let me tell you when I came back from Kyoto in 1997 with with feel it with a feeling of great happiness that we've gotten that break through there and then confronted the United States Senate only one out of 100 Senators was willing to vote to confirm took to ratify the treaty whatever the candidates say. has to be laid alongside what the people say. this challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization CO2 is the exhaling breath of our civilization literally and now we mechanize that process change that pattern requires a scope a scale a speed of change that it is beyond what we have done in the past so that's why I begin by saying. be optimistic in what you do but be an active citizen demand change the light bulbs but change the laws change the the global treaty we have to speak up we have to solve this this democracy. this is it this week we have sclerosis in our democracy and we have to change that use the internet go on the Internet connect with people become very active as citizens have a moratorium on it we shouldn't have any new coal-fired generating plants that aren't able to capture and store CO2 which means we have to quickly build these renewable source. Nobody is talking on that scale but I do believe that between now and November it is possible this Alliance for climate protection. is going to launch a nationwide campaign Grassroots mobilization television as Internet ads radio newspaper with Partnerships with everybody from The Girls Scouts to the hunters and fishermen we need help we need help. and intensity around Pest Control going forward is there something more that you would like to be doing I have prayed that I. would be able to find the answer to that question what can I do but Mr Fuller wants wrote If the future of all human civilization depended on me. what would I do how would I be it does depend on all of us but again not just with the light bulbs. we most of us here are Americans. we have a democracy we can change things but we have to actively change what's needed really is a higher level of consciousness. and that's hard to that's hard to create but it is coming there's an old African proverb that some of you know that says if you want to go quickly go alone. if you want to go far go together. we have to go far quickly. so we have to have a change in Consciousness a changing commitment a new sense of urgency a new appreciation for the privilege that we have undertaken this challenge thank you so much for coming. thank you very much,0.7213541865348816,"0.6901,0.6198,0.5807,,0.7526"
11,AlSeckel_2004.sph.wav,these are real objects now i'm going to show you how it is done i've looped the film here so you can get a very interesting experience i want you to see how this illusion is constructed and it's going to rotate so you see that it's inside out now watch as it rotates back how quickly your perception snaps talk my a new lecture just for ted and i'm going show you some illusions that we've created for ted and i'm going to try to relate this to happiness ok now watch it as it rotates back again and this is a very bright audience all right see if you can stop it from happening even though you know one hundred percent it's true that you we're going to do it again no doubt about see if you can stop it from happening it's difficult and we can violate your in a whole variety of ways about representation about shape about color and so forth and it's very primal and it's an interesting question to ponder why these things we find these things joyful why would we find them joyful so here 's something that lionel did a while ago i like these sort of little things like this i was thinking about with happiness is what gives happiness or happiness which i equate with joy in my particular area and i think there's something very fundamental and i was thinking about this ok we can violate your expectations about shape we can violate your expectations on representation what an image represents what do you see here see dolphins ok those people who raised their hands afterwards the rest of the audience go talk to them all right actually this is the best example of priming by experience that i know if you are a child under the age of ten who haven't been ruined yet look at this image and see dolphins now some of you adults here are saying dolphins what dolphins but in fact if you figure ground in other words the dark areas here i forgot to ask for a pointer but if you reverse it you'll see a whole series of little dolphins by the way it's something like this can be because this is after all talk about design this is done by saatchi and saatchi and they actually got away with this ad in australia so if you look at this ad for beer all those people are in sort of provocative positions but they got it past and actually won the clio awards so it is funny to do these things this is the joke i did when the the florida ballot was going around you know count the dots for gore count the dots for bush count them again and it's in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that you can violate your expectations about experience here is this is something we're building for you know amusement parks and that kind of stuff now let 's take a static image can you see this do you see the middle section moving down and the outer sections moving up it's completely static a static image how many people see it's completely static right now when it's interesting that when we look at an image we see you know color depth texture and you can look at this whole scene and analyze it you can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth but the whole thing is actually flat and it was such a good trompe l 'oeil that people got irritated when they tried to talk to the woman and she wouldn't respond now you can make design mistakes like this building in new york so that when you see it from this side it looks like the balconies tilt up and when you walk around to the other side it looks like the balconies go down so there are cases where you have mistakes in design that incorporate illusions or you take this particular un retouched now interestingly enough i get a lot of emails from people who say is there any perceptual difference between males and females and i really say no i mean women can navigate through the world just as well as males can and why however this is one illusion that women can consistently do better than males in matching which head because they rely on fashion cues they can match the now getting to a part i want to show design in illusions i believe that the first example of illusions being used purposely was by da vinci in this anamorphic image of so that when you saw from one little angle was like this and this little technique got popular in the sixteenth century and the seventeenth century to disguise hidden meanings where you could flip the image like this but these are early incorporations of illusions brought to sort of hot point with hans holbein 's ambassadors and hans holbein worked for henry this was hung on a wall where you could walk down from the stair and you can see this hidden skull right now i'm going to show you some designers who with illusions to give that element of surprise one of my favorites is scott kim i worked with scott to create some illusions for ted i hope you will enjoy we have one here ted and happiness so we scott created this wonderful well there's analog and digital figure goes to ground and for the musicians and of course since happiness we want joy to the world now another great designer he 's very well known in japan and he just builds some fantastic things this is simply amazing this is a pile of junk so what i'm going to try and do in my lecture is a go a little bit further and see that when you view it from one particular angle you see its reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano to violinist this is really wild this assemblage of forks knives and spoons and various cutlery welded together can violate your expectations in a pleasing way i mean sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant but i'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way in a very primal way so i can make the audience here happy a shadow of a motorcycle you learn something in the sort of thing that i do which is there are people out there with a lot of time on their hands ken knowlton does wonderful composite images like creating jacques cousteau out of seashells un retouched seashells but just by rearranging them he did einstein out of dice because after all einstein said god does not play dice with the universe out of un retouched keyboards will shortz crossword puzzle john cederquist does these wonderful trompe i'm going to skip ahead since i'm sort of running i want to show you quickly what i've created some new type of illusions i've done something with taking the pixar type illusions so you see these kids the same size here running down the hall the two table tops of the same size they're looking out two directions at once you have a larger piece fitting in with a smaller and that's something for you to think about all right so you see larger pieces fitting in within smaller pieces here you can see the two kids are looking out simultaneously out of two different directions at once now can you believe these two table tops are the same size and shape they are so if you measured them they would be as i say those two figures are identical in size and shape interesting by doing so i'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations first of all i want to show you the particular illusion here this in this sort of rendered fashion how much stronger these illusions are any case i hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness and if you're interested in seeing more cool effects see me outside i'd be happy to show you i want you first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other,1,we're going to talk about my a new lecture just for Ted and I'm going to show you some illusions that we've created for Ted and I know trying to relate this to happiness and what I was thinking about with happiness is what gives happiness or happiness which I equate with joy in my particular area and I think there's something very fundamental and I was thinking about this and it's in terms of both illusion and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that there's something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing way you go see a movie and has an unexpected twist something that you didn't expect and you find a joyful experience you look at the sort of allusions in my book and it's not as what you'd expect and there's something joyful about it and it's the same thing with jokes and and all these sort of thing so I'm going to try and do in my lectures go a little bit further and see if I. violate your expectations in a pleasing way I mean sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant but I'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way in a very Primal way so I can make the audience here happy so I'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations principal I want to show you the particular illusion here I want you to first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other these are all perceptual tricks these are real objects that I'm going to show you. now I'm going to show you how is done I've Loop the film here so you can get a very interesting experience I want you to see how this Illusions construction and it's going to rotate so you see that it's an inside-out thing now watch as it rotates back how quickly your perception snaps. okay now watch it as we rotates back again and it's a very bright audience all right see if you can stop it from happening even though you know a hundred percent is true that you can't undo it. what does that tell you about yourself we're going to do it again no doubt about it see if you can stop it from happening. I know it's difficult. we can violate your expectations in a whole variety of ways about representation about shapes about color and so forth and is very Primal it's interesting question to ponder why these things. we find these things joyful why would we find that joyful so here's something that Lionel did awhile ago I like these sort of little things like this. again this is not an obstacle to Rick this is this is what you would see. no worries it's not a camera it's a perceptual trip. okay we can violate your expectations about shape. how does that work. we can violate your expectations on representation what an image represents what do you see here. how many of you here see dolphins. raise your hand if you see dolphins okay those people who raise their hands afterwards the rest of the audience go talk to them all right actually this is the best example of a priming spy experience that I know if you are a child under the age of 10 who haven't been ruined yet. you will look at this image and see dolphins now some of you adults hear a thing areas here I forgot to ask for a pointer but if you reverse you'll see a whole series of little Dolphins by the way of your also student at Caltech they tend also see to just see the dolphins is it's it's is based on experience. something like this can be used cuz this is after all the talk about design to this was done by Saatchi & Saatchi and they actually got away with this app in Australia so if you look at this for beer all those people are in sort of provocative positions but they got it passed and actually won the Clio Awards so it is funny how you can do these things remember that sort of. this is a joke I did all right when the Florida ballot was going around you know count the dots for Gore count the gods Forbush count them again. you can violate your expectations about experience here is a. an outside water fountain that I created with some friends of mine but you can stop the water and drops and then actually make all the drops. levitate. this is something that were building for you know musement parks in that kind of stuff now let's take a static image can you see this do you see the middle section moving down in the outer sections moving up is completely static. the static image desert how many people see this illusion. is completely static. all right now when it's interesting that when we look at an image we see you know color depth texture. and you can look at this whole scene in analyzing you can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth but the whole thing is actually flat it's painted it's trumploid and it was such a good trumploid the people got irritated when they try to talk to the woman and she wouldn't respond. you can make design mistakes. like this building in New York so that when you. see it from this side it looks like the balconies tilt-up and when you walk around to the other side look looks like the balconies. go down so there are cases where you have mistakes and design then incorporate Illusions or you take this particular unretouched photograph. interestingly enough I get a lot of emails from people who say is there any perception difference between males and females and I really say no I mean women can navigate to the world just as well as males can't why wouldn't they however this is the one illusion that women can consistently do better than males in matching witch head because they rely on fashion cues they can match the Hat. now getting to a part I want to show design in Illusions I believe that the first example of allusions being used purposely was by DaVinci in this anamorphic image of an eye. so that when you saw it from one angle was like this and this little technique up popular in the 16th century the 17th century to the skies hidden meanings where you could flip the image and see it from one little point of view like this for these are early and corporations of Illusions brought to its sort of Hotpoint with hands holbein's the ambassador's by hands Holbein work for Henry the 8th this was hung on a wall where you walk down from the steering you could see this hidden skull. right now I'm going to show you some designers who work with allusions to give that element of surprise one of my favorite is Scott Kim I work with Scott to create some Illusions for Ted. that I hope you will enjoy we have one here on Ted and happiness. okay now Arthur hasn't talked yet but his is going to be a delightful talk and he has some of his really fantastic machines outside and so we can us God created this wonderful. tribute to Arthur Ganson. well there's analog and digital. but that was appropriate here. and figure goes to ground. and for the musicians. and of course since happiness we want Joy to the World. now another great designer he's very well known in Japan xikeo fukuda all right and he just spilled some fantastic things but this is simply amazing. this is a pile of junk. that when you view it from one particular angle. you see its reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano. pianist. transforms to a violinist. this is really wild. this is a semblance of forks knives and spoons and berries Cutlery welded together. I'm going to Shadow the motorcycle. you learn something in the sort of thing that I do which is there people out there with a lot of time on their hands. Ken Melton does wonderful composite images. by creating Jacques Cousteau out of seashells unretouched seashells but just by rearranging them he did Einstein out of dice cuz after all I'm Stein said God does not play dice with the universe bird hertzog out-of-touch keyboards will shortz crossword puzzle. John cederquist does he's wonderful employee. cabins I'm going to skip ahead cuz I'm sort of running ahead I want to show you quickly what I've created some new type of Illusions I've done something with taking the Pixar type Illusions so you see these kids they're the same size here. running down the hall the two table tops of the same size they're looking out two directions at once you have a larger piece filling in with and smaller. and that's something for you to think about all right so you see larger pieces fitting in with in smaller pieces here. does everyone see that which is impossible. you can see the two kids are looking out simultaneously out of two different directions at once. now can you believe these two table tops are the same size and shape. they are so if you measured them they would be. and as I say those two figures are denicol in size and shape. all right that's interesting by doing these. listen to sort of rendered fashion how much stronger delusions are in any case I hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness and of your interest in seeing more cool effects see me outside be happy to show you watch eclipse,0.7473958730697632,"0.7682,0.7865,0.6719,0.7266"
12,AlaindeBotton_2009G.sph.wav,and uses that to come to a complete vision of who you are that is snobbery and the dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays job snobbery you encounter it within minutes at a party when you get asked that famous iconic question of the early twenty one st century what do you do and according to how you answer that question people are either incredibly delighted to see you or look at their watch and make their excuses now to opposite of a snob is your mother not necessarily your mother or indeed mine but as it were the ideal mother somebody who doesn't care about your achievements but unfortunately most people are not our mothers these career crises often actually on a sunday evening just as the sun is starting to set and the gap between my hopes for myself and the reality love in general respect they are willing to accord us that will be strictly defined by our position in the social hierarchy and that's a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers and indeed start caring so much about material goods you know we're often told that we live in very materialistic times greedy people i don't think we are particularly materialistic i think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods it's not the material goods we want it's the rewards we want and that's a new way of looking at luxury goods the next time you see somebody driving a ferrari don't think this is somebody who is greedy think this is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love feel sympathy rather than contempt there are other reasons there are other reasons why from many sources that anyone can achieve anything we've done away with the caste system we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please and it's a beautiful idea along with that is a kind of spirit of equality we're all basically equal there are no strictly defined kind of hierarchies there is one really big problem with this and that problem is envy envy of my life start to diverge so painfully that i normally end up weeping into a pillow i'm mentioning all this real taboo to mention envy but if there is one dominant emotion in modern society that is envy and it's linked to the spirit of equality let me explain i think it would be very unusual for anyone here or anyone watching to be envious of the queen of england even though she is much richer than any of you are and she's got a very large house the reason why we don't envy we can't relate to her and when you can't relate to somebody you don't envy them the closer two people are in age in background in the process of identification the more there is a danger of envy which is incidentally why none of you should ever go to a school reunion because there is no stronger reference point than people one was at school with but the problem generally of modern society is that it turns the whole world into a school everybody is wearing jeans everybody is the same and yet they're not so there is a spirit of equality combined with deep inequalities which makes for a very can make for a very stressful situation it's probably as unlikely that you would nowadays become as rich and famous as bill gates as it was unlikely in the seventeenth century that you would accede to the ranks of the french aristocracy but the point is it doesn't feel that way it's made to feel by magazines and other media outlets that if you've got energy a few bright ideas about technology a garage you i'm mentioning all this because i think this is not merely a personal problem you may think i'm wrong in this but i think that we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated by career crises by moments when what we thought we knew the first kind tells you you can do it you can make it anything is possible and the other kind tell you how to cope with what we politely call low self esteem or impolitely call feeling very bad about yourself a real correlationship a real correlation between a society that tells people that they can do anything and the existence of low self esteem so that's another way in which something that is quite positive can have a nasty kickback there is another reason why we might be feeling more anxious about our careers about our status in the world today than ever before and it is again linked to something nice and that nice thing is called meritocracy now everybody all politicians on left and right agree that meritocracy is a great thing and we should all be trying to make our societies really really meritocratic to get to the bottom also get to the bottom and stay there in other words your position in life comes to seem not accidental but merited and deserved and that makes failure seem much more crushing you know in the middle ages in england when you met a very poor person that person would be described as an unfortunate literally somebody who had not been blessed by fortune an unfortunate a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser and that shows four hundred years of evolution in society and about our lives about our careers comes into contact with a threatening sort of reality it's perhaps easier now than ever before our belief in who is responsible for our lives it's no longer the gods it's us we're in the driving seat that's exhilarating if you're doing well and very crushing if you're not it leads in the worst cases in the analysis of a sociologist like emil durkheim it leads to increased rates of suicide there are more suicides in developed individualistic countries than in any other part of the world and some of the reason for that is that people take what happens to them extremely personally the own their success but they also their failure is there any relief from some of these pressures that i've just been outlining i think there is i just want to turn to a few of them let 's take meritocracy this idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to i think it's a crazy idea completely crazy i will support any politician of left and right with any halfway decent meritocratic idea i am a meritocrat in that sense but i think it's insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic it's an impossible dream the idea that we will make a society where literally everybody the good at the top and the bad at the bottom and it's exactly done as it should be is impossible there are simply too many random factors accidents accidents of birth accidents of things dropping on people 's heads illnesses etc we will never get to grade them to make a good living it's perhaps harder than ever before to stay calm to be free of career anxiety i want to look in modern english that would mean it's a sin to come to any view of who you should talk to dependent on their business card it's not the post that should count and according to st augustine it's only god who can really put everybody in their place and he 's going to do that on the day of judgement with angels and trumpets and the skies will open insane idea if you're a secularist person like me but something very valuable in that idea nevertheless in other words hold your horses when you're coming to judge people you don't necessarily know what someone 's true value is that is an unknown part of them and we shouldn 't behave as though it is what we fear is the judgement and ridicule of others and it exists you know the number one organ of ridicule nowadays is the newspaper and if you open the newspaper any day of the week it's full of people who 've messed up their lives they've slept with the wrong person they've taken the wrong substance they've passed the wrong legislation whatever it is and then are fit for now if i may at some of the reasons why we might be feeling anxiety about our careers why we might be victims of these career crises as tragic art as it developed in the theaters of ancient greece in the fifth century b c was essentially an art form devoted to tracing how people fail and also according them a level of sympathy which ordinary life would not necessarily accord them i remember a few years ago i was thinking about all this and i went to see the sunday sport a tabloid newspaper that i don't recommend you to start reading if you're not familiar with it already i went to talk to them about certain of the great tragedies of western art and i wanted to see how they would seize the bare bones of certain stories if they came in as a news item at the news desk on a saturday afternoon so i told them about othello they had not heard of it but were fascinated by to write the headline for the story of othello they came up with love crazed immigrant kills senators daughter splashed i gave them the plotline of madame bovary again a book they were enchanted to discover and they wrote shopaholic adulteress swallows arsenic after credit then my favorite they really do have a kind of genius all of their own these guys my favorite is sophocles oedipus the king sex with mum was blinding like at one end of the spectrum of sympathy you've got the tabloid newspaper at the other end of the spectrum you've got tragedy and tragic art and i suppose i'm arguing that we should learn a little bit about what's happening in tragic art it would be insane to call hamlet a loser we're weeping softly into our pillows one of the reasons why we might be suffering is that we are surrounded by snobs he is not a loser though he has lost and i think that is the message of tragedy to us and why it's so very very important i think the other thing about modern society and why it causes this anxiety is that we have nothing at its center that is non human we are the first society to be living in a world where we don't worship anything other than ourselves we think very highly of ourselves and so we should we've put people on the moon of extraordinary things and so we tend to worship ourselves our heros are human that's a very new situation most other societies have had right at their center the worship of something transcendent a god a spirit a natural force the universe whatever it is something else that is being worshiped we've slightly lost the habit of doing that which is i think why we're particularly drawn to nature not for the sake of our health though it's often presented that way but because it's an escape from the human anthill it's an escape from our own competition and our own dramas and that's why we enjoy looking at glaciers and oceans and contemplating the from outside its perimeters etc we like to feel in contact with something that is non human and that is so deeply the screen who is very very successful certain ideas would immediately come to mind you would think that person might have made a lot of money achieved renown in some field my own theory of success and i'm somebody who is very interested in success i really want to be successful i'm always thinking how could i be more successful but as i get older i'm also very nuanced about what that word success might an insight that i've had about success you can't be successful at everything we hear a lot of talk about work life balance nonsense you can't have it all you so any vision of success has to admit what it's losing out on where the element of loss is and i think any wise life will accept as i say that there is going to be an element where we are not succeeding and the thing about a successful life is a lot of the time our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own they are sucked in from other people chiefly if you're a man your father and if you're a woman your mother when we're told that banking is a very respectable profession a lot of us want to go into banking when banking is no longer so respectable we lose interest in banking we are highly open to suggestion so what i want to argue for is not that we should give up on our ideas of success but we should make sure that they are our own we should focus in on our ideas and make sure that we own them that we are truly the authors of our own ambitions because it's bad enough not getting what you want even worse to have an idea of what it is you want and find out at the end of a journey that it isn 't in fact what you wanted all along so i'm going to end it there but what i really want to stress is by all means success yes but let 's accept the strangeness of some of our ideas let 's probe away at our notions of success let 's make sure our ideas of success are truly our own thank you very much that was fascinating how do you reconcile this idea of someone being it being bad to think of someone as a loser the idea that a lot of people like of seizing control of your life and that a society that encourages that perhaps has to have some winners and losers yes i think it's merely the randomness of the winning and losing process that i wanted to stress because the emphasis nowadays is so much on the justice of everything and politicians always talk about justice now i am a firm believer in justice i just think that it is impossible so we should do everything we can we should do everything we can to pursue it but at the end of the day we should always remember that whoever is facing us whatever has happened i mean do you believe that you can combine your kind of kinder gentler philosophy of work with a successful economy or do you think that you can 't but it doesn't matter too much that we're putting too much emphasis on the nightmare thought is that frightening people is the best way to get work out of them and that somehow the crueler the environment the more people will rise to the challenge you want to think who would you like as your ideal dad and your ideal dad is somebody who is tough but gentle and it's a very hard line to make we need fathers as it were the exemplary father figures in society,1,"the movie I can leave Korea crises Sunday evening just as the sun is starting to set and the gap between my hopes for myself and the reality of my life not to divulge so painfully that I normally end up a weeping it into a pillow. I mention this because I think this is not merely a personal problem you may think I'm wrong in this but I think that we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated by Korea crisis by moments when what we thought we knew about our lives about Icarus comes into contact with a threatening social reality it's easier now than ever before to make a good living it's perhaps harder than ever before to stay calm to be free of Korea anxiety I want to look now if I make that some of the reasons why we might be feeling anxiety about a career as a weeping softly into what are the reasons why. a peace offering is surrounded by snobs some bad news who's come to Oxford from abroad is a real problem with nobody because sometimes people from outside the UK mansion that snow. The distinctive the UK phenomenon fixated on country houses and titled the bad news is that not true snowbury is a global phenomenon we are Global organization is it exists at what is a snow of a snobiz anybody who takes a small part of you and uses that to come to a complete vision of who you are that is snow break and the dominant kind of just nowadays is job snobbery you encountered within minutes of the party when you get off that famous iconic question of the early 21st century what do you do and according to the CEO look at watch and make their excuses now the opposite of a snow is your mother. mine but unfortunately after that maybe something loving General respect other willing to record it that will be strictly defined by our opposition in the social hierarchy and that he's not caring so much about material Goods in Wilton told that we live in very materialistic times that we're all greedy people particularly materialistic Society we just simply pegs so I can emotional rewards to the acquisition of material Goods it's not the material Goods we want it's the reward and that's a new way of looking at luxury goods the next time you see somebody driving a Ferrari do you think this is somebody who's greedy think this is somebody was incredibly vulnerable and in need of love and otherwise. feel. feel feel sympathy rot rather than contempt there other reasons. there are other reasons why perhaps harder now to feel, than ever before one of these and its power because it's linked to something that's rather nice is the hope we will have for our careers never before have expectations being so high but what you and beings can achieve without lifespan with told from many sources that anyone could achieve anything we've done away with a car system we are now in a system with anyone can rise to any position they please and it's a beautiful idea basically equal there are no strictly defined as a kind of a rocket is one really big problem with this and the problem is Envy Envy the realtor has one dominant emotion in modern society that is envy and it's late the spirit of equality let me explain I think it will be very unusual for anyone here anyone watching to be envious of the Queen of England even though she's a much richer than any of you are and watch how the reason why we don't end. the reason why we didn't do that so she's too weird she's simply too strange we can't relate to her she speaks in a funny way she comes to this old place so we can relate to him and when you can't relate to somebody you don't leave the closer to people our age and background in in the process of identification the mold as a danger of ending which is why none of you should ever go to school reunions because there is no stronger reference point then people won't when was at school with for the problem generative modern societies it turns the whole world into a school everybody's wearing jeans everybody's the same and yet they're not so there's a spirit of equality combined with DEET inequalities which makes for a very handy for a very stressful situation is probably as unlikely that you would nowadays become as rich and famous is Bill Gates as it was unlikely in the seventeenth Century that you would have received the ranks of the French but the point is it doesn't feel that way it's made to feel by magazines and other media outlet that if you go to energy a few bright ideas about technology. and the consequences of this problem make themselves felt in bookshops when you go to a large book shop and look at the self-help section that I sometimes do self help books that are produced in the well today they were basically two kinds the first time tells you you can do it you can make it anything's possible and the other kind tell you how to cope with what we politely cool low self-esteem or in political feeling very bad about yourself there's a realtor relationship between correlation between a society that tells people they can do anything and the existence of low self-esteem so that's another way in which is another reason why we might be feeling more anxious about a career out of status in the world today than ever before I need to do something nice and that nice thing it's called meritocracy not everybody all politicians on left and right agree that meritocracy is a great thing and we should all be trying to make these really really meritocratic. Society is one in which if you put talent and energy and skill you will get the top nothing should hold you back the beautiful idea the problem is if you really believe in a society where there is Merit to get to the top get to the top and in the phone with nasty way believe in a society where those who deserve to get to the bottom also get to the bottom and say that your position is like a c-note accidentally put merited and deserve and that makes phalia see much more crushing during the Middle Ages in England when you met a very poor person that person would be described as an unfortunate glittery someone would not being blessed by Fortune an unfortunate nowadays give me the United States a loser does a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser and that shows four hundred years of evolution in society and our belief and who is responsible for our lives it's no longer to go.. we're in the driving seat that's exhilarating if you're doing well and very crushing if you'll note it leads in worst cases and Analysis of sociologist like it leads to increased rates of suicide other remove suicide in developed individualistic countries than in any other part of the world and some of the reason for that is the people take what happens to them extremely personally they own a success but they also own the phylum is there any relief from some of these pressures that I've just been outlining I think there is I just want to turn to a few of them let's take meritocracy I think it's a crazy idea completely crazy I will support any politicians left and right with any halfway decent meritocratic idea I'm a married person but I think it's insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic it's an Impossible Dream the idea that we will make everybody's grated. simply too many random factors accidents accidents of birth accident so I think chopping people's heads illnesses at cetera we will never get to grade them as they should be quote by Saint Augustine city of God what he says it's a sin to judge Any Man by his post in Modern English that would mean it's a sin to come to any of you who should talk to dependent on that business card it's not the post that should count who can really put everybody in that place and he's going to do that on the day of judgment with angels and trumpet in the skies will say no idea if you like me but something very valuable in that I did never let another word for hold your horses when you coming to judge people you don't necessarily know what someone's True Value is that is an unknown part of them to behave as though it is known in comfort for all this when we think about failing in life when we think about phalia one of the reasons why we fear of failing is not just a loss of income loss.. what we spell is the judgment and ridicule of others and it exists the number one organ of ridicule nowadays is the newspaper and if you read the newspaper any day of the week it's full of people who stopped their lives they slept the wrong person they taking the wrong substance they passed the wrong piece of legislation whatever it is and then outfit for another day or failed as is there any alternative today I think Gloria School tentative tragedy tragic on as it developed in the theaters of ancient Greece and the 5th Century BC was essentially another word for devoted to tracing how people fail and recording them a level of sympathy which ordinary life would not necessarily a few years ago and I went to see the Sunday sport tabloid newspaper that I don't recommend you to start reading if you're not familiar with it already and about. how they would seize the baboon's of certain stories if they came in as a news only to love crazed immigrant kill senator's daughter is off MacArthur credit fraud alert my favorite and you ready to have a kind of Genius order the right guy my favorite sex with mom with blinding. put it away if you like at one end of the spectrum of sympathy you've got the Tabloid newspaper at the other end of the spectrum you've got tragedy and transmit God and I suppose I should learn a little bit about what's happening in tragic it would be insane to call Hamlet a loser is not a loser that he has lost and I think that is the message of tragedy to us and why it's a very very important that you have a thing about making society and what causes anxiety is that we have nothing at its center that is known human we all the first society that we live in a world where we doing anything other than we think very highly of ourselves and so we should we put people on the moon the most extraordinary things and so we tend to err is human Heroes that's a very pleased about us enter the worship of something Transcendent a gold a spirit a natural force the universe whatever it is something else that is being worshipped off the habit of doing that would you like to eat while we particularly drawn to make. not for the sake of all Health there's nothing presented that way because it's an Escape from the human and he'll escape from our own competition and our own dramas glaciers and oceans and countries outside the perimeters Etc we like to feel in contact with something that is normal human and that is so deeply important to us talking about really is success and failure and one of the interesting things about success is that we think we know what it means behind a certain ideas would immediately come to mind you would think that person might have made a lot of money a chief Renown in some field Mayan series success and when somebody is very interested in how can I be more successful as I get older I'm also very nuanced that what that word success might mean he isn't inside the right out of a success you can't be successful at everything. life balance known since you can't have it all you come so any vision of success has to admit what it's losing out on where the element of losses and I think what it would accept as I say there's going to be an element of succeeding and the thing about a successful life is that a lot of the time or I did of what it would mean to live successfully on not our own something from other people chiefly if you were a man your father and if your women your mother has been coming home this message to about 80 years no one's listening hard enough but I very much believe that that's true we want to suck your messages from everything from the television advertising so it's a hugely powerful forces that Define what we want and how we view ourselves when we told the banking is a very respectable profession a load of us want to go to banking when Bank he's no longer respectable we lose interest in fact we are highly open to suggestion. who is not that we should give up on our ideas of success but we should make sure that they are all right we should focus in on our ideas and make sure that we own them that we are true to the office tomorrow and I'm bitching because it's bad enough not getting what you want but it's even worse to have an idea of what it is you want and find out at the end of The Journey it isn't in fact what you wanted all along and ruined it that but what I really want to distress is I will mean success yes but that's acceptable strangeness of Summer I did approve away at all Notions of success let's make sure our ideas of success truly our own thank you very much. how do you reconcile the idea of someone being being bad with the like of you know seizing control of your life and society that encourages that has to have someone is in losses of the winning and losing process that I want to stress because the emphasis nowadays so much is on the justice of everything and politicians always do everything we can we should do everything we can to pass to it but at the end of the day we should always remember that whoever is facing us whatever has happened in that live there will be a strong element of what I'm trying to leave room for a because otherwise it can get quite. You can come by and you'll kind of kind of Legend to the philosophy of work we were the successful economy or do you think that. Yukon. But it doesn't matter that much that was putting too much emphasis on that the night Mass tort is that frightening people is the best way to get workouts with them and that somehow the rule of the environment the more people will rise to the challenge you want to think what we would you like to do that stuff but gentle we need fathers at it with exemplary father figures in society avoiding the two extremes which is the authoritarian disciplinarian on one hand I don't the other the Lacs I know rules option thank you very much",0.75,0.7161
13,AlanKay_2007.sph.wav,to actually get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves so what i'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image about a fifth of a second later like that and they're getting faster and faster each time and if i stack these guys then we see the differences the increase in the speed is constant and they say oh yeah constant acceleration we've done that already and how shall we and verify that we actually the ball and run the movie at the same time very cleverly by running a ball down backwards down the strings of his lute i pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that this is actually this stuff works here gravity here 's this increase the speed by something increase the ship 's speed if i start the little game here that the kids have done it'll crash the but if i oppose gravity here we but in fact if you think of it children are the future we send to the future forget about messages children are the future the problem you have with this summer we're going to build five million of these one hundred dollar laptops and maybe fifty million next year but we that means that we once again have a thing where we can put technology out but the mentoring that is required to go from to draw is not that you can't move your hand but that the way your brain perceives images dollars so this is actually cheap and einstein said is faulty trying to perceive images into objects rather than seeing what's there and to prove it she says the exact size and shape of these tabletops is the same and i'm going to prove it to you she does this with cardboard but since i have an expensive computer here rotate this little guy around and now having seen that and i've seen it hundreds of times because i use this in every talk i give i still can't see that they're the same size and shape and i doubt that you can either great way to start i think measure very very carefully and if you measure very very carefully with a stiff arm a straight edge you'll see that those two shapes are exactly same size and the talmud saw this a long time ago saying we see things not as they are but as we are i certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that insight with my view of simplicity is to back then if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here it's a waking dream and understanding that that is what we actually exist in one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history and what that means simple and understandable might not be actually simple or understandable and things we think are complex might be made simple and understandable take a look at ted here you are understanding why we're here what's going on with no difficulty at all somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws we can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel the way i think of it is we can't learn to see until we admit we're blind finding ways to see things and little additional parts for our brain made out of powerful ideas that help us see the world in different ways and these are in the form of sensory apparatus most importantly in the ability to change perspective on things i'll talk about that a little bit it's this change in perspective and what it is we think we're perceiving that has helped us make more not taught in any k through twelve curriculum in america that i'm aware of one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more the best ai in the planet would find it complex and confusing and my little dog watson would find it simple and understandable but would miss the point and in fact we can keep on doing it for a very long time but murray gell mann yesterday talked about emergent properties another name for them could be architecture as a metaphor for taking the same old material and non obvious non simple ways of combining it what murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature of having the descriptions at various levels be rather similar all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles are both sticky and stand offish and they're in violent motion those three things give rise to all the different levels so when i saw the roslings in conveying complex ideas simply but then i had a thought of boy maybe it's too simple and i put some effort in to try and check to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side and i found that they matched up very well so the roslings have been able to do simplicity without removing what's important about the data whereas the film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell as a former molecular biologist i didn't like that at all not because it wasn't beautiful or anything but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology and that is why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed and what we saw yesterday was every reaction was fortuitous they just swooped in the air and bound and something have a great time and of course if you're a speaker those molecules are spinning at the rate of about a million revolutions per second agitating back and forth their size every two nanoseconds they're completely crowded together they're jammed they're bashing up against each other and if you don't understand that in your mental model of this stuff what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous and i think that's exactly the wrong image for when you're trying to teach science so another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication with the actual understanding of some principle so a kid who 's fourteen in high school this version of the like hans rosling direct one one that gives you more of the feeling of math is something closer to pythagoras own proof which goes like this so here we have this triangle and if we surround that a speaker finds this complex tricky but in hans rosling 's case he had a secret weapon yesterday literally c square with three more triangles and we copy that notice that we can that is all you have to do and this kind of proof is the kind of proof now let 's go to young children this is a very unusual teacher who was a kindergarten and first grade teacher but was a natural mathematician so she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music but is a terrific musician she just had a feeling for math and here are her six year olds and she's got them making shapes out of a shape and this teacher did on every project was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project and then something like science so they'd created these artifacts now she had them look at them in his sword swallowing act and i must say i thought of quite a few objects that i might try to swallow today and finally gave up and do this laborious which i thought for a long time until she explained to me was to slow them down so they'll think so they're cutting out the but the whole point of this thing is them to look at this chart and fill it out what have you noticed about what you did and so six year old lauren there noticed that the first one took one and the second one took three more and the total was four on that one the third one took five more and the total was nine on that one and then the next one so she saw right away that the additional tiles that you had to add around the edges was always going to grow by two so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there and she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six so that's what lauren did and then the teacher gillian ishijima had the kids bring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor and everybody went batshit no matter what the shapes were the growth law is the same and the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progressions as a first order discrete differential equation and a second order discrete he just did it and that was by six year olds so let 's take a look now how we might use the computer for some of this wonderful thing so puck meant and so the first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children do i'm using the software that we're putting on the one hundred dollar laptop so i'd like to draw a little not only are we fools in the pejorative sense but that we're easily fooled in fact what shakespeare was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled so we're actually looking forward to it and here 's a little behavior car forward each time i click it car turn if i want to make a little script to do this over and over again i just drag these guys out goes straight that's a bit of a revelation for nine year olds a little bit like kissing your sister as far as driving a car so the kids want to do a steering wheel so they draw a steering wheel we'll there and to just drop it into the script here and now i can steer the car with the steering wheel we get a visual pattern of what these nine year olds called acceleration so how did the children do science to the we go to magic shows in order to be fooled not and this makes many things fun but it makes it difficult because of course he didn't bother doing the experiment and neither did st thomas aquinas and it was not until galileo actually did it that an adult thought like a child only four hundred years ago we get one child like that about every classroom of thirty kids will actually cut straight to the chase now what if we want to look at this more closely we can take a movie of what's going on but even if we single stepped this movie it's tricky to see what's going on and so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side or stack them up so when the children see this they say ah acceleration,1,"great way to start I think with my view of Simplicity is to. take a look at Ted here you are understanding why we're here what's going on with no difficulty at all. the best AI on the planet would find it complex and confusing and my little dog Watson would find it simple and understandable but with missed the point. he would have a great time and of course if you're a speaker. here like Hans rosling a speaker finds this complex tricky but in the hands rosling's case he had a secret weapon yesterday literally in his sword swallowing act and I must say I thought of quite a few objects that I might try to swallow today and finally gave up on that he just did it and that was a wonderful thing so talk meant not only are we fools in the pejorative sense but they were easily fooled in fact what Shakespeare was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled so we're actually looking forward to it. we got a magic shows in order to be fooled. and this makes. many things fun but it makes it difficult to actually the get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves and our friend Betty Edwards the drawing on the right side of the brain lady chose these two tables to her drawing class and says. the problem you have with learning to draw is not that you can't move your hand but that the way your brain perceives images. is faulty trying to perceive images into objects rather than seeing what's there and prove it she says the exact size and shape of these table tops is the same and I'm going to prove it to you she does this with cardboard but since I have an expensive computer here. I'll just rotate this little guy around and. now having seen that and I've seen it hundreds of times cuz I use this and every talk I give I still can't see that they're the same size and shape and I doubt that you can either. Don't You artist do well what artist do is to measure. they measure very very careful and if you measure very very carefully with the stiff arm and a straightedge you'll see that those two shapes are exactly the. same size in the talmud. saw this a long time ago saying we see things not as they are but as we are I certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that Insight back then if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion. the world is not as it seems we see things as we are then what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here it's a waking dream and understanding that that is what we actually exist in is one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history. what that mean simple and understandable might not be actually simple or understandable and things we think are complex might be made simple and understandable. somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws going to think of ourselves as kind of a noisy Channel. the way I think of it as we can't learn to see until we admit we're blind. once you start down with this very humble level then you can start finding ways to see things and what's happened over the last four hundred years in particular is that human beings have invented brainlets. little additional parts for our brain made out of powerful ideas that help us see the world in different ways and these are in the form of sensory apparatus telescope was Microsoft's reasoning apparatus various ways of thinking. and most importantly in the ability to change perspective on things I'll talk about that a little bit it's this change in perspective on what it is we think we're perceiving that has helped us make more progress in the last 400 years than we have in the rest of human history and yet it is not taught in any case through 12 curriculum in America that I'm aware of. the one of the things that goes from simple to complex as when we do more we like more we do more in a kind of a stupid way the Simplicity gets complex. and the fact we can keep on doing it for a very long time. but Mari Gilman yesterday talked about emergent properties. another name for them could be architecture as a metaphor for taking the same old material and thinking about. non-obvious 9 simple ways of combining it and in fact what Maria was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature of having the descriptions at various levels be rather. similar all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles are both sticky and standoffish and they're in violent motion. those three things give rise to all the different levels of what seemed to be complexity in our world. but how simple the one I saw the rosling's gapminder stuff a few years ago I just thought it was the greatest thing I've seen. in conveying complex ideas simply but then I had a thought of but maybe it's too simple and I put some effort in to try and check to see how well these simple portrayals of Trends over time actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side and I found they matched up very well so the rosling's have been able to do simplicity. without removing what's important about the data whereas the the film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell as a as a former molecular biologist I didn't like that at all. not because it wasn't beautiful or anything but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology and that is why is there any possibility at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they can buy it together and be capitalized. and what we saw yesterday was every reaction was fortuitous they just swooped in there and bound and something happen. but in fact those molecules are spinning at the rate of about 1000000 revolutions per second. they're agitating back and forth their in their size every two nanoseconds they're completely crowded together their jam they're bashing up against each other. and if you don't understand that in your mental model of this stuff. what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious in 42 it is and I think that's exactly the wrong image for when you're trying to teach science. another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication. with the actual understanding of some principal so a kid who's 14 and High School. get this version of the Pythagorean theorem. which is a truly subtle and interesting proof but the fact is not a good way to start learning about mathematics. the more direct 11 that gives you more of the feeling. of math is something closer to me but the address is on proof which goes like this so here we have this triangle and if we surround that sees square with three more triangles and we copy that notice it we can move those triangles down like this and that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious. and bingo. that is all you have to do. and this kind of proof is the kind of proof that you need to learn when you're learning mathematics and where to get an idea of what it means before you look into the literally twelve or fifteen hundred proofs of Pythagoras Theorem it happened discovered. let's go to young children. this is a very unusual teacher who. was a kindergarten and first grade teacher but was a natural mathematician so she was like that jazz musician friends you have never studied music but is a terrific musician she just had a feeling for Math and. here are her six year olds and she's got them. making shapes out of a shade so they pick a shape they like like a diamond or a square or triangle or trapezoid and then they are trying to make the next larger shape of that same shape in the next larger shaping see the trapezoids are a little challenging there. and one of these this teacher did on every project was to have the children act like first was a creative arts project and then something like science so they'd created these artifacts now she had them look at them and do this laborious which I thought for a long time until she explained to me was the slow them down so they'll think so they're cutting out the little pieces of cardboard here and pasting them up but the whole point of this thing is to. for them to look at this chart. and fill it out what have you noticed about what you did and so six-year-olds Lauren their notice that the first one took one and the second one took three more. and the total was for on that one the third one to five more and the total was nine on that one and then the next one so she saw it right away that the additional tiles that you had to add around the edges was always going to grow by 2 so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there and she could see that these were the square numbers up until about 6 or she wasn't sure what 6 * 6 was and what 7 * 7 was but then she was confident. again so that's what Lauren did and then the teacher Jillian issue Jima had the kids bring all of their projects up to the front of room and put them in the floor and everybody went back. holy shit they're the same. no matter what the shapes were the Groves law is the same and the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progressions as a first-order discrete differential equation and a second-order discrete differential equation. derived by 6 year olds. that's pretty amazing that isn't what we usually try to teach six year olds. so let's take a look now at. how we might use the computer for some of this. answer the first first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children. do I'm using them software that we're putting on the $100 laptop. do you like to draw a little car here. just do this very quickly. and put a big. tire on them. can I get a little objects here and I can look inside this object I'll call it a car and here's a little Behavior car forward each time I click it car turn if I want to make a little script to do this over and over again I just drag these guys out. and said I'm going. and I can try steering the car here by see the car turned by 5 here so what if I click the stand is 0. go straight that's a big Revelation for 9 year olds. make it going the other direction but of course that's a little bit like kissing your sister as far as driving a car I said the kids want to do a steering wheel. should I draw a steering wheel. and we'll call this a wheel. and. to this Wheels heading here if I turn this wheel you can see that number over there going minus and positive that's kind of an invitation to pick up the name of those numbers coming out there and just drop it into the script here. and now I can steer the car with the steering wheel. that's interesting you know how much trouble that children have with variables but by learning it this way in the situated fashion they never forget from the single trial what a variable is and how to use it and we can reflect here the way Julian this regime is dead so if you look at the little script here the speed is always going to be 30 we're going to move the car according to that over and over again. I'm dropping a little. For each one of these things you're evenly spaced cuz it's 30 a part and what if I do this progression that the six year olds did of saying okay I'm going to increase the speed by two each time. and I'm going to Kris The Distance by the speed each time what do I get there. we got a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration. so how did the children do science. Archer. don't pay any attention to what anybody else moved. look up the Apple. stop watches. what are the shotgun and the SpongeBob because they're two totally different way and if you drop them at the same time maybe they'll drop in the same Stadium Drive. so obviously Aristotle never ask a child about this particular point because of course he didn't bother doing the experiment and neither did Saint Thomas Aquinas it was not until Galileo actually did it that an adult thought like a child only 400 years ago. we got one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids will actually cut straight to the chase now what if we want to look at this more closely we can take a movie. what's going on but even if we single step this movie It's tricky to see what's going on and so what we can do is we can lay out the frame side by side or stacked them up when the children see this they say hi celeration. remembering back four months when they did their car sideways and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is and. so what I'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image about a fifth of a second later. like that and they're getting faster and faster each time if I stack these guys up. then we see the difference is the increase in the speed. is constant and they said oh yeah constant acceleration we we've done that already and how shall we how should we look and verify that we actually. Havasu can't tell much from just making the ball drop there but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time. we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model. Galileo by the way did this. very cleverly by running a ball down backwards down the strings of his loot. I pull out those apples to remind my self to tell you that this is actually probably a Newton in the Apple type story but it's a great story. and I thought it would do just one thing. on the. $100 laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here. so once you have gravity here's this increase the speed by something increase the ship's speed if I start the little game here the kids have done it will crash the spaceship but if I oppose gravity here we go one more. there we go. okay. I guess the. best way to end this is with two quotes Marshall mcluhan said children are the message messages that we send to the Future. but in fact if you think of it children are the future we send to the Future forget about messages. children are the future. and children in the first and second world and most especially in the third world need mentors. this summer we're going to build 5 million of these hundred dollar laptops and maybe 50 million next year. but we couldn't create 1,000 new teachers this summer to save our life. that means that we once again have a thing where we can put technology out but the mentoring that is required to go from a simple new I chat instant messaging system to something with depth is missing I believe this has to be done with a new kind of user interface and this use new kind of user interface could be done with an expenditure of about a hundred million dollars. sounds like a lot but it is literally 18 minutes of what we're spending in Iraq. 28 billion a month 18 minutes is 100 million 100 million dollars so this is actually cheap and Einstein said. things should be as simple as possible but not simpler thank you",0.75390625,
14,AlanRussell_2006.sph.wav,and that bio reactor will lay down in the wound bed the gun that you see there sprays cells that's going to spray cells over that area the reactor will serve to fertilize the environment deliver other things as well at the same time and therefore we will that lawn as opposed to try the sodding approach it's a completely different way of doing it so my eighteen minutes is up so let me finish up with some good news and maybe a little bit of bad news the good news is that this is happening today it's very powerful work clearly the images kind of get that across it's incredibly difficult because it's highly inter disciplinary this is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine this is not regenerative medicine regenerative medicine is what business week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago the idea a number of governments and a number of regions have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease the japanese government were perhaps the first when they decided to invest first three billion european union same thing china the same thing china just launched a national tissue engineering center the first year budget was two hundred and fifty million us dollars in the united states we've had a somewhat different approach we and be in the real world as president we've had a different approach and the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along but there's been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way and i'm going to finish up with a quote maybe a little cheap shot at the director of the nih who 's a very charming man to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that twenty seven point five billion dollars get next year and focus it in a strategic way to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients and at the end of a very testy meeting what the nih director said is your vision is larger than our appetite i'd like to close by saying that no one 's going to change our vision but together we can change his appetite thank is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like and i'll come back to that theme a few times instead of doing that we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue so that at the end of the treatment you are the same as you were at the beginning of the you today about hopefully converting fear into hope when we go to the physician this is a good idea very few good ideas are truly novel and this is just the same if you look back in history charles lindbergh who was better known for flying airplanes was actually one of the first people along with alexis carrel one of the nobel laureates from rockefeller we've come a long way since then i'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on but before doing that what i'd like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life and reducing poverty and essentially today when we go to the doctor 's office and we walk in there are words that we just don't want to hear there are words that we're truly afraid and you can basically see that the richer a country is the older the people are within it why is this important and why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now if the average age of your population is thirty then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken ankle every now and again maybe a little bit of if the average age in your country is forty five to fifty five now the average person is looking at diabetes early onset diabetes heart failure coronary artery disease workers per retiree forty one people who were basically outside of being really sick paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease in two thousand and ten two workers per retiree in the u s and this is matched in every industrialized wealthy country in the world how can you actually afford to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this this is age versus cost of health care and you can see that right around age forty five forty to forty five there's a sudden spike in the cost of health care it's actually quite interesting if you do the right studies you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care plotted over your lifetime and about seven years before you're about to die there's a spike and you can actually we won 't get into that there are very few things very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what i would call healthy aging i'd suggest there are four things and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system all those things do is change who pays they don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment one thing you can do is not treat you can ration health care we won 't talk about that anymore it's too depressing you can prevent obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention but perhaps most interesting to me anyway and most important is the idea of diagnosing a and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom think of it in terms of ten twenty thirty forty years and we do ok insulin 's a pretty good therapy but eventually it stops working and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease why couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease perhaps even before it was symptomatic and it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it but if it worked we would truly be able to do something different this video i think gets across the concept that i'm talking about quite dramatically this is a newt re growing its limb if a newt can do this kind of thing why can't we i'll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment what i want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease why it's important why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if you think it already but what we're talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body tissues and for organs themselves so today 's reality is that if we get sick the message is we will treat your symptoms and you need to adjust to a new way of life i would pose to you that tomorrow and when tomorrow is we could debate but it's within the foreseeable future we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation a limb prosthetic up here similar actually to the one that the soldier that's come back from iraq there are three hundred and seventy soldiers that have come back from iraq that have lost limbs imagine if instead of facing that they could actually face the regeneration of that limb it's a wild concept i'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept but it's applicable again to every organ system how can we do that the way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body we need to learn to speak the body 's language and to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus a mammalian fetus if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy will re grow that so our dna has the capacity to do these kinds of wound healing mechanisms it's a natural process but it is lost as we age in a child so to engage in that conversation with the body we need to speak the body 's language and there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today i'm going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body the first is cellular therapies clearly we heal ourselves in a natural process using cells to do most of the work therefore if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body they may do the healing and where we are clinically today and where we might go tomorrow and what some of the hurdles are and we're going to do all of that in eighteen minutes then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself and finally we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to if you threw away all the cells and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself and he asked a very important question he asked the question if i take that material which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine and i place it somewhere else on a person 's body would it give a tissue specific response or would it make small intestine if i tried to make a new ear i wouldn't be telling you this story if it wasn't compelling the picture i'm about to show you is a compelling picture however for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends the lights are down this is a good time to look at your feet check your blackberry do anything other than look at the screen what i'm about to show you i want to start with this slide because this slide sort of tells the story the way science magazine thinks of it this was an issue from two thousand and two is a diabetic ulcer and although it's good to laugh before we look at this this is the reality of diabetes i think a lot of times we hear about diabetics diabetic ulcers we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment which is amputation if you can't heal it so i'm going to put the slide up now it won 't be up for long this is a diabetic ulcer it's tragic the treatment for this is amputation this is an older lady she has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes and has decided to die with what s left of her body intact and this lady decided after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer that she would try this new therapy that steve invented that's what the wound looked like eleven weeks later that material contained only natural signals and that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn't have before there's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you i'll let you know when you can look again this is a horse the horse is not in pain if the horse was in pain i wouldn't show you this slide the horse just has another nostril that's developed because of a riding accident just a few weeks after treatment in this case taking that material turning it into a gel that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human it was basically a regenerative medicine issue regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple and packing that area and then repeating the treatment a few times and the horse heals up and if you took an ultrasound of that area it would look great a dolphin where the fin 's been re attached there are now four hundred thousand patients around the world who have used that material to heal their could you regenerate a limb darpa just gave steve fifteen million dollars to lead an eight institution project to begin the process of asking that question and i'll show you the fifteen million dollar picture this is a seventy eight year old man who 's lost the end of his fingertip remember that i mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips after treatment that's what it looks like this is happening today this is clinically relevant today there are materials which do this there are the heart patches but could you go a little further could you say instead of using material can i take some cells along with the material and remove a damaged piece of tissue put a bio degradable material on there you can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish this was done by now i'm going to show you cell based to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient again if you're squeamish you don't want to watch but this one 's kind of cool this is a bypass operation just like what al gore had with a in this case at the end of the bypass operation you're going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient and i'm standing up here because at one point i'm going to show you that everybody can understand it's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant just how early this technology is here go the stem cells right into the beating heart of the patient and if you look really carefully it's going to be right around this point you'll actually see a back flush you see the cells coming back out we need all sorts of new technology new devices to get the cells to the right place at the right time just a little bit of data a tiny bit of data this was a randomized trial at this time this was an n of twenty now there's an n of about one hundred these are now two years out the coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state this is the same procedure but now done minimally invasively with only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure there go the cells we don't have time to go into all of those details but basically that works too you can take patients who are less sick and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state through that kind of therapy here 's another example of stem cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet but i think very soon will be so we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there we know that if we have a damaged hip you can put an artificial hip in and this is the idea that science magazine used on their front cover it's a great source of stem cells stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid so you could go in you could get your tummy tuck out comes the liposuction fluid and in this case the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons all done in the lab and i think fairly soon you will see patients being treated with their own fat derived or adipose derived stem cells i talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease here 's just one example before i close up this is equally tragic we very abiding and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the institute for surgical research in the us army who have to treat the now eleven thousand kids that have come back from iraq many of those patients are very severely burned and if there's anything that's been learned about burn it's that we don't know how to treat it everything that is done to treat burn basically we do a sodding approach we make something over here and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound and we try and get the two to take in this case here a new wearable bio reactor has been designed it should be tested clinically later this year at isr by joerg gerlach in pittsburgh,1,"I'm going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope when we go to the physician today when we go to the doctor's office and we walk in there Woods that we just don't want to hear their words that would truly afraid of diabetes cancer Parkinson's Alzheimer's heart failure lung failure things that we know debilitating diseases for which there is relatively little but can be dumb. what I want to lay up for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease why it's important why without it perhaps our Healthcare System will melt down if if you think it already happened and I clinically today and what we might go tomorrow with some of the hurdles out and I'm going to do all of that in 18 minutes I promise this slide because the slides of tells the story The Way Science magazine thinks of it this was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human it was basically a regenerative medicine issue regenerative medicine is an extraordinary simple concept that everybody can understand it's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant time scale. so we know how to do this and many other ways that are up there we we know that if we have a damaged if you can put an artificial hip in and this is the idea that Science magazine used on that front cover this is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine this is not regenerative medicine is what business we can put up when they did a story about return to Medicine not too long ago the idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like and I'll come back to that theme a few times instead of doing that we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissues so that the end of the treatment you wear the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment. very few good ideas if you agree to this is a good idea of very few good ideas a truly novel and this is just the same if you look back in history Charles Lindbergh who was better known for flying aeroplanes was actually one of the first people along with Alexis Carrel won the Nobel laureates from Rockefeller to begin to think about could you culture organs and they publish this book in 1937 where they actually began to think about what could you do in bioreactors to grow whole organs we've come a long way since then I'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on but before doing that what I'd like to do is share my depression about the Health Care system in the need for this with you many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life and reducing poverty and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe one of the challenges is that the ritual we are the longer we live. and the longer we live the more expensive it is to take care of our diseases as we get older this is simply the wealth of a country versus the percentage of population over the age of 65 and you can basically see the direction our country is the older the people are within it why is this important and why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now is the average age of your population is 30 than the average kind of disease that you have to treat as maybe a broken ankle every now and again maybe a little bit of asthma if the average age in your country is 45 to 55 now the average person is looking at diabetes early onset diabetes heart failure coronary artery disease things that are inherently more difficult to treat and much more expensive to treat just have a look at the demographics in the US here this is there from the Untied States of America in 1930 there were 41 workers per retiree 41 people who would basically out. side of being really sick paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease in 2010 to workers for retiree in the US every industrialized wealthy country in the world. how can you actually afford to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this this is age versus cost of healthcare and you can see the right around age 45 40 to 45 does a sudden spike in the a in the cost of healthcare sexy quite interesting if you do the right studies you can look at how much you was an individual spend on your own health care place it over your lifetime and about seven years before you're about to die there's a spike and you can actually. we we won't get into that. there are very few things very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and end and experienced what I would call Healthy aging I'd suggest there are four things and none of these things including Insurance system are illegal system will those things do is change poupee they don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is one thing you can do is not treat you can ration Healthcare we won't talk about that anymore it's too depressing you can prevent obviously a lot of money should be put into prevention but perhaps most interesting to me anyway most important is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom think of in terms of diabetes for instance today with diabetes what do we do we diagnose the disease eventually wants to become symptomatic and then we. the symptom for 10 20 30 40 years but eventually it stops working and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of a debilitating disease. why couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease Pat season before it was symptomatic and it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it but if it would we would truly be able to do something different this video I think it's across the concept that I'm talkin about quite dramatically this is a newt regrowing it slim if a nuke can do this kind of thing why can't we I'll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment but what we're talkin about in regards of medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body. for tissues and Ferb for organs themselves. so today today's reality is that if we get sick the messages we will treat your symptoms and you need to adjust to a new way of life I would post you the tomorrow and when tomorrow is we could debate but it but it's within the foreseeable future we will talk about regenerative Rehabilitation there's a limb prosthetic up here similar actually to the one that sold your that's come back from Iraq Center 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs imagine if instead of facing that they could actually face the Regeneration of that limits a wild concept I'll show you where we are at the moment working towards that concept. but it's applicable again to every organ system how can we do that the way to do that is to develop a conversation with a body we need to learn to speak the body language and to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus in the mail and fetus if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy will regrow that limb. so I DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound healing mechanisms it's a natural process but it is lost as as we age in a child before the age of about six months if they lose their finger tip and an accident the regrow their fingertip by the time that 5 they won't be able to do that anymore so to engage in that conversation with the body we need to speak the body language and there are certain tools in our tool box that allow us to do this today I'm going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body the first is cellular therapies clearly we heal ourselves in a natural process using cells to do most of the wood that for if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body they may do the healing. secondly we can use materials we had yesterday about the importance of new materials if we can invent materials design materials or extract materials from a natural environment that we might be able to have those materials in Juice the body to heal itself and finally we may be able to use Smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal. I'm going to show you an example of each of these I'm going to start with materials Steel battle axe is at the University of Pittsburgh about a decade ago had a remarkable idea and that idea was that the small intestine of a pig if you threw away all the cells and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself and he asked a very important question to ask a question if I take that material which is a natural material that usually in juices healing in the small intestine and I place it somewhere else on a person's body would it give a tissue specific response or would it make small intestine if I try to make a new hit. I wouldn't be telling you the story if it's if it wasn't compelling the picture I'm about to show you. is a compelling picture however for those of you that I even the slightest bit squeamish even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends the lights are down this is a good time to look at your feet check your blackberry do anything other than look at the screen what I'm about to show you. what I'm about to show you is a diabetic ulcer and it's it's good to laugh before we look at this this is the reality of diabetes I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics. About to go we just don't connect the also with the eventual treatment which is a Tatian if you can't heal it so I'm going to put this light up now it won't be up for long this is a diabetic also it's it it's tragic the treatment for this is a Tatian this is an older lady she has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes and has decided to die with what's left of her body intact and this lady decided after a year of intensive treatment of that also that she would try this this new therapy that Steve invented that's what her wounds look like at 11 weeks later that material contained only natural signals. and that material in Juice the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn't have before it's going to be a couple more distressing slides for there is y'all I will let you know when you can look again this is the horse the horse is not in pain if it was in pain I wouldn't share either Slide the horse just has another nostril is developed because of a riding accident just a few weeks after treatment in this case is taking that material turning it into a gel and packing that area and then repeating the treatments a few times and the horse heals up and if you took an ultrasound of that area it would look great is a dolphin with a fence being reattach door now 400,000 patients around the world who have used that material to heal the wounds. could you regenerate to Lynn. They just gave Steve $15 to Lita eight institution project to begin the process of asking that question and I'll show you the 15 million dollar picture this is a 78 year old man who's lost the end of his fingertip remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips after treatments that's what it looks like. this is happening today this is clinically relevant today there are materials which do this Hot patches but could you go a little further could you say instead of using material can I take some cells along with the material and remove a damaged piece of tissue put put a biodegradable material on that you can see here a little bit of hot muscle beating in a dish this was done by through a condo at Tokyo women's hospital he can actually grow beets and tissue in a dish he kills the dish it changes its prophecies and he peels it right out of the dish coolest stuff. I'm going to show you so based regeneration and what I'm going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hits of the patient that again if you're squeamish you but you don't want to watch but this one's kind of cool. this is a this is a bypass operation just like what Al Gore had it with a difference in this case at the end of the bypass operation you're going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient and I'm standing up here because at one point I'm going to show you just how early this technology is he go to stem cells right into the Beating Heart of the patient if you look really carefully is going to be right around this point you'll actually see a backflush you see the cells coming back out we need also to new technology new devices to get the sauce to the right place at the right time. just a little bit of data that tiny bit of day to this was a randomized trial at this time this is was an aunt of 20 now there's an end of about a hundred basically if you take an extremely sick patients you give him a bypass to get a little bit better if you give them stem cells as well as that bypass for these particular patient's they became asymptomatic these are now two years out. the coolest thing would be as if you could diagnose the disease early and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad State this is the same procedure but now done minimally-invasive lie with only three holes in the body where they taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells to a laparoscopic procedure that goes ourselves we don't have time to go into all those details but basically that would you can take patients who are less sick and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic State through that kind of therapy is another example of stem cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet but I think very soon will be this is the work of Casey Mara from Pittsburgh along with a number of colleagues around the world they've decided that liposuction fluid which in the United States we have a lot of liposuction Florida. it's a great source of stem cells stem cells in that liposuction fluid so you could go and you could get your tummy tuck outcomes the life of suction fluid and in this case the stem cells are isolated incidents in neurons in the lab and I think fairly soon you will see patients being treated with their own fat derived or adipose-derived stem cells. I told before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease his just one example before I close up this is equally tragic we we have a very Abiding and and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at The Institute for surgical research in the US Army you have to treat the you now eleven thousand kids that have come back from Iraq many of those patients are very severely burned and it says anything that's being learned about bunnies that we don't know how to treat it everything that is done to treat burn basically we do a sodding approach we make something over here and then we transplanted onto the site of the wound and we try and get the two to take in this case it a new wearable bioreactor his being designed it should be tested clinically later this year old is our by yoga like in Pittsburgh and that buy back to will lay down in the wound bed the gun that you see that sprays sells that's going to spray cells over that area the reactor will serve to fertilize the environment deliver other things. as well at the same time and that's what we will see that long as opposed to try the sodding approaches a completely different way of doing it. semi 18 minutes is up so let me finish up with some good news and maybe a little bit of bad news. the good news is that this is happening today it's very powerful would clearly the images kind of get that across its incredibly difficult because it's highly into disciplinary almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen a number of governments and the number of regions have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease the Japanese government will perhaps the first when they decided to invest first three billion later another two billion in this field it's no coincidence Japan is the oldest country on Earth terms of its average age they need this to work or the health system dies so that putting a lot of Strategic investment focus in this area. European Union same thing China the same thing China just launched a national tissue engineering center the first year budget was 250 million US dollars in the United States we've had a somewhat different approach for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president being so just for the fun things as they come along that this be no Strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things too bad and focus them in a calf away I'm going to finish up with a quote or maybe a little cheap shots at at the director of the NIH has a very Charming Man went to visit with him and a number of his directives of his Institute just a few months ago to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that 20 some. 25 billion dollars that he's going to get next year and focus it in a strategic way to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients and at the end of a very testing meeting what the NIH director said is your vision is larger than our appetite I'd like to close by saying that no one's going to change out Vision but together we can change his appetite thank you",0.7447916865348816,
15,AlanSiegel_2010.sph.wav,i went one step further and said why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document let 's go online people might need help in computation working with the harvard business school you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment if you spent sixty two dollars for a meal the longer you take to pay out that loan you see over a period of time using the minimum payment it's ninety nine dollars and seventeen cents how about that do you think your bank is going to show that to people but it's going to work it's more effective than just computational aids and what about terms like over the limit perhaps a stealth thing define it in context tell people what it means when you put it in plain english changing the content and one of the things i'm most proud of is this agreement for ibm it's a grid it's so basically we have public leaders public officials who are out of control they are writing bills that are unintelligible and out of these bills are going to come maybe forty thousand pages of regulations total complexity at such and such a date ibm has responsibilities you have responsibilities received very favorably by business running through this typical letter that they had i ran it through my simplicity lab it's pretty unintelligible all the the document in red are not intelligible we looked at doing over one thousand letters that cover seventy percent of irs transactions in plain english they have been tested in the laboratory when i run it through my lab this heat mapping shows everything that is intelligible and the irs has introduced the program are a couple of things going on right now that i want to bring to your attention there is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency and how to mandate simplicity we see all this complexity no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate there is no way we should do business with companies that so how are we going to change the world make clarity transparency and simplicity a national priority which has a dramatically negative impact on our life if you're a veteran coming back from iraq or vietnam you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits if you're trying to get a small business loan you face a blizzard of paperwork what are we going to do about it i define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity transparency and empathy building humanity into communications i've been simplifying things for thirty years i come out of the advertising and design business my focus is understanding you people and how you interact with the government to get your benefits how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with and how you view brands so very quickly when president obama said i don't see why we can't have a one page plain english consumer credit agreement so i locked myself in a room figured out the content,1,so basically we have public leaders public officials who are out of control their writing bills that are unintelligible and out of these bills going to come maybe forty thousand pages of regulations total complexity which has a dramatically negative impact on our life if you're a veteran coming back from Iraq of Vietnam you place a blizzard paperwork to get your benefits if you're trying to get a small business loan you face a blizzard of paperwork or we going to do about it I Define Simplicity as a means to achieving Clarity transparency and empathy building Humanity into Communications I've been simplifying things for 30 years I come out of the out of the advertising and design business my focus is an understanding you people and how you interact with the government to get your benefits how you interact with corporations decide who you going to do business with and how you view brands. so very quickly when President Obama said I don't see why we can't have a one-page plain English Consumer Credit agreement so I locked myself in a room figured out the content organized a document and wrote it in plain English I've had this check by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country this is a real thing now as I want one step further and said why do we have to stick with this dodgy lawyers and just have a paper document let's go online so many people might need help in computation working with the Harvard Business School you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payments if you spend $62 for a meal the longer you take to pay out that loan you see over a. Of time using the minimum payment is set at $99.17 how about that you think your bank's going to show that to people but it's going to work it's more effective than just. rotational Age and what about terms like over the limit perhaps us tell Sing to find it in context tell people what it means when you put it in plain English you almost forcing institution to give the people a way I default out of that and not put themselves at risk plain English is about changing the content and one of the things I'm most proud of is a screaming for IBM it's a grid it's calendar at such-and-such a date ivmf responsibilities you have responsibilities received very favorably by by business and there's some good news to report today each year one in ten taxpayers receive a notice from the IRS their 200 million letters that go out running through this took the letter that they had I ran it through my Simplicity lab is pretty unintelligible all the parts of the document in red I'm not intelligible we looked at doing over a thousand letters that cover. 70% of the transactions are in plain English they've been tested in the laboratory when I run it through my lab this heat mapping shows everything is intelligible and the IRS has introduced the program. looking at apartments. that is why there are a couple of things going on right now that I'd want to bring to your attention there's a lot of discussion now about Consumer Financial Protection Agency how to mandate Simplicity we see all this complexity it's incumbent upon us and this organization I believe to make Clarity transparency and him to see a national priority there's no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate there's no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible so how we going to change the world make Clarity transparency in soon Simplicity a national priority I sent you,0.7682291269302368,"0.7578,0.7786"
16,AlexTabarrok_2009.sph.wav,i don't have to tell you the internet have come tumbling down and of course the iron curtains have come tumbling down now all of this has been tremendous for the world and perhaps most remarkably at the beginning of the twenty first century really for the first time in modern history growth extended to almost all parts of the world never before in human history have so many people been raised out of such great poverty as happened in china china is the world 's greatest anti poverty program over the last three decades africa has been the area of the world most resistant to growth and we can see the tragedy of africa in the first few bars here growth was negative we saw growth in africa and i think as you'll see there's reasons for optimism because i believe that the best is yet to come now why on the cutting edge today it's new ideas which are driving growth and by that i mean it's products for which the research and development costs are really high and the manufacturing costs are low the first world war more than ever before it is these types of ideas which are driving growth on the cutting edge now ideas have this amazing property the great depression the second world war and the rise of the communist nations as he who lights his candle at mine receives light without darkening me or to put it slightly differently one apple feeds one man but an idea can feed the world now this is not new this is practically not new to tedsters this is practically the model of ted what is new is that the greater function of ideas is going to drive growth even more than ever before this provides a reason why trade and globalization are even more important more powerful than ever before and are going to increase growth more than ever before and to explain why this is so i have a question suppose that there are two diseases one of them is rare the other one is common but if they are not treated they are equally severe if you had to choose which would you rather have the common disease or the rare disease common the common i think that's absolutely right why because there are more drugs to treat common diseases than there are to treat rare diseases the reason for this is incentives and each one of these forces split the world tore the world apart divided the world and they threw up walls it costs about the same to produce a new drug whether that drug treats one thousand people one hundred thousand people or a million people but the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people so the incentives are much larger to produce drugs which treat more people to put this differently larger markets save lives think about the following if china and india were as rich as the united states is today the market for cancer drugs would be eight times larger than it is now now we are not there yet but it is happening as other countries become richer the demand for these pharmaceuticals is going to increase tremendously and that means an increase incentive to do research and development which benefits everyone in the world action movies have larger budgets than comedies it's because action movies translate easier into other languages and other cultures so the market for those movies is larger people are willing to invest more and the budgets are larger alright well if larger markets increase the incentive to produce new ideas how do we maximize that incentive having one world market by globalizing the world the way i like to put this is one idea ideas are meant to be shared so one idea can serve one world one market political walls trade walls transportation walls communication walls iron curtains which divided peoples one idea one world one market can we create new ideas that's one reason trade how else can we create new ideas well more idea creators idea creators they come from all walks of life artists and innovators many of the people you've seen on this stage i'm going to focus on scientists and engineers because i have some data on that and i'm a data person now today less than one of one percent of the world 's population are scientists and engineers the u s is losing its idea leadership and for that i am very grateful that is a good thing it is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader because for too long the united states and a handful of other developed countries have shouldered the entire burden of research and development but consider the following if the world as a whole were as wealthy as the united states is now there would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers contributing ideas which benefit everyone which are shared by everyone i think of the great indian mathematician and nations it was only in the second half of the twentieth century that we slowly began to pull ourselves out of this abyss how many ramanujans are there in india today toiling in the fields barely able to feed themselves when they could be feeding the world now we're not there yet but it is going to happen in this century the real tragedy of the last century is this if you think about the world 's population as a giant computer a massively parallel processor then the great tragedy has been that billions of our processors have been off but in this century china is coming on line india is coming on line is coming on line we will see an einstein in africa in this century think what this means this means we all benefit when another country gets rich need a greater demand for ideas those larger markets i was talking about earlier and a greater supply of ideas for the world now you can see some of the reasons why i'm optimistic century than you expect to see in a year today trade walls began to come tumbling down here are some data on tariffs starting at forty percent coming down to less than five percent we globalized the world average gdp per capita in the world will be two hundred thousand dollars that's not u s gdp per capita which will be over a million but world gdp per capita two hundred thousand dollars that's not that far we won 't make it but some of our grandchildren probably will and i should say i think this is a rather modest prediction in kurzweilian terms this is gloomy growth alright what about problems what about a great depression well let 's take a look let 's take a look at the great depression we went off a cliff but we recovered in fact in the second half of the twentieth century growth was even higher than anything you would have predicted upon the first half of the twentieth century so growth can wash away even what appears to be a great depression that mean it means that we extended cooperation across national boundaries we made the world more alright what else oil oil this was a big topic when i was writing up my notes oil was one hundred and forty dollars per barrel so people were asking a question the were saying is china drinking our milkshake and there is some truth to this in the sense that we have something of a finite resource and moreover as everyone knows look it's energy not oil which counts and higher oil to overcome an increase in the price of oil today than ever in the past because of what i'm talking about one idea one world one market so i'm optimistic so long as we hew to these two ideas to keep globalizing world markets keep extending cooperation across national boundaries and keep investing in education now the united states has a particularly important role to play in this to keep our education system globalized to keep our education system open to students from all over the world because our education system is the candle that other students come to to light their own candles now remember here what jefferson said jefferson said when they come and light their candles at ours that they gain light and we are not darkened because the truth is so my view is be optimistic spread the ideas spread the light thank you today a container ship can carry one hundred and fifty thousand tons it can be manned with a smaller crew and unloaded faster than ever before,1,"the first half of the twentieth century was an absolute disaster in human Affairs a cataclysm we had the first world war the Great Depression the second world war and the rise of the Communist Nations and each one of these forces split the World Tour the World apart divided the world and the threw up walls political walls trade walls Transportation walls communication with iron curtains wish divided peoples and Nations. it was only in the second half of the twentieth century that we slowly began to pull ourselves out of this Abyss. sprayed walls began to come tumbling down here is some data on a Terra starting at 40% coming down to less than 5% we globalized the world and what does that mean it means that week standard cooperation across National boundaries we made the world more Cooperative Transportation walls came tumbling down you know in 1950 the typical ship carried five thousand to ten thousand tons worth of goods today at container ship can carry 150,000 tonnes it could be man to the smaller crew and unload it faster than ever before. communication walls I don't have to tell you the internet have come tumbling down and of course the iron curtains political walls have come tumbling down know all of this has been tremendous for the World Trade has increased here's just a little bit of data and 1990 exports from China to the United States fifteen billion dollars by 2007 over three hundred billion dollars and perhaps most remarkably at the beginning of the twenty-first century really for the first time in modern history growth expanded to almost all parts of the world so China I've already mentioned beginning around 1978 around the time of the death of Mel Rose 10% year on year after year after you're absolutely incredible. never before in human history have so many people been raised out of such great poverty as happened in China China is the world's greatest anti-poverty program of the last three decades India starting a little bit later but in 1990 be getting tremendous growth in comes at that time less than $1,000 for a year and over the next 18 years have almost tripled growth of 6% a year absolutely incredible now Africa sub-Saharan Africa sub-Saharan Africa has been the area of the world most resistant to grow and we can see the tragedy of Africa in the first few bars here growth with negative people were actually getting for dinner parents sometimes even poorer than their grandparents had been. but at the end of the twentieth century the beginning of the twenty-first century we song growth in Africa and I think as you'll see there's reasons for optimism because I believe that the best is yet to come now why on The Cutting Edge today its new ideas which are driving growth and by that I mean it's products for which the research and development costs are really high and the manufacturing costs are low more than ever before it is these types of ideas which are driving growth on The Cutting Edge now ideas have this amazing property Thomas Jefferson I think really Express is quite well he said he who receives an idea for me receives instruction himself without lasting mine as he who likes his candlelit mine. receive light without darkness in May. or to put it slightly differently when Applebee's one man but an idea can feed the world now this is not new this is practically not new to testers this is practically the model of Ted but what is new is that the greater function of ideas is going to drive growth and even more than ever before this provides a reason why trade and globalization are getting more important more powerful than ever before and are going to increase growth more than ever before and explain why this is so I have a question. suppose that there are two diseases one of them is rare the other one is coming but if they're not treated their equally severe if you have to choose which would you rather have the common disease or the rare disease. common the call and I think that's absolutely right and why because there are more drugs to treat common diseases and they're not hard to breed rare diseases and the reason for this is incentives it cost about the same to produce a new drug whether that drug treats a thousand people a hundred thousand people or million people but the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people so the incentives are much larger to produce drugs which treat more people to put this differently larger markets save lives in this case misery truly does love company now think about the following if China and India were as rich as the United States is today the market for cancer drugs would be 8 times larger than it is now. now we are not there yet but it is happening and as other countries become richer the demand for these Pharmaceuticals is going to increase to manually and that means an increase in Santa Fe to do research and development which benefits everyone in the world larger markets increased the incentive to produce all kinds of ideas and whether that software where there's a computer chip but there's a new design for the Hollywood people in the audience this even explains why action movies have larger budgets than comedies is because action movies translate easier into other languages and other cultures so the market for those movies is larger people are willing to invest more in the budgets or larger. all right we'll have larger markets increase the incentive to produce new ideas how do we maximize that incentive by having one World Market by globalize in the world in the way I like to put this is one idea ideas are meant to be shared so one idea conserve one world one market one idea one world one market. well how else could we create new ideas that's one reason globalize trade how else can we create new ideas one more idea creators Nadia creators they come from all walks of life are artists and innovators many of the people you've seen on the stage I'm going to focus on scientists and Engineers cuz I have some data on that and I'm a date a person now today less than one-tenth of 1% of the world's population are scientists and engineers. and United States has been an idea leader a large fraction of those people are in the United States what the US is losing its idea leadership and for that I'm very grateful that is a good thing it is a fortunate that we are becoming less of an ideal leader because for too long the United States and a handful of other developed countries have shoulder the entire burden of research and development but consider the following if the world is a whole world as wealthy as the United States is now there would be more than five times as many scientists and Engineers contributing to ideas which benefit everyone which are shared by everyone I think of the Great Indian mathematician Ramadan how many Romans John's are there in India today toiling in the fields barely able to feed themselves when they could be feeding the world. now we're not there yet but it is going to happen in this Century if you think that that's the real tragedy of the last century is this if you think about the world the world's population is a giant computer a massively parallel processor then the great tragedy has been that billions of our processors have been offline. but in this Century China is coming online India is coming online Africa is coming online we will see and Einstein in Africa in this century. he was just some data this is China 1996 less than 1 million new University students in China per year 2006 / 5 million. nothing but this means. it means we all benefit when another country gets Rich we should not fear other countries becoming wealthy that is something that we should embrace a wealthy China wealthy India wealthy Africa made a greater demand for ideas those larger markets I was talking about earlier and a greater supply of ideas for the world that you can see some of the reasons why I'm optimistic globalization is increasing the demand for ID is the incentive to create new ideas and investments in education are increasing the supply of new ideas. back if you look at the world history who can see some reasons for optimism from about the beginnings of humanity to 1500 0 economically growth nothing 1500 1800 maybe a little bit of economic growth but less in a century than you expect to see in a year today. 1900 maybe 1% 20th century little bit over 2% 21st century could easily be 3.3 even higher percent even at that rate by 2100 average GDP per capita in the world will be $200,000 that's not u.s. GDP per capita which will be over a million but world GDP per capita $200,000 that's not that far some of our summer we won't make it but some of our grandchildren probably will I should say I think this is a rather modest prediction in Cruz Whaley in terms of his gloomy you know if you and Chris Whalen turns on like the e or of you can on the growth. all right what about problems what about a Great Depression will let's take a look let's take a look at the Great Depression. here is GDP per capita from 1900 to 1929 and let's imagine that you are an economist in 1929 trying to forecast future growth for the United States not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster certainly in the twentieth century what would you have predicted not knowing this a few to base your prediction your forecast on 1919 29 you have predicted something like this if you'd been a little bit more optimistic say based upon the Roaring Twenties you just said this to what actually happened we went off a cliff but we recovered. and in fact in the second half of the 20th century growth was even higher than anything you would have predicted on the face upon the first half of the 20th century so gross even what appears to be a Great Depression all right what else this was a big topic when I was $140 per barrel and people were asking a question did they were saying you know is trying to drink a milkshake. and there is some truth there is some truth to this in the sense that you know we had something of a finite resource and it increased growth is going to push up to man for that but I think I don't have to tell you this audience at a higher price of oil is not just is not necessarily A Bad Thing more over as everyone knows look it's energy not oil which counts and higher oil prices mean a greater incentive to invest in energy R&D you can see this in the data as oil prices go up energy patterns go up you know the world is much better equipped to overcome an increase in the price of oil today than ever in the past because of what I'm talking about one idea one world one market. so I'm optimistic. so long as we're huge for these two ideas to keep globalizing World Markets keep extending cooperation across National boundaries and keep investing in education. now the United States has a particularly important role to play in this. to keep our education system globalized to keep our education system open to students from all over the world because our education system is the candle that other students come to to light their to light their own candles. remember hear what Jefferson said. Jefferson said when somebody when they come and light our candles and light their candles at ours vegan light and we are not darkened. Jefferson wasn't quite right was he. because the truth is. Lindsey light their candles at ours there's twice as much light available for everyone. so. my view is being optimistic read the ideas spread the light thank you",0.7434896230697632,
17,AlexisOhanian_2009I.sph.wav,to seventy percent at the end of voting which is pretty impressive right we won mister splashy pants was chosen hmm just kidding okay so greenpeace actually wasn't that crazy about it because they wanted one of their more thoughtful names to win so they said no no just kidding we'll give it another week of voting well that got us a little angry so we changed it to fightin splashy community really and the rest of the internet rather really got behind this facebook groups were getting created facebook applications were getting created the idea was vote your conscience vote for mister splashy pants and people were putting up signs in the real world about this whale is obvious it's a great name everyone wants to hear their news anchor say mister splashy pants and i think that's what helped drive this but what was cool was the repercussions now for greenpeace was they created an entire marketing campaign around it they sell mister splashy pants shirts and pins they even created an e card so you could send your friend a dancing splashy was even more important was the fact that they actually accomplished their mission the japanese government called off their whaling expedition mission accomplished greenpeace was thrilled the whales were happy that's a quote this wasn't really out of altruism this was just out of interest in doing something cool and this is kind of how the internet works this is that great big secret and one of the great lessons that greenpeace actually learned was that it's okay to lose control it's okay to take yourself a little less seriously given that even though it's a very serious cause you could ultimately achieve your final goal and that's the final message that i want to share with all of you that you can do well online but no longer is the message going to be coming from just the top down if you want to succeed you've got to be okay to just lose control thank you is actually about discovering new things that pop up on the web because in the last four years we've seen all kinds of memes all kinds of trends get born right on our front page on their whaling campaign these humpback whales were getting killed they wanted to put an end to it and one of the ways they wanted to do it was to put a tracking chip inside one of these humpback whales i believe this is a farsi word for immortal i think this means divine power of the ocean in a polynesian language and then there was this mister splashy pants and this this was special mister pants or splashy to his friends was very popular on the internet in fact someone on reddit thought oh what a great thing we should all vote this up and you know,1,do now they're a lot of Web 2.0 Consultants who make a lot of money if I can make their livings on this kind of stuff I'm going to try to save you all the time and all the money and go through the next 3 minutes so bear with me to go to website did you friends of mine called reddit.com that's what you call a social News website basically all that means is the Democratic front page of the best stuff on the web you find some interesting Concepts a TED talk to read it and grieve your peers will load up and feel like if I do damned if I don't. Creates the front page that was Rising falling always changing about half million people visit every day this isn't about Reddit is actually about discovering new things that pop up on the web because of the last four years we've seen all kinds of memes all kinds of trans get born right on my front page but this isn't even about humpback whales at 1 to stop Japanese government on their wailing campaign these humpback whales were getting killed they wanted it put into it and one of the way you wanted to do it was to put a tracking chip inside one of these humpback whales but they're really kind of personify the Moon. he wanted to name it soon true when fashion to put together a pole when it had a bunch of very erudite very thoughtful culture names I believe this is a Farsi word for Mortal I think this means divine power of the ocean in a Polynesian language is this mr. splashy pants. Oh what a great thing we should all do this up and then you know redditors responding and all all agreed so the voting started and we actually got behind it ourselves we changed our logo for the day from the alien to a splashy this would help the cause and it wasn't long before other side like fart and boing boing the rest of the internet started saying yes we'd love to wash your pants so it went from 5% which was when this meme started. do 70% at the end of voting actually wasn't that crazy about it because they wanted one of their more thoughtful names to win place another order just kidding we'll give it another week of voting well that got us a little angry so we changed routes are getting created Facebook application for getting creative vote your conscience vote for mr. flashy pants about this well and this is the final vote when did 70% of the landslide the next highest name pulled in three okay so there's a lesson here and I was at the internet and a mister splashy pants and I think that's what helped drive this. but what's even more important is the fact that they actually accomplish their mission Japanese government called out there willing Expedition mission accomplished Greenpeace was thrilled the whales were happy that's a quote. mmmm actually redditors and internet Community where they weren't whale lovers a few of them certainly were these came back on the site and thank ready for their participation this wasn't really out of altruism this was just out of interest in doing something cool and this is kind of how the internet works secret is yours as long as we have a browser anyone can go to any website how big a budget you have it is as long as we can keep net neutrality in place only take a few minutes of your time actually do something so cheap and if you do and it's okay to take yourself a little less seriously giving that even though it's a very serious cause you can ultimately achieve your final goal and that's that's the final message I want to share with all of you can do it online but no longer. just the top down if you want to succeed you copy okay just lose control thank you,0.77734375,
18,AliCarrChellman_2010X.sph.wav,for every one hundred girls with an emotional disturbance diagnosed we have three hundred and twenty four boys and by the way all of these numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black you happen to exist in an overcrowded school and if you are a four times as likely to be diagnosed with adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder now there is another side to this and it is important that we recognize that women still need help in school that salaries are still significantly lower even when controlled for job types and that girls have continued to struggle in math and science for years that's all true nothing about that prevents us from paying attention to the literacy needs of our boys between ages three and thirteen and so we

fantastic they've done a lot of good for girls in these situations so i'm here to tell you that we have a problem with boys and we ought to be thinking about how we can make that happen for boys too in their younger years we may be getting close to seventy percent female population in universities this makes university administrators very nervous because girls don't want to go to schools that don't have boys and it's a serious problem with boys we're starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university if you talk to faculty they may say well they're playing video games and they're gambling online all night long and they're playing world of warcraft and that's affecting their academic their culture isn't working in schools and i'm going to share with you ways that we can think about overcoming that problem guess what video games are not the cause video games are a symptom they were turned off a long time before they got here so let 's talk about why they got turned off when they were between the ages of three and thirteen there are three reasons that i believe that boys are out of sync with the culture of schools today and when he did she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns you can't have plastic knives and swords and axes and all in a kindergarten classroom what is it that we're afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun i mean really but here he stands as testament to the fact that you can't roughhouse on the playground today now i'm not advocating for bullies i'm not suggesting that we need to be allowing guns and knives into school but when we say that an eagle scout in a high school classroom to start by saying this is a to write poems and little moments in my life i don't want to write that stuff and this is a girl and this is probably stereotypically what you think of as a boy and a girl if i essentialize gender for you today then you can dismiss what i have to say so i'm not going to do that i'm not interested in doing that well what do you want to write what do you want to write about i want to write about video games i want to write about leveling up i want to write about this really interesting world i want to write about the answer is no he 's just a boy he 's just a little boy it's not okay to write these kinds of things in classrooms today there are fewer male teachers anybody who 's over fifteen doesn't know what this means because in the last ten years the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half now what's the problem with this women are great yep absolutely but male role models for boys that say it's all right to be smart they've got dads they've got pastors they've got cub scout leaders but ultimately six hours a day five days a week they're spending in a classroom and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist and so they say i guess this really isn't a place for boys teachers lounge and they're having a conversation about this is a different kind of boy and a different kind of girl so the point here is that not all boys exist within these rigid boundaries of what we think of as boys and girls you'll see the conversation changes depending upon who 's sitting around the table third reason that boys are out of sync with school today kindergarten is the old second grade folks we have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there in first grade you should be able to read paragraphs of with maybe a picture maybe not in a book of maybe twenty five to thirty pages if you don 't we're probably going to be putting you into a title one special reading program and if you ask title one teachers they'll tell you they've got about four or five boys for every girl that's in their program in the elementary grades is because the message that boys are getting is you need to do what the teacher asks you to do all the time the teacher 's salary depends on no child left behind and race to the top and accountability and testing and all of this so she has to figure out a way and so this is a very serious problem where is it coming from it's coming from we want to live in lake wobegon where every child is above average but what this does to our children is really not healthy it's not developmentally appropriate and it's particularly bad for boys need to meet them where they are we need to put ourselves into boy culture we need to change the mindset of acceptance in boys in elementary schools very specific things we can design better games most of the educational games that are out there are really flashcards they're glorified drill and practice they don't have the depth the rich narrative that really engaging video games have that the boys are really interested in so we need to design better games all of those conversations need to be happening there are some great examples out there of schools the new york times just talked about a school recently a game designer from the new school put together a wonderful video gaming school it only treats a few kids and so this isn't very scalable we have to change the culture and the feelings that politicians and school board members and parents have about the way we accept and what we accept in our schools today we have to find more money for game design because good games really good games cost money and world of warcraft has quite a budget most of the educational games do not the point is that for boys the way that they exist and the culture that they embrace isn't working well in schools now how do we know that and we discovered that they talk about the kids in their school who talk about gaming in pretty demeaning ways they say oh yeah they're always talking about that stuff they're talking about their little action figures and their little nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tolerance policies they are sure that parents and administrators will never accept anything so we really need to think about looking at teacher attitudes and finding ways to change the attitudes so that teachers are much more open and accepting of boy cultures in their classrooms because ultimately if we don have boys who leave elementary school saying you the one hundred girls project tells us some really nice statistics for example for every one hundred girls that are suspended from school there are two hundred and fifty boys that are suspended from school for every one hundred girls who are expelled from school there are three hundred and thirty five boys who are expelled from school for every one hundred girls in special education there are two hundred and seventeen boys for every one hundred girls with a learning disability there are two hundred and seventy six boys,1,so I'm here to tell you that we have a problem with boys and it's a serious problem with voice their culture isn't working in schools and I'm going to share with you ways that we can think about overcoming that problem first I want to start by saying this is a boy and this is a girl and this is probably stereotypically what you think of as a boy and a girl if I essentialized for you today then you can dismiss what I have to say so I'm not going to do that I'm not interested in doing that this is a different kind of boy and a different kind of girl right so the point here is that not all boys exist Within These rigid boundaries of what we think of his boys and girls and not all girls exist within those rigid boundaries of what we think of as girls but in fact most boys tend to be a certain way and the point is that for boys the way that they exist in the culture that they Embrace isn't working well in schools now how do we know that the 100 girls project. and some really nice to 264 example from school they're 250 boys that are suspended from school for a 335 boys who were expelled from school for everyone at a girl's in special education there are 217 boys for every 100 girls with a learning disability there are two hundred and Seventy-Six boys for every 100 girls with an emotional disturbance diagnosed we have 324 boys and by the way all of these numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black or if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school and if you are a boy or four times as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. there is another side to this and it is important that we recognize that women still need help in school that salaries are still significantly lower even when control for job types and the girls have continued to struggle in math and science for years. that's all true nothing about that prevents us from paying attention to the literacy needs of our boys between ages 3 and 13. and so we should in fact what we got to do is take a page from their playbook because the initiatives and programs that have been set in place for women in science and engineering and Mathematics are fantastic they've done a lot of good for girls in these situations and we already thinking about how we can make that happen for boys to in their younger years. even in their older years what we find is that there's still a problem when we look at the University 60% of baccalaureate degrees are going to women now which is a significant shift and in fact University administrators are a little uncomfortable about the idea that getting close to 70% female population and universities this makes me nervous to minister to the very nervous because girls don't want to go to schools that don't have boys. and so we're starting to see the establishment of men centers and then studies to think about how do we engage man in their experiences any of the University's faculty they may well they're playing video games and they're playing World of Warcraft and that's affecting their academic achievements right. guess what video games are not the cause for your games are a symptom they were turned off a long time before they got here so let's talk about why they got turned off when they were between the ages of 3 and 13 there are three reasons that I believe that boys are out of sync with the cultural school today the first a zero-tolerance kindergarten teacher I know her son donated all of his toys to her and when he did she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns. right you can't have plastic knives and swords and axes and all that kind of thing in the kindergarten classroom what is it that were afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun I mean really but here he stands as a testament to the fact that you can't Rough House on the playground today no not advocating for Phillies I'm not suggesting that we need to be you know allowing guns and knives into school when we say that a an eagle scout in the high school classroom has a lock parked car in the parking lot and a penknife in it has to be suspended from school I think we may have gone a little too far with zero tolerance another way than zero tolerance is itself out as in the writing of voice in a lot of classrooms today about anything that has to do with video games these topics are banned Boy comes home from school and he says. I hate writing I hate riding son what's wrong with writing now I have to write what she tells me the right okay well what is she telling you to write how to write poems little moments in my life I don't want to write that stuff. well what do you want to write what do you want to write about I want to write about video games I want to write about leveling up I want to read about this really interesting world I want to write about a tornado that comes into our house and close all the windows and kills everybody okay you tell the teacher that and they'll ask you in all seriousness should we send this child to the psychologist. any answers now he's just a boy he's just a little boy right it's not okay to write these kinds of things in classrooms today so that's the first reason zero-tolerance policies in the way they lived out the next reason that boys cultures are out of sync with school cultures there are fewer male teachers anybody who's over 15 doesn't know what this means because of the last 10 years since elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half we went from 14% to 7% that means that 93% of the teachers that are young men getting Elementary classroom are women all right now what's the problem of this right when are great yep that solutely but male role models for boys but say it's alright to be smart they got. They got pastors they've got Cub Scout leaders But ultimately 6 hours a day 5 days a week they're spending in a classroom. and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist and so they say I guess this really isn't a place for boys this is a place for girls and I'm not very good at this so I guess I'd better let you know don't play video games or get into sports or something like that because I obviously don't belong here belong here that's pretty obvious so that may be a very direct way that we see it happen but left directly the lack of male presence in the culture you got two Teachers Lounge and then having a conversation about Joey and Johnny who beat each other up on the playground what are we going to do with these boys the answer that question changes depending on who's sitting around that table are there men around that table other moms do for his boys around that table you'll see that the conversation changes depending upon who's sitting on the table. third reason that boys are out of sync with school today kindergarten is the old second grade folks we have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there when your 3 you better be able to write your name like to play or else will considered a developmental delay. by the time you're in first grade you should be able to read paragraphs of text with maybe a picture maybe not in a book of maybe 25 to 30 pages if you don't we're probably give you putting you into a title one special reading program if you ask title one teacher they'll tell you they got about four or five boys for me girl that's in their program in the Elementary grades. the reason why this is a problem. is because the message that boys are getting is you need to do but the teacher asks you to do all the time alright the teacher's salary depends on No Child Left Behind and race to the top and accountability and testing and and all this so she has to figure out a way to get all these boys through his curtain and girls. this compressed perch on the side for all active. and what happens if she says please sit down be quiet do what you're told all the rules manage your time focused be a girl. so she tells them indirectly that's what she tells him and so this is a very serious problem where is it coming from it's coming from us. we want our babies to read when they are six months old have you seen the ad we want to live in Lake Wobegon where every child is about average right but what this does to our children is really not healthy it's not developmentally appropriate is particularly bad for boys. so what are we doing we need to meet them where they are we need to put ourselves into boyculture we need to change the mindset of Acceptance in boys in elementary school. what specifically we can do some very specific things we can design better games that are out there today are really flashcards glorified drill in practice they don't have the death of Rich narrative that really engaging video games have that the boys are really interested in so we need to design better games we need to talk to teachers and parents and school board members and politicians need to make sure that people see that we need more men in the classroom we need to look carefully at our zero-tolerance policies do they make sense we need to think about how to uncompress this curriculum if we can trying to bring boys back into a space that is comfortable for them all of those conversations need to be happening there are some great examples out there schools that the New York Times just talked about a school recently is a designer from The Young video gaming school and so this is a really very scalable we have to chain. the culture and the feelings that politicians and school board members and parents have about the way we accept and what we except in our schools today. we need five more money for game design because good games really good games cost money in World of Warcraft has quite a budget most of the educational games do not. where we started my colleagues might partner Sean Vachon myself we started back trying to look at the teachers attitude and find out how did they really feel about gaming what do they say about it and we discovered that they talk about the kids in their school who talked about gaming and pretty demeaning ways they say a little action figures and their little butt shipments are merit badges are always talking about this it's okay but if I feel it's very uncomfortable to be on the receiving end of that kind of language they are nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero-tolerance policies they were sure that parents and administrators never accept anything so we really need to think about looking at teacher attitudes and finding ways to change the attitudes so that teachers are much more open and an accepting a boy cultures in her class. because ultimately if we don't know where that boy to leave Elementary School saying it wasn't for me you know so I've got it I've got to do gaming I've got to Just Sports if we change these things if we pay attention to these things and weary and dates boys and their learning they will leave the elementary school saying I'm smart thank you.

19,AlisonJackson_2005G.sph.wav,the real person which is highly embarrassing i've also been working with the guardian on a topical basis a page a week views on gordon brown which i find very interesting condi and bush this image i've decided to show having a reservation about it i made it a year ago and just how meanings change and a terrible thing that has happened but the fear is lurking around in our minds prior to that that's why this image was made one year ago and what it means today so i'll leave you with these clips to,1,I'm a contemporary artists to my show in Galleries and museums my show number of photographs and films but I also make television programs books and some appetizing full with the same concept and it's about a fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture and the importance of the image celebrity's phone of Photography so I'm going to start with how I started with this concept seven years ago when Princess Diana died there was a Sim stand still in Britain of the day with the moment of her death on people decided to mourn her death in a sort of mass way I was fascinated by this evening if Diana actually quite cruelly and physically so I don't have gum and started to shoot at the image of Diana I couldn't erase this from. memory and sucking it was not being ready for the soda public psyche momentum was being billed the Press wrote about her death in Rolla kind of I felt pornographic ways like which was of archery Leftwich been afforded him how did she die in the back of the car and I was intrigued by this such a math voyeurism so I submit these are all the glory images wondering whether I can actually replace her image so I go to look like Diana run poster in the right positions and angles and. create something that was in the existed in the public imagination to people wondering what she can to Mary Dougherty was she in love with him but she pregnant. She wants his baby was she pregnant when she died so I created this image of Diana Jody and Hitmonchan remix raise a child and the same age came out which caused a huge Publix at the time I then went home to so to make a comment on the media and press imagery so started making reference to meet her in a tree made it raining in short to do away with the public Camila kissing her husband and this was a sequence that image is this get shown into the galleries like this out of sequence and. I didn't baby imagery this is another Art Gallery installation I'm particularly interested in how you can't rely on your end session so this is Jaden Smith gay blogs for instance that you think his commander in the queen and I'm fascinated how what you think is real isn't necessarily real and the camera can lie and it makes it very very easy with some of the mass of a bob bunch of imagery to tell truths so I continued to work on this project of Photography seduces off and it's more interesting to look at then the actual real subject matter and at the same time it removes us from the real subject matter and this. sing so the photograph becomes is so just cheese and insights and voyeurism like what you can't have you won't bolso in the photograph of the real subject doesn't exist so it makes you want that person wool and that is the way I think it is celebrity magazines work now that the pictures you see of these celebrities the more you feel you know them but you don't know them and you want to know them for that often to what your horses. then I threw making imagery if I in England as an expression you can't imagine Queen on the blue so I'm trying trying to set up an of trait that damage was creating a lot of fuss and I was cited as a disgusting and depressed when giving full pages about how terrible this was trying to find interesting is that it was going kind of full cycle I was taking making comments about the press in about how we know some information only by media because we don't know the real people we have very few of us know the real people in my filthy what so you know decent broadsheets tabloids debate swimming hide all about this what films were being burned before people that actually have to look at the work politicians. involves a great headline then suddenly it started to get on the front pages if it's acceptable which I found a turtle headlines about me but then they changed. suddenly I then started to what for magazines and newspapers this was pretty that went into this was another newspaper image it was an April Fool actually sent to the state some people think it's real so I was exploring at the time that the hyperbole of icons and Zion are in Maryland in the importance of celebrity in our lives we do that way into are the collective psyche when I can't even knowing you know how that should happen I explode without dressing up as the celebrities myself look like a sweater in Myra hindley I think. school and trying to text late by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth and then he's shutting certain angles to create the reality that obviously completely constructed this is looking like so the crofting out of months of this is a be completely enormous she looks nothing like Marilyn but by the time we made her off and put wigs and makeup on but she looks exactly like Maryland $0.06 but her husband couldn't recognize the photographs should I find it quite interesting listen to. this book but it was a real legal problem because it looks real but how do you get over that it's making a comment about the culture right right now that we come tell what's real how do we know what we're looking at something whether it's real or not so. from my point of view it's important to publish it for the same time it does Kohl's of a confusion intention on my behalf but problematic so so need a big display me to put on everything that I do and I made sort of narratives about the sort of European celebrities and comments about the public figures. you know what does tiny black I talked to in private with his passion and also dealing with the perceptions that are put to buy out about you know I've been inside of me saying he had the links to a post about pre-war and what is going to happen to the Moana cake because you know obviously I mean the British public I think with the phone with him to Charles on the throne and show that desire that I suppose I'm dealing with my work I'm not really interested in the celebrity themselves I'm interested in the the perception of the celebrity Summit up like that so good that you don't know about us every little noise I did the advertising campaign. The witch is Coca-Cola. and so that was very interesting intensive than the galaxies is highly commercial it was a difficult for me because this thing at the time so. I made sure the word was not compromised in any way and that the Integrity of the what remained the same but the meanings changed in the sense that you know with the logo on your closing all the lines of interpretation done to selling a product and that's all you're doing and you take the logo off you opening up the interpretations and making the word inconclusive the Post-it conclusive when when you are a time thing this image is quite interesting actually because I think we made it three years ago and it's come in her in her wedding dress and which we use now to her wedding Tony Blair and Sherry and so you know it's not really that. put up on the side of the imagery and Margaret Thatcher a series of Windows Photo so I built a suitable than one of the windows and created little scenes live scenes with look like inside the window in the windows are steamed up its Tony Blair reading and practicing a speech I've got them doing yoga inside the with Carol Thompson that's been making out with ulrika jonsson who he's having an affair with. That time this was a huge success for them because the imagery got shown in the press the day after and every single newspaper some tabloids it's a bit of a roadster which ship was a problematic because the police kept on trying to sort of clear way the crowds but the huge fun it was great for me to do a performance. also people were taking photographs of this so it's being texted around the wells extremely quickly oldest imagery and the Press was interviewing a funny my book so I could have Global Market my previous but was I need for the UK Market that I suppose could be cooled kind of like humorous humorous intent and then something in my work is funny and I think it doesn't really matter the my work is considered humorous anyway I think it's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery and how we read all our information through in a drink it's extremely fast way of getting information. it's extremely difficult if it's constructed correctly in their techniques of constructing iconic imagery I mean this image for example is so spot-on if you know because it's exactly something else and maybe doing in private and also what might be happening and with that in the saying and George Bush reading the Koran upside down for example target practice shooting it to Bin Laden of Michael Moore then you change the photography shooting at and it suddenly becomes through all the Grimm I may be less accessible. Tony Blair when used to mounting block and Rumsfeld and Bush laughing with some Abu ghraib photos behind and the seriousness of the whole day in tonight to Bush and also commenting on the behind-the-scenes role as we know now what goes on in prisons and in fact your bushy tail and having great fun during all of us and the celebrities might be up to in his celebrity life and the fact that he tried to catch a bit of road rage and golf club a driver the other day I mean it's extremely difficult to find these look like that I'm constantly going out to people in the street and I trying to ask people to come. being one of my face girl so films and sometimes asking the real celebrity mistaking them for someone who just looks like the real path in which is highly embarrassing Guardian so on the topical basis page week in the newspaper which is being very interesting working topically so Jamie Oliver schools in us-russian plan on having difficulty getting along side a Muslim culture the whole of the hunting issue and the royal family refusing to stop hunting and tsunami issues and they hiring. bless views on the Golden Bee reservation about it I made a year ago and just how meanings change and it was a terrible thing that has happened but the Fizz looking around and I Minds prior to that that's why this image was made one year ago and you know what it means to today so I'll leave you with these damn cats to have a look.can you call Mom.maybe Brazilian,0.6744791865348816,"0.6745,0.6745"

21,AndersYnnerman_2010X.sph.wav,we're seeing this it's beginning a technology trend that's happening right now is that we're starting to look at time result situations as well so we're getting the dynamics out of the body as well and just assume that we will be collecting data during five seconds and that would correspond to one terabyte of data that's eight hundred thousand books and sixteen km of phone books that's one patient one data set and this is what we have to deal with so this is really the enormous challenge that we have and already today this is twenty five thousand images imagine the days when we had radiologists doing this they would put up twenty five thousand images they would go like this twenty five zero okay okay there is the problem they can't do that anymore that's impossible so we have to do something that's a little bit more intelligent than doing this so what we do is we put all these slices together imagine that you slice your body in all these directions and then you try to put the slices back together again into a pile of data into a block of data start by posing a little bit of a challenge the challenge of dealing with data data that we have to deal with in medical so this is really what we're doing so this gigabyte or terabyte of data we're putting it into this block but of course the block of data just contains the amount of x ray that's been absorbed in each point in the human body so what we need to do is to figure out a way of looking at the things we do want to look at and make things transparent that we don't want to look at so transforming the data set into something that looks like this and this is a challenge this is a huge challenge for us to do that using computers even though they're getting faster and better all the time it's a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data terabytes of data and extracting the relevant information i want to look at the heart i want to look at the blood vessels i want to look at the liver maybe even find a tumor in some cases so this is where this little dear comes into play this is my daughter this is as of nine zero am this morning she's playing a computer game she's only two years old and she's having a blast so she's really the driving force behind the development of graphics processing units as long as kids are playing computer games graphics is getting better and better and better so please go back home tell your kids to play more games because that's what i need so what's inside of this machine is what enables me to do the things that i'm doing with the medical data so really what i'm doing is using these fantastic little devices and you know going back maybe ten years in time when i got the funding to buy my first graphics computer it was a huge machine it was cabinets of processors and storage and everything i paid about one million dollars for that machine that machine is today about as fast as my so every month there are new graphics cards coming out and here is a few of the latest ones from the vendors nvidia ati intel is out there as well and you know for a few hundred bucks you can get these what we can do this is a data set that was captured using a ct scanner you can see that this is a full data it's a woman you can see the hair you can see the individual structures of the woman you can see that there is scattering of x rays on the teeth the metal in the teeth that's where those artifacts are coming from but fully interactively on standard graphics cards on a normal computer i can just put in a clip plane and of course all the data is inside so i can start rotating i can look at it from different angles and i can see that this woman had a problem she had a bleeding up in the brain and that's been fixed with a little stent a metal clamp that's tightening up the vessel it's a fantastic device it uses x rays x ray beams that are rotating very fast around the human body it takes about thirty seconds to go through the whole machine and just by changing the functions then i can decide what's going to be transparent and what's going to be visible i can look at the skull structure and i can see that okay this is where they opened up the skull on this woman and that's where they went in so these are fantastic images they're really high resolution and they're really showing us what we can do with standard graphics cards today now we have really made use of this and we have tried to squeeze a lot of data into the system and one of the applications that we've been working on and this is gotten a little bit of traction worldwide is the application of virtual autopsies so again looking at very very large and you saw those full body scans that we can do we're just pushing the body through the whole ct scanner and just in a few seconds we can get a full body data set so this is from a virtual and you can see how i'm gradually peeling off first you saw the body bag that the body came in then i'm peeling off the skin you can see the muscles and eventually you can see the bone structure of this woman now at this point i would also like to emphasize that with the greatest respect for the people that i'm now going to show i'm going to show you a few cases of so it's with great respect for the people that have died under violent circumstances that i'm showing these pictures to you in the forensic case and this is something that there's been approximately four hundred cases so far just in the part of sweden that i come from that has been undergoing virtual autopsies in the past four years so this will be the typical work flow situation the police will decide in the evening when there's a case coming in they will decide okay is this a case where we need to do an autopsy so in the morning and is generating enormous amounts of information that comes out of the machine so this is a fantastic machine that we can use for improving health care seven in the morning the body is then transported inside the body bag to our center and is being scanned through one the the ct scanners and then the radiologist together with the pathologist and sometimes the forensic scientist looks at the data that's coming out and they have a joint session and then they decide what to do in the real physical now looking at a few cases here 's one of the first cases that we had you can really see the details of the data set it's very high resolution and it's our algorithms that allow us to zoom in on all the details and again it's fully interactive so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here without saying too much about this case this is a traffic accident a drunk driver hit a woman here 's another case a knifing and this is also again showing us what we can do it's very easy to look at metal artifacts that we can show inside of the body you can also see some of the artifacts from the teeth that's actually the filling of the teeth but because i've set the functions to show me metal and make everything else transparent but as i said it's also a challenge for us and the challenge is really found in this picture here it's the medical data explosion that we're having right now it's very easy to see how air has been leaking from one part to another part which is difficult to do in a normal standard physical autopsy so it really really helps the one of the things that i'm really really happy to be able to show you here today is our virtual autopsy table it's a touch device that we have developed based on these algorithms using standard graphics gpu 's it actually looks like this just to give you a feeling for what it looks like it really just works like a huge so we've implemented all the gestures you can do on the table and you can think of it as an enormous touch interface so if you were thinking of buying an ipad forget about it this is what you want instead steve i hope you're listening to this so it's a very nice little device so if you have the opportunity please try it out it's really a hands on experience so it's gained some traction and we're trying to roll this out and trying to use it for educational purposes but also perhaps in the future in a more clinical situation there's a youtube that you can download and look at this if you want to convey the information to other people about virtual okay now that we're talking about touch let me move on to really touching data and this is a bit of science fiction now so we're moving into really the future this is not really what the medical doctors are using right now but i hope they will in the future so what you're seeing on the left is a touch device it's a little mechanical pen that has very very fast step motors inside of the and so i can generate a force feedback so when i virtually touch data it will generate touch forces in the pen so i get a feedback so in this particular situation it's a scan of a living person i have this pen and i look at the data and i move the pen towards the head and all of a sudden i feel resistance so i can feel the skin if i push a little bit harder i'll go through the skin and i can feel the bone structure inside if i push even harder i'll go through the bone structure especially close to the ear where the bone is very soft and then i can feel the brain inside and this so this is really nice and to take that even further this is a heart and this is also due to these fantastic new scanners that just in zero point three seconds i can scan the whole heart and i can do that with time resolution so just looking at this heart i can play back a video here and this is karljohan one of my graduate students who 's been working on this project and he 's sitting there in front of the haptic device the force feedback system and he 's moving his pen towards the heart and the heart is now beating in front of him so he can see how the heart is beating he 's taken the pen and he 's moving it towards the heart and he 's putting it on the heart and then he feels the heartbeats from the real living patient then he can examine how the heart is moving he can go inside push inside of the heart and really feel how the valves are moving go inside of the patient 's heart before you actually do surgery and do that with high quality resolution data so this is really neat we're going even further into science fiction and we heard a little bit about functional mri now this is really an interesting project is using magnetic fields and radio frequencies to scan the brain or any part of the body so what we're really getting out of this is information the structure of the brain but we can also measure the difference in magnetic properties of blood that's oxygenated and blood that's depleted of oxygen that means that it's possible to map out the activity of the brain taken the liberty just for clarity to translate that to data slices that would correspond to about fifty mb of data which is small so this is something that we've been working on and you just saw motts the research engineer there going into the mri system and he was wearing goggles so he could actually see things in the goggles so i could present things to him in the scanner and this is a little bit freaky because what motts is seeing is actually this he 's seeing his own brain so motts is doing something here and probably he is going like this with his right hand because the left side is activated on the motor cortex and then he can see that at the same time these visualizations are brand new and this is something that we've been researching for a little while this is another sequence of motts brain and here we asked motts to calculate backwards from one hundred so he 's going one hundred ninety seven ninety four and then he 's going backwards and you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain and is lighting up the whole brain well this is fantastic we can do this in real time we can investigate things we can tell him to do things you can also see that his visual cortex is activated in the back of the head and in just a second here you will see okay here motts now move your left foot so he 's going like this for twenty seconds he 's going like that and all of a sudden it lights up up here so we've got motor cortex activation up so this is really really nice and i think this is a great tool and connecting also with the previous talk here this is something that we could use as a tool to really understand how the neurons are working how the brain is working and we can do this with very very high visual quality and very fast resolution you think about the data we can handle today just on normal mobile devices if you translate that to phone books it's about one meter of phone books in the now we're also having a bit of fun at the center so this is a cat scan computer aided tomography so this is a lion from the local zoo outside of norrkoping in kolmarden elsa so she came to the center and we've been experimenting with this and i think this is a great application for the future of this technology because there's very little known about the animal anatomy so with that i'd like to thank all the people that have helped me to generate these images it's a huge effort that goes into doing this gathering the data and developing the algorithms writing all the software so some very talented people my motto is always i only hire people that are smarter than i am and most of these are smarter than i am so thank you very much,1,"I will start by posting a little bit of a challenge the challenge of dealing with data data that we have to deal with in and medical situations it's really a huge challenge for us and this is our Beast of Burden this is a computer tomography machine c&t machine it's a fantastic device that uses x-rays x-ray beams that are rotating the tallest around the human body facts about 30 seconds to go through the whole machine and it's generating an enormous amount so all the information that comes out of the machine so this is a fantastic machine that we can use for improving Healthcare but I said it's also a challenge for us and the challenge is really found in this picture here it it's bent the medical data explosion that we having right now replacing this problem and let me step back in time but let's just go back a few years in time and see what happened back then these machines that came out they started coming in the 1970s they would scan off. and that would generate about 100 images of the human body I've taken the Liberty just for clarity to translate that to data sizes that will correspond to about 60 MB of data it's more when you think about the day that we can handle today just don't know normal mobile devices if you translate that's two phone books it's about 1 L of phone books in the pile looking at what we doing today with these machines that we have we can just in a few seconds get 24,000 images out of the building and that will correspond to about 20 GB of data or 800 phone books on the pot with a 200 lb box what's about to happen I received this at the beginning at technology trend is happening right now is that we starting to look at time-resolved situations as well so we getting the Dynamics out of the body as well I just assumed that we will be collecting data during 5 seconds and I will correspond to what one terabyte of data and that's eight hundred thousand books and 16th. how much does a phone books does one patient one dataset and this is what we have to deal with. this is really the enormous challenge that we have 25,000 images you know imagine that the days when we had radiologist that will put up 25000 25000 okay okay there there is the problem right they can't do that anymore that's impossible so we have to do something that's a little bit more intelligent than doing this. so what we do is that we put all these classes together imagine that you slice your body and all these directions and then you try to put the pieces back together again into a pile of data into a block of data so this is really what we doing so this Gap is a terabyte of data be putting into this block but of course the block of data just contains the amount of X-ray that's been absorbed in each point in the unibody so what we need to do is to figure out a way of looking at the things that we do want to look at it and make things transparent that we don't want to look at so transforming today to set into something that looks like this and this is a challenge to do that using computers even though they're getting faster and better all the time it's a challenge to deal with GB of data terabytes of data and extracting the relevant information I want to look at the heart I want to look at the blood vessels I want to look at the liver may be in finding the tumor and and and in some cases. so this is where this little dude comes into play this is my daughter this is that as of 9 a.m. this morning she's playing a computer game she's only two years old and I just having a blast so she's really they are the driving force behind the development of Graphics processing units. as long as kids do playing computer games Graphics is getting better and better and better so please go back home tell the kids to play more games because that's what I need so what's inside of this machine is what enables me to do the things that I'm doing for the medical data what I'm doing is using these fantastic little devices and you know going back maybe ten years in time when I go to the funding to buy my first Graphics computer it was a huge machine that it was cabinets of processor is in storage and everything I thought about 1 million dollars for that machine that machine is today about as fast as my iPhone. so every month there and you got these cars coming out in here is the few of the latest ones from from the vendors and Nvidia ATI until he's out there as well so you can get and get these things and put them into your computer and you can do fantastic things with these graphics card so this is really what's enabling us to deal with the explosion of data in medicine together with some really Nifty work in terms of compressing data extraction the relevant information that people are doing research on so I'm going to show you a few examples of what we can do that was captured using a CT scanner you can say this is a full data it's a it's a woman that you can see the hair you can see the individual structures and of the woman you can see that there is scattering of X-rays and more on the teeth to Mitchell in the TS that's so sweet those artifacts are coming from fully interactive Leon standard graphics card so I don't know normal computer I can just put in a complaint and of course all the. because inside so I can start rotating I can look at it from different angles and I can see that this woman had a problem that was that she had a bleeding up in the brain and that's been fixed with a little stand metal clamp test typing up the vessel and just by changing the functions and I can decide what's going to be transparent and what's it going to be visible I can look at the the skull structure and I can see that okay this is where they open up the Scotland this woman and that's why they went in so they said fantastic images of really high resolution and that really showing us what we can do with it with standard graphics cards today now we have really made use of this and we have tried to squeeze a lot of data into the system and one of the applications that we've been working on it this is Scott a little bit of traction worldwide is the application of the ocean. Seuss full body scans that we can do we just pushing the body through the whole CT scanner I just need a few seconds we can get it. so this is one of those people to see and you can see how I gradually peeling off Thursday so the body bag that the body came in. I'm feeling of the skin you can see the muscles and eventually you can see the bone structure on all this woman with the greatest respect for the people that I'm not going to show I'm going to show you a few cases of electrical tips is so it's a great respect for the people that have died on the violent circumstances that I'm showing these pictures to you. in the transfer case and and this is something that has been approximately 400 cases so far just in the importance of being that I come from that has been undergoing go to do to assist in the past 4 years so this will be a difficult work flow situation the police will decide in the evening when there's a case coming and I will decide okay this is a case where we need to do an autopsy so in the morning between 6 and 7 in the morning the body's been transported inside of the body bag to Eye Center and is being scammed through one of the city's counters and then the radiologist together and sometimes the forensic scientist at the title coming out and I have a joint session and then I decide what to do in the real physical also see after that. now looking at a few cases he was one of the first cases that we had you can really see the details of the data set is very high resolution and it's our algorithms that allow us to zoom in on all the details and it again is fully interactive so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time and the systems here without saying too much about this case this is a traffic accident drunk driver that hit a woman and is very very easy to see the damages on the bone structure and the cause of death is the broken neck and this woman was on ended up under the car and so she's quite badly beaten up by and buy the things. it's not the case and icing and this is also again showing us what we can do it's very easy to look at metal artifacts that we can show inside of the body you can also see some of the some of the artifacts from the from the teas that sexy the ceiling in the teeth but because I've set the functions to show me metal and they take everything else transparent here's another violent case this really didn't kill the person that person was killed by stabbed in the heart but I just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs. is not the case it's very very interesting for us to be able to look at things like knife stabbing here you can see that knife went through the heart is very easy to see how are has been leaking from one part another part which is difficult to do in a normal standard physical or topsy the really really helps the criminal investigation to establish the cause of death in the right direction to find out who the Killer really want some interesting here where you can see a bullet that has large just next to the spine and on this person and what we've done is that we've turned the bullet into LifeSource so that the bullet is a shining and it makes it really easy to find those fragments during a physical result of see if you have to dig through the body to find these fragments that's actually quite hard to do. one of the things that I'm really really happy to be able to show you here today is our go-to an autopsy table it's a touch device that we have developed based on these algorithms using standard Graphics to fuse it actually looks like this and I just give you a feeling for what it looks like it's really really it's works like a used iPhone so we've implemented all the gestures that you can do on the table and you can think of it as an as an enormous touch the interface so if you were thinking of buying an iPad forget about it this is what you want instead Steve I hope you think of this song. it's very nice to have device so if you have the opportunity please set find out it's it's really a hands-on experience. so it's getting some traction and we're trying to roll this out and trying to use it for educational purposes but also perhaps in the future in animal where are clinical and situation that's a YouTube video that you can download and look at this if you want to convey the information to other people about social justice. okay glad we talked about touch let me move on to the really touching data and this is a bit of Science Fiction now so so we're moving into that the really the future this is not really what the medical doctors are using right now but I hope that wasn't the future so what you saying I owe on the left is a touch device it said it's a little mechanical pen that has very very false Death Note is inside of the tent so I can generate a force feedback so when I do actually touched data it would generate forces in the pain so I get a feedback okay and so in this particular situation it's a it's a scan or living person I have this pain and I look at the Inn at the movie The Pain towards the head and all of a sudden I feel resistance I can feel the skin. if I push a little bit harder I'll go through the skin Mac and filled in the bone structure inside if I push even harder I'll go through the bone structure especially close to the ear with a bone is very soft and then I can feel it right inside and Isabella. this is way too nice out to take that even further this is his heart and this is also used to this fantastic new scanner that just stay in Cedar Point three seconds I can scan the whole heart and I can do that with time resolution so just looking at this heart I can play back a video here and this is called you on one of my graduate students with me working on this project and he's sitting there in front of the device the force feedback system and is moving his pain at two words to heart and the heart is not beating in front of him so you can see how the heart is beating is taking the pain and is moving at two words to heart and is putting it on the heart to let me see if the heartbeats from the real living patience and you can examine how the heart is moving it can go inside to inside of the heart and really see how the valves a movie and it's I think it's really the future for us for heart surgeon 7 is probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon to be able to go inside or the patient's heart before you have to do surgery and do that with high-quality resolution data so this is really neat. we going and even 32 science fiction and we heard a little bit about functional MRI now this is really an interesting project MRI is using magnetic fields and radio frequencies to scan of the brain or any part of the body as well be really getting out of this is information of the structure of the brain. We can also measure the difference in magnetic properties of blood does oxygenated and blood is depleted of oxygen that means that it's possible to map out the activity of the brain. so this is something that we've been working on and you just saw him outside the research engineer that going into the MRI system and he was right angles they could actually see things in the Google so I can pretend things to him why is in the scanner and this is a little bit freaky because what months are seeing is actually this you seeing his own brain. so much as doing something here and probably is going like this with his right hand because the left side is is activated wasn't on the motor cortex and then you can see that at the same time and this is something that we've been researching for a little while this is another sequence so I'm not says rain and here we ask not to go to calculate actress from 100 so he's going 194 and then you can see how did Lou Mac processor is working up here in his brain and is lighting up the whole brain is this fantastic we can do this in real time we can investigate things we can tell him to do things you can also see that is visual cortex is activate in the back of the head because that's what he's seeing you seeing his own brain and it's also hearing our instructions when we tell him to do things the signal is really deep inside of the brain as well as Chinese food because all of the day sightseeing tired of this morning I need just a second here you will see okay here not so Kate and I move your left foot soak a so it's going like this for 20 seconds is going to stop up here. motor cortex activation up there so this is really really nice and I think this is a great tool I'm connecting also to the previous talk here this is something that we could use as a tool to to really understand how the nearest are working how the brain is working and we can do this is very very high visual quality and very fast resolution. now everyone's having a bit of fun at the center so this is a cat-scan hold us an order fee so she came to the center and they sedated her and then put a string to the scanner and of course I got the whole data sets from The Lion and I can do very nice images like this I can peel off the lay it on the line and I can look inside of it and you know we've been experimenting with this and I think this is a great application for the future of this technology because there is very little known about the animal Anatomy what's no not that for veterinary I'm just kind of basic information and we can scan all sorts of things. the only problem is to set it into the machine. how do you say as a bear it was kind of hard to get it in with the Bears are cuddly friendly animal and here it is and you know you might want to cuddle this one until you change the functions that look at this day where are the bear so I'd like to thank all the people that have helped me to generate these images it's a huge effort that goes into doing this Gathering the data and developing the algorithms writing all the software so it's a talented people my mother is always I only hire people that are smarter than I am supposed to be so smart as I am so thank you very much.Sure Stop video on the Human net worth Cisco welcome to the human Network",0.7643229365348816,
22,AndrewMwenda_2007G.sph.wav,i want to say that there are two things we need to connect how the media covers africa in the west and the consequences of that by displaying despair helplessness and hopelessness the media is telling the truth about africa and nothing but the truth the media is not telling us the whole truth because despair civil and famine although they're part and parcel of our african reality they are not the only reality and secondly they are the smallest reality thank you very much but let me tell you and when they see him physically it is at public functions like this and even there it is him who advises them we have,1,"I am very very happy to be a Mideast some of the most likes a really disturbing my eyes and I am very happy and honored to be a very very Innovative and intelligent people I have listened to the three previous speakers and guess what happened and it looks and sounds like a bell. but they say in my culture that if a but it leaves a tree without saying something that bad is a young one so I will just say I'm not young and I'm very old. I still don't want something this conference at the very opportune moment because another conference is taking place in Berlin it is the G8 Summit The Summit. proposes. that the solution to Africa's problems should be a massive increase in a something that came to the Marshall Plan unfortunately I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan one because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated. it's the largest recipients were Germany and France and was only 2.5% of the GDP and receives foreign aid to the tune of 15% of its GDP and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from which countries countries. but I want to say things will it connect how the media covers Africa in the west and the consequences of that by displaying the spare helplessness and hopelessness. the media is telling the truth about Africa and nothing but the truth however the media is not telling us the whole truth because the Civil War or African reality beyond the reality was only in six countries which means as the media. Africa has immense opportunities that never never get through the web of Despair and helplessness that the Western media largely presents to each other but it appeals to pity his appeals to something called a charity and as a consequence. the Westin the view of Africa's economy is the wrong framing is a product of thinking that Africa is a place of Despair what should we do with it we should give food to the hungry we should we should send the peacekeeping troops has been stripped of definition. I want to say that it is important to recognize that Africa has fundamental weaknesses. what to do politics has opportunities and a lot of potential. we need to refresh the challenge that is facing Africa from a challenge of Despair despair which is called. we from another challenge of Hope and that is with creation the challenge facing all the slaves in Africa is not a challenge of reducing poverty it should be a challenge of creating wealth once we change those two things. did you say Africans are poor and they need action you have the international good intentions with what medicines for the for food relief for those 100 and. peacekeepers photos were facing Civil War I need the process none of these things if you are productive because you're treating. sending someone to school and to give you the medicine that is a gentleman does not create work for them is the function of income and income comes from you finding a profitable trading opportunity or a well-paying job now once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa our Second Challenge on Spotify Angela they always about 4% of the population that 16% of imitators show. but they also succeed at the job. we need put money to support private investment in Africa. I forgot today they're throwing large sums of money for food relief the entire content has been turned into a place of Despair in need of Charity charity by holding the bag. does anyone in the audience have that passion of you know a country that develops because of the generosity and. true. I can see Bruno says he knows the country which country is that.thank you very much but then the ability to utilize it into an advantage depends on the internal capacity because we lack the internal institutional framework a framework that can make it possible for us to benefit form of external relations. I'm going to go to the convention African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe to export goods data free to their opinion on the market. my own country Uganda has it twisted South and metric tons. Market. we haven't exported 1 kg yet we import of sugar from Brazil and and and Cuba I'm going to be a couple that document African countries that produce beef. have WhatsApp to spot be beautiful to the European Union Market. none of those countries including Africa's most successful Nation but one has ever been. so I want to add you today that the the fundamental source of Africa's inability to engage the rest of the world in a more productive relationship is because it has a port institutional and Percy from work and all forms of intervention need to support the evolution of the end of Institutions that create wealth solutions that increase productivity how do we begin to do that and why is able to but instrument is because or governments across the world survive. my name is Richard a simple thing like keeping Law and Order you have to pay the position. the second thing you need to do is pay you for them good paying jobs in the world with the exception of a few late-night of Idi Amin and seek to depend entirely on first as an issue in the country since they need to get legitimate governments often meet. identify things like primary education Premier Health roads in Hospitals and Clinics. if the government's fiscal survival depends on it having to raise money from its only people such a government is driven by self-interest to govern in the ocean. talk to them about the kind of forces and institutions that are necessary for them to expand their scale and scope of business so that the problem with the African continent and the problem with that is that it has to be started the structure of incentives present government in Africa. the product is imagined in a government search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy and its allies with International donors rather than sit with Ugandan. rather than sit with a gun and entrepreneurs and businessmen. so stop freaking. Enterprise League leaders our governments find it more productive to talk to the IMF and the World Bank I can tell you even if you have 10 phds you can never be Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry because the knowledge that is required for you to understand the incentives necessary to expand the business to the people that play the six actors in that industry. don't mention Africa have therefore been given an opportunity to avoid during productive Arrangements. beginning endless negotiations with the IMF and the world bank and then cuz I'm from the World Bank that tell them what is in the process with African people have been stealing from the person making a person implementation process we have good intentions in the world has taken over our rights as Citizens and governments are doing to International credit management. undiscovered is that. that is always destructive some 80's if it would roll. videos of dollars into them and then spread them across the whole world ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given Village the skills the process that allow that's more I predict sexy like inside Wood Village in Kenya where Jefferson is working and therefore generalized experience. 8 increase of the resources available to governments. I'm duck mix walking in the government the most profitable thing you can have as a person in Africa speaking in Korea. but imprisoning the political activities of the states especially in Africa now to give me struggling to enter the state in order to get access to the foreign aid pie ladies and gentlemen. the most enterprising people in Africa and work in the private sector because the institutional and first environment is hostile to business because. big dogs need to talk to their own citizens International Donuts. so the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government and that has increased the political tensions in other countries because we've been delayed. I also want to say that it is important for astronauts that over the last 50 years Africa has been receiving increasing aid from the International Community. infirm assistance and financial aid. between 1960 and 2003 our Continental received six hundred billion dollars of aid. and you're still trying to lose a lot of poverty in Africa where has it gone. I want to use the example of my own country called Uganda and the kind of structure of incentives that has broke their. in the 2006 to 77 budget expected Revenue 2.5 trillion Shillings. uganda's recurrent expenditure by recurrent what do I mean hand and mouth is 2.6 trillion why does the government of Uganda budget spend 100 and 10% of its Revenue it's because they somebody that called for an aide who contributes for it but this shows you that the government of Uganda is not committed to invest in productive Investments but rather heated watch this Revenue to. pay structure of public expenditure public about public speaking citizens text only 18 billion. send an industry text 43 billion and let me show you what does public expenditure public expenditure you got a prostitute. there you go 72 cabinet ministers 114 president's advisors by the way who never see the president except on television. when they see him physically it is a public functions like this and even there it is him who advises them. we have eight to 12 units of local government which government is organized central government bureaucracy and so many jobs for the political Zone they went to prison 22. he had. 5:35 now that 81 330 you need Weber Stadium 134 commission and semi. I said my body's all of which have directors and the cars and and the final think this is addressed to mr. Bono in his work he may help us.

23,AnilGupta_2009I.sph.wav,in fact they invite the honey,1,"I've been to you. a message from. tens of thousands of people. in The Villages in the slums in the hinterland of the country. who have solved problems to their own genius without any outside help. when I was home minister in ounces. a few weeks ago on one part of India about 200 districts that he mention what ungovernable. image of point. I find that we have been stressing for last 21 years. the flying bat in the mind in other words the mines on the Martian are not the marginal mines. that's what the message which we started 31 years ago and why did you start let me just tell you briefly my personal Journey which led me to come to this point. 8556 Ivan Bangladesh advising the government and the research Council there how to work how to help scientists work on the lines on the streets of the poor people and technology is based on the knowledge of the people. I came back in a G6. I had been tremendously integrated by the knowledge and 350 that I found the country which had such a person last night but amazing creativity. I started looking at my old work. the work that I've done for the previous 10 years average dying had instances of knowledge that people have shared. no it was paid $10 as a consultant. and I looked at my income tax return and try to ask myself is there a line in my return with shows how much of this income gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible. was it because I'm brilliant that I'm getting this report or distribution is it that I like is it that I must be entitled to this report from the society. I'd like to convince myself that are good for the policy changes you know the public policy will become more responsive to the needs and therefore I think it's okay but me. did all these years that I've been working on exploitation expectation my landlords by money lenders by Traders. give me an inside that room was also an exploiter. but there was no line in my income tax return was short this in, closed because of the Brilliance of the people in good faith and trust with me and nothing else. so what's up what kind of account but it was what I was talking about social justice and here I was a professional who was pursuing the most unjust Act of technology is getting rent from that knowledge by sharing and bringing confidence that I can pay for them publishing them in the papers getting invited to the conference is getting Consultants is and what have you. is DeMar DeRozan the mind that if I mostly flight attendants is not right. like I'm going like that. and this was a moment of great pain and drama because I couldn't couldn't leave it any longer so I did a review of Valley Construction and research that about hundred papers. 9mm is not unique the solution have to be in it. and one day I don't know what happened while coming back from the office to Works home maybe I saw a honey bee honey bee does it take nectar from the flower pollinate another flower cross pollinate. I'm going to take the nectar of the flowers don't feel short-changed. if I didn't like the honey bees. and it don't keep the bees don't keep all the money for themselves. BW3 guiding principles of network in the language they must not remain anonymous and yes I have not made one percent change in the professional practice of his heart that is a great tragedy which I'm getting stuck with me and I hope that all of you will carry this with you that the profession legitimizes publication of knowledge of people without activating Time by admitting them Anonymous the guidelines of US National Academy of Sciences research Council of UK do not require do not require from people you wash it back to them about Society society which is fair and just and you don't even notice i t i t. it's obvious that you're going to have two principles of Justice one for yourself and one for others it must be saying you cannot apply you're going to just give me that you cannot be in favor of your own distance from the values that you espouse. so Dennis the one end to the other is not divisible look at this picture. can you tell me where he's been taken from and what is it meant for anybody.

24,AnnaDeavereSmith_2005.sph.wav,sitting here alone and watching they became korean victims and other victims who in the mainstream that's why i understand that's why i have a mixed feeling about the verdict funny little play bit the atlanta airport is a modern i wish that i wish that i wish that i could be part of the enjoyment i wish that i could live together with black people the riot much difference how do you igniting fire still there out any time the other reason that i don't wear and get into the feet of somebody walking really in somebody else's shoes and i told you that in you know i didn't give you the year but in seventy nine i thought that i was going to go around and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that and i got sidetracked on race relations finally i did find a bull rider two years ago and i've been going to the rodeos with him and we've bonded and on to a destination and these trains are smooth and and he 's the lead in an op ed i did about the republican convention he 's a republican i won 't say anything about my party affiliation anyway so this is my dear dear brent williams and this is on toughness in case anybody needs to know about being tough for the work that you do i think there's a real lesson in this and this is called well i'm an optimist i mean basically i'm an optimist i mean you know i mean it's like my wife jolene her family 's always saying you know you ever think he 's just a born loser it seems like he has so much bad luck you know but then quiet and they're efficient and there's a voice on the train you know the voice was a human voice you see in the old days we and i mean funny things like this happen i was in a doctor 's office last cat scan and there was a reader 's digest october two thousand and two it was like seven ways to get lucky and she was saying you're going to make me look like an idiot because i've never been to college and i wouldn't be talking professional or anything i said well look the woman talked to me for four hours you know if i wasn't talking you know like you know she wanted me to talk i don't think she would even come out here movie eight seconds i mean like pat o 'mealey always said when i was a boy he say you know you got more try than any kid i ever seen and beauty is imitating robots and so they sewed my face up and then they had to straighten out my nose and they took these rods and shoved them up thing was once they shoved those rods up there and straightened my nose out i could breathe and i hadn't been able to this thank you when i was a little girl if you say a word often enough it becomes you and having grown up in a segregated city baltimore maryland and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors and that voice without losing a beat says because of late entry we're delayed thirty seconds just at this couple with hateful eyes and the couple 's going like this you know shrinking well i do that to steel my nerves and so i imitate a train call time has come you see well some of at the foot of calvary up you know just i see a baby a i know it's hispanic because she's speaking spanish i sort of use that idea to go around america with a tape recorder thank god for technology to interview people thinking that if i walked in their words which is also why i don't wear shoes when i perform i what is your considered opinion and the baby looks you know the way what huck did you see here 's huck he 's an illiterate kid he 's had no schooling but there's something in him and the official truth the truth was the law was that you see and huck gets on the raft and more and more less and less awareness of the pain or the other and kids i that's talk about risk taking i'm going to do somebody that nobody likes you know most actors want to do characters that are well not always but the notion especially at a conference like this i like to inspire people but since this was called risk taking i'm doing somebody who i never do because she's so unlikeable that one person actually came backstage and told me to take her out of the show she like this as a good thing but there are certain other connotations to the word risk and the same thing about the word nature what is nature maxine greene who 's a wonderful philosopher who 's and was the head of a philosophy great big philosophy kind of an organization i went to her and asked her what are the two things that she doesn't know that she still wants to know and she said well personally i still feel like i have to curtsey when i see the president of my university and i still feel as though i've got to get coffee for my male colleagues even though i've outlived most of them and she said and then intellectually i don't know enough about the negative imagination and september eleventh certainly taught us that that's a whole area we don't investigate so this piece is about a negative imagination it raises questions about what nature is what mother nature is and about what a risk can be and i got this in the maryland correctional institute for women everything i do is word for word off of a tape and i title things because i think people speak in organic poems and this is called a mirror to her mouth and this is an inmate named paulette jenkins i began to learn how to cover because i didn't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home i want everybody to think we were a normal family i mean we had all the materialistic ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes and busted lips and bruises i didn't had no more excuses and he beat me but that didn't change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family it was a nightmare and i failed them dramatically because i allowed it to go on and on and on but the night that myesha got killed and the intensity just grew and grew and grew until one night we came home from getting drugs and he got angry with myesha and he started beating her and he put her in a oh he would use a belt he had a belt because he had this warped perverted thing that myesha was having sex with her little brother and they was fondling each other that would be his reason i'm just talking about the particular night and so he put her in the bathtub and i was in the bedroom with the baby and four months before this happened four months before myesha died i thought i could really fix this man so i had a baby by him insane thinking that if i gave him his own kid he would leave mine alone and it didn't work up with three children houston myesha and dominic who was four months old when i came to and i was in the bedroom like i said he had her in the bathroom and he he every time he hit her she would fall but i dared not to move i didn't move i didn't even go and see what was i just sat there and and so she set there for about four or five hours all around her head was just swollen her head was about two sizes of sank the next morning she was on her for school and he got very excited she was dead i didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead so i there was no thing nothing coming out of her mouth he said he said he said we can 't we can't let nobody find out about this he say you've got to help me i agree i mean i've been keeping a secret for years and years and years so it just seemed like second hand to me just to keep on keeping it a secret so we went to the mall and bam it went down it went down and we told a police that we had like lost her we told a security guard that she was missing she came up wow some century to so that's an investigation of the negative imagination search for an american character with my tape recorder i thought that i was going to go around america and find it in all its aspects bull riders pig farmers drum majorettes but i sort of got tripped on race relations because my first big show was a show so this is his answer about a defining moment in american history it's a kind of an aria i would say and in many tapes that i have everybody knows that the los angeles riots happened because four cops beat up a black man named rodney king it was captured on video tape technology was played all over the world everybody thought the four cops would go to jail they did not so there were riots and what a lot of people forget is there was a second trial ordered by george bush sr and that came back with two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent i was at that trial whose stores had been burned to the ground and so this woman misters young soon han i suppose will have taught me the most that i have learned about race and she american history i in society and this is called swallowing the bitterness i used to believe think there's one you can't say many but at the end when we were in such turmoil and having all the financial problems and all the mental i began to really realize that out of this society and we are nothing why why do we have to be amount of money to survive we didn't get any because we have a and a house and we are i many african americans probably think that they won by the trial i was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict and all the they were having a party they celebrated all of south central all the churches and they say well finally well what about as i do he is the only model for black community i don't care jesse jackson model of non violence non violence and they would all like to be and i wonder if that is really justice for them to get their rights in that way,1,so my grandfather told me when I was a little girl if you say a word often enough it becomes you and having grown up in a segregated City Baltimore Maryland I should have used that idea to go around America with the tape recorder thank God for technology to interview people thinking that if I walked in their words which is also why I don't wear shoes when I perform if I walk in there words that I could sort of absorb America was also inspired by Walt Whitman who wanted to absorb American haven't absorbed him so these four characters are going to be from that work that I've known him for many years now and well over a couple thousand people I've interviewed anybody old enough to know Studs Terkel metal radio man so I thought he would be the perfect person to go to to ask about a defining moment in American history you know he was born in 1912 the year the Titanic. greatest ship. the tip of an iceberg 10 band went down then it went down and I came up well some century.so this is his answer about a defining moment in American history. that's fine and Mama American history I don't think there's one you can't say her off but that's a big I can't think of any one moment I would say it's a gradual slippage is the word used by the people in Watergate Marvel slippers it's a gradual kind of thing combination of we also have the technology that human touch your funny little pregnant and Eric are these trains that take you out to work on cars and on to a destination and these trains are smooth and efficient and imitated now we have humans imitating robot. Russian Blues and not be stressed because of late entry where they lay eggs or they said that but I happen to have a couple of drinks before Bart and I do that to steal my nerves and so I am at a time has come for some of your life and everybody laughs when I said silence ft of Calvary about to be up to no end by SIA baby a little baby and that of a mother I know it's Hispanic. Spanish. How come pregnant so I'm going to talk to the baby holding my hand over my mouth. I save a baby sir or Madam what's a shark considered a pinion starts busted out with his crazy. Thank God for a human reaction we haven't lost yet. want to see the human touch with you know you see you've got to question the official truth about Mark Twain. her experience and the official truth the truth was the law was that a black man with a property was a thing you say and have kids on the rest with a property and I'm Jim the slave see videos of your car to go and take his wife and kids and stealing from woman when the loans open Steam gun control terrible pain just then to slavers caught up guys chasing slaves looking for anybody. yeah. are they black or white. wait but why do I feel so good. president so the human touches it disappearing. You're asked about a defining defining moment of creation of moments that add up to where we are now we're trivia becomes news and more and more or less and less of the pain of the other writer from Nebraska who's into Communications and less and less in the communication. cupcake Kidz Bop I gotta scram got to go see my cardiologists and that Studs Terkel. surround sound. talk about risk-taking I'm going to do somebody that nobody likes you know most actors want to do characters that that that are likable and the one that always but a conference like this I like to inspire people but since it was called risk-taking I'm doing somebody who I never do because she's so unlikable that one person actually came backstage and told me to take her out of the show she was in. and I'm doing her because I think we think of risking a conference like this is a good thing but there's certain other connotations to the word risk in the same thing about the word nature what is nature Maxine Greene was wonderful philosopher whose is all the studs and was the head of a philosophy great big philosophy kind of organization I went to her and ask her what are the two things that she doesn't know that she still wants to know and she said well personally I still feel like I have to curtsy when I see the president of my University and I still feel as though I've got to get coffee for my male colleagues even though I've outlived most of them and she said and then intellectually I don't know enough about the negative imagination and September 11th certainly taught us if that's a whole area we don't investigate so this piece is about a negative imagination it raises questions about what nature is what Mother Nature is an about what a risk can be and I got this in the Maryland correctional institute for women everything I do is word-for-word off of a. and I title things cuz I think people speaking organic poems and this is called a mirror to her mouth and this is an inmate named Paulette Jenkins. I began to learn how to cover it up. because I didn't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home I want everybody think we were a normal family and then we had all the materialistic things but that didn't take my children Pain any less that didn't make their fears subside. I ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes and busted lips and bruises I don't have no more excuses and he beat me to it but that didn't change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family was a nightmare. and I failed them dramatically because I allowed it to go on and on and on but the night that my you should got killed and the intensity just just grew and grew and grew until one night we came home from getting drugs. and he got angry with my Asia and he started beating her to put her in the bathtub now he would use about he had about because he had this thing that my you she was having sex with her little brother name was finding each other that would be his reason I'm just talkin about the particular night that she died. hand so he put her in the bathtub and I was in the bedroom with the baby at 4 months before this happened before months before Myesha. I thought I could really fix this man so I had a baby by him insane figured if I gave him his own kid he would leave mine alone and it didn't work. did work and I ended up with three children Houston Myesha and Dominic who was four months old when I came to jail. and I was in the bedroom like I said he had her in the bathroom and he was cute every time he hit her she would fall. and she hit her head on the top. they have it continuously repeatedly I can hear it. but I did not to move I didn't move I don't even go and see what was happening I just sat there and listened. and then he put her in the hallway. it's all just sat there. and so she sat there for about 45 hours. and I told to get up. and when she got up she said she couldn't see. her face was bruised. she had a black eye. all around her head was just swollen and he was about two sizes of his own size. I told him let it go to sleep. you got to go to sleep. the next morning she was dead. he went in to check on her for school and he got very sad he said she won't breathe. I knew immediately that she was dead I didn't even want to accept the fact that she was there so I went and I put a mirror to her mouth that was nothing nothing. coming out of her mouth. I agree I agree. I mean I've been keeping a secret for years and years and he had so it just seemed like second hand to me just to keep on keeping it a secret. so we went to the mall. and we told the police that we had like lost her. but she was missing. we told the security guard. but she was missing. that she wasn't messing. we told the security guard what we had put on her we went home and we dressed her in exactly the same thing that we had told the security guy that we would put on her. and then we got the baby and my other child and we drove out to like I-95. I was so petrified and so numb. all I can look. was in the rearview mirror. and he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway. my own child. I like what happened to. so that's an investigation of the negative imagination. most of my work when I started this project code on the road a search for American character with my tape recorder I thought that I was going to go around America and find it in all its aspects bull riders Cowboys Pig Farmers drum majorettes but I should have got tripped on race relations because my first big show was a show about a race riot and so I I went to both to race riots one of us to Los Angeles riot in this next piece is from that because this is what I would say I've learned the most about race relations from this piece it's a kind of an area I would say in the mini tapes that I have everybody knows that the Los Angeles riots happen before because of four cop speed up a black man named Rodney King was captured on videotape technology it was played all of the world everybody thought the four cops to go to jail they did not do the Ra Riot and what a lot of people get if there was a second trial order by George Bush Senior and. that's all came back with two two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent I was at that trial and I mean that people just dance to the streets because I'm afraid there's going to be another explosion of joy that this verdict come back this way so there was a community that didn't the Korean Americans have been burned to the ground and so this woman is his young son Han I suppose we will have taught me the most that I have learned about race and she asks also a question of the studs talks about this notion of the official choose to question the official truth so what she's questioning here she's taking a chance and question and what Justice is into side in this is called swallowing the bitterness. I used to believe. America was the best I I watched in Korea many drugs or EST Hollywood Road I saw movie I never saw any man any back until 1992 I used to believe America was a best I still do I don't deny that because I am a victim. but at the end of 92 when we were in such turmoil I having all the financial problems and all that mental problems I began to realize that Koreans a completed a left out of this is nothing why why do we have some type of medical treatment no food stamps no g r a f f a b c African Americans who never got minimum amount of money to survive we didn't get any because it we have a car. the house. Maria high taxes pay off. where do I find it justice okay. okay okay okay my name is Eric and America's property sink and they won by the Triumph I was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict and all the time we were having a party they said African order South Central and he said that he just as has been done in this is so ciety. well what about victims rights they got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants. they have a lot of respect. as I do but Doctor Martin King. he is the only mother for black community I don't care just Jackson. hey this is the mother of non-violence non-violence and they would like to be in his ass.. But what about 1992. biggest ride in outside people. and I wonder if that is really Justice for them to get there right. I was swallowing the bitterness. sitting here all alone and watching them then became so head on wheels. but there I was happy for them I was glad for them if they think of something back okay. let's just forget about Korean victims and other victims who were destroyed by them. they fought for their. right. over two centuries and maybe because it's a sacrifice other minorities Hispanic Asian we would suffer more in the mainstream that's why I understand that's why I have a mixed defeating about the verdict but I wish that I wish that did I wish that I could be part of that joint meant I wish that I could leave together with black people. but. the riot is sick it's too much difference. the fire is still there. how do you say it.. is still there it can bust out any time. mrs. young soon Han. the other reason that I don't wear shoes is just in case I really feel like I have to cuddle up and get into the seat of somebody walking really in somebody else's shoes and I told you that and you know I didn't give you the year but in 79 I thought that I was going to go around and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that and I got sidetracked on race relations I did find a bull rider 2 years ago and I've been going to the rodeos with him and we bonded and he said the lead in it in an op-ed I did about the Republican convention he's a republican I won't say anything about my party affiliation anyway so this is my dear dear Brent Williams and this is on toughness in case anybody needs to know about being tough for the work that you do I think there's a real lesson in this in this occult toughness. call Robin optimism mean basically hunting awesomest me you know I mean it's like my wife Jolie and her family is always saying you know you never think he's just a born loser seems like he has so much bad luck in all but then when that bull stepped on my kidney you know I didn't lose my kidney I could have lost my Kitty a cat with kidney so I don't think I'm a born loser I think that's good luck then I mean when I was in that I was in the doctor's office last cat-scan and there was a Reader's Digest October 2002 sock seven ways to get lucky and it says if you want to get lucky you know you got to be around positive people I mean like even when I told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me she's like she's talking she's just being nice to you she's not going to do that and then you called me up you said you want to come out here and interview me and you went and looked it up on the internet she said look who she is and you're not even going to be able to answer her questions. and she was saying you're going to make me look like an idiot cuz I've never been to college and I wouldn't be talking professional anything I said would love a woman talk to me for hours you know if I wasn't talking a lot you know if you wanted me to talk I don't think she would even come out here. confidence well I think I ride more out of out of determination and confidence mean confidence is like you know you've been on that bull before you know you can ride in my me confidence kind of cocky but in a good way but the termination you know that's why I just you know fuck the form get the horn. Bastrop Hedeman movie 8 Seconds me like paddle melee always said when I was a boy so you know you got more tried any kid ever seen and tried to termination the same thing terminations like you're going to hang on that bull even if you're riding upside down terminations like you going to ride till your head hits back with dirt. Freedom last me to Rodeo. Beauty. I don't think I'm no beauty is. well yeah I guess I have to be to Rodeo to I mean look how we are roughly family pal around shaking hands resting around me it's like you know racking up off my credit cards and entry fees and gas we ride together we eat together when we sleep again I mean I mean I can't imagine what's going to be like the last day I R O D I mean I'll be all right I mean I have my Ranch and everything but I shouldn't even want to think about that they that calms me and I guess it just feel like just blocks day my brother died. toughness. well I'm back home where is it in West Jordan Utah on this bullshit my face right in the middle shoots enough you know busted my face all I had to go to the hospital and they had to sew me up straight Munoz out and I had to go and ride and Rodeo that night so I'm the one who put me under anesthesia or whatever you call it and so they sell Buffet supper and then head straighten out my nose and they took these rods and shoved right up through my brains and felt like it was coming out the top my head and everybody said that it should have killed me but it didn't cuz I guess I have a high tolerance for pain. but the good thing was once they shove those rise up there and straighten my nose out I could breathe and I have been able to breathe since I broke my nose and a High School Rodeo thank you. my whale.

25,AnthonyAtala_2009P.sph.wav,i'm going to show you now a very short clip it's a five second clip of a patient who received one of the engineered organs we started implanting some of these structures over fourteen years ago so we have patients now walking around with organs engineered organs for over ten years as well i'm going to show a clip of one young lady she had a spina bifida defect actually took care and now i can just go that could be treated with tissue regeneration or replacement so what can we do about it we've talked about stem cells tonight i want see at the end of the day the promise of regenerative medicine is a single promise and that is really very simple to make our patients better thank you for your attention that's a way to do it but still ways to go to get stem cells into patients in terms of actual therapies for be great if our bodies could regenerate wouldn't it be great if we could actually harness the power of our bodies to actually heal ourselves it's not really that foreign of a concept actually it happens on the earth every day this is actually a picture of a salamander salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate you see here a little video this is actually a limb injury in this salamander and this is actually real photography timed photography showing how that limb regenerates in a period of days you see the scar form this is actually a painting that hangs at the countway library at harvard medical school and it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted in the front you see actually joe and that scar actually grows out a new limb so salamanders can do it why can't we why can't humans regenerate actually we can regenerate your body many organs and every single organ in your body has a cell population that's ready to take over at the time of injury it happens every day as you age you get older your bones regenerate every ten years your skin regenerates every two weeks so your body is constantly regenerating the challenge occurs when there is an injury at the time of injury or disease the body 's first reaction is to seal itself off from the rest of the body it basically wants to fight off infection and seal itself whether it's organs inside your body or your skin the first reaction is for scar tissue to move in to seal itself off from the outside so how can we harness that power one of the ways that we do that is actually by using smart biomaterials how does this work well on the left side here you see a urethra which was injured this is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body and you see that it is injured we basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials that you can actually use as a bridge if you build that bridge and you close off from the outside environment then you can create that bridge and cells that regenerate in your body can then cross that bridge and take that path that's exactly what you see here it's actually a smart biomaterial that we used to actually treat this patient this was an injured urethra on the left side we used that biomaterial in the middle and then six months later on the right hand side you see this reengineered urethra the patient ready for the transplant while in the back room you see hartwell harrison the chief of urology at harvard actually harvesting the kidney turns out your body can regenerate but only for small distances the maximum efficient distance for regeneration is only about one centimeter so we can use these smart biomaterials but only for about one centimeter to bridge those gaps so we do regenerate but for limited distances what do we do now if you have injury for larger organs what do we do when we have injuries for structures which are much larger than one centimeter then we can start to use cells the strategy here is if a patient comes in to us with a diseased or injured organ you can very small piece of tissue from that organ less than half the size of a postage stamp you can then tease that tissue apart and look at its basic components the patient 's own cells you take those cells out grow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities but actually these materials are fairly complex and they are designed to degrade once inside the body it disintegrates a few months later acting only as a cell delivery vehicle it's bringing the cells into the body it's allowing the cells to regenerate new tissue and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away and that's what we did for this piece of muscle this is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through the structures to actually engineer the muscle we take the cells we expand them we place the cells on the scaffold and we then place the scaffold back into the patient but actually before placing the scaffold into the patient we actually exercise it we want to make sure that we condition this muscle so that it knows what to do once we put it into the patient that's what you're seeing here you're seeing this muscle bio reactor actually exercising the muscle back and forth okay these are flat structures that we see here the muscle what about other structures this is actually an engineered blood vessel very similar to what we just did but a little bit more complex here we take a scaffold and we basically scaffold can be like a piece of paper here a blood vessel is made up of two different cell types we take muscle cells we paste or coat the outside with these muscle cells very much like baking a layer cake if you will you place the muscle cells on the outside you place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside you now have your fully seeded scaffold you're going to place this in an oven like device it has the same conditions as a human body thirty seven degrees centigrade ninety five percent oxygen you then exercise it as what you saw on that tape and on the right you actually see a carotid artery that was engineered this is actually the artery that goes from your neck they were still dealing with a lot of the same challenges as many decades ago certainly many advances many lives saved to your brain and this is an x ray showing you the patent functional blood vessel they are not nearly as complex as hollow organs hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity because you're asking these organs to act on so the bladder is one such organ same strategy we take a very small piece of the bladder less than half the size of a postage stamp we then tease the tissue apart into its two individual cell components muscle and these bladder specialized cells we grow the cells outside the body in large quantities it takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder we coat the inside with these bladder lining cells we coat the outside with these muscle cells we place it back into this oven like device from the time you take that piece of tissue six to eight weeks later you can put the organ right back into the patient this actually shows the scaffold the material is actually being coated with the cells when we did the first clinical trial for these patients we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient we brought patients in but we have a major shortage of organs in the last decade the number of patients waiting for a transplant has doubled while at the same time the actual number of transplants has remained almost entirely flat six to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery did x rays and we then composed a scaffold specifically for that patient 's size pelvic cavity for the second phase of the trials we just had different sizes small medium large and extra large i'm sure everyone here wanted an extra large right so bladders are definitely a little bit more complex than the other structures but there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it this is actually a heart valve which we and the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy we take the scaffold we seed it with cells and you can now see here the valve leaflets opening and closing we exercise these prior to implantation same strategy and then the most complex are the solid organs for solid organs they're more complex because you're using a lot more cells per centimeter this is actually a simple solid organ like the ear it's now being seeded with cartilage that's the oven like device once it's coated it gets placed there and then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold this is actually digits that we're engineering these are being layered one layer at a time first the bone we fill in the gaps with cartilage we then start adding the muscle on top and you start layering these solid structures again more complex organs but by far the most complex solid organs are actually the vascularized highly vascularized a lot of blood vessel supply organs such as the heart the liver the kidneys this is actually an example several strategies to engineer solid organs this is actually one of the strategies we use a printer and instead of using ink we use you just saw and inkjet cartridge we just use cells this is actually your typical desktop printer it's actually printing this two chamber heart one layer at a time you see the heart coming out there it takes about forty minutes to print and about four to six hours later you see the muscle cells contract this technology was developed by tao ju who worked at our institute and this is actually still of course experimental not for use in patients that really has to do with our aging population we're just getting older medicine is doing a better job of keeping us alive another strategy that we have followed is actually to use decellularized organs we actually take donor organs we actually take the donor liver we use very mild detergents and we by using these mild detergents we take all the cells out of the liver two weeks later we basically can lift this organ up it feels like a liver we can hold it like a liver it looks like a liver but it has no cells all we are left with is the skeleton if you will of the liver all made up of collagen a material that's in our bodies that will not reject we can use it from one patient to the next we then take this vascular structure and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply you can see actually that's a floroscopy we're actually injecting contrast into the organ now you can see it start we're injecting the contrast into the organ into this decellularized liver and you can see the vascular tree that remains intact we then take the cells the vascular cells blood vessel cells we perfuse the vascular tree with the patient 's own cells we perfuse the outside of the liver with the patient 's own liver cells and we can then create functional livers and that's actually what you're seeing this is still experimental but we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure experimentally but as we age our organs tend to fail more so that's a challenge not just for organs but also for tissues for the kidney as i talked to you about the first painting that you saw the first slide i showed you ninety percent of the patients on the transplant wait list are waiting for a kidney ninety percent so another strategy we're following is actually to create wafers that we stack together like an accordion if you so we stack these wafers together using the kidney cells and then you can see these miniature kidneys that we've they are actually making urine again small structures our challenge is how to make them larger and that is something we're working on right now at the institute the things that i wanted to summarize for you then is what is a strategy that we're going for in regenerative medicine if at all possible we really would like to use smart biomaterials that we can just take off the shelf and regenerate your organs we are limited with distances right now but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time if we cannot use smart biomaterials then we'd rather use your very own cells why because they will not reject we can take cells from you if you present with a diseased wind pipe we'd like to take cells from your windpipe if you present with a diseased pancreas we'd like to take cells from that organ why because we'd rather take those cells which already know that those are the cell types you want a windpipe cell already knows it's a windpipe cell we don't need to teach it to become another cell type so we prefer organ specific cells and today we can obtain cells from most every organ in your body except for several which we still need stem cells for like heart liver nerve and pancreas and for those we still need stem cells if we can not use stem cells from your body then we'd like to use donor stem cells and we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors and we're working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago stem cells from the amniotic fluid and the placenta which have those properties so at this point i do want to tell you that some of the major challenges we have you know i just showed you this presentation everything looks so good everything works these technologies really are not that easy some of the work you saw today was performed by over seven hundred researchers at our institute so i always like to show this cartoon this is how to stop a runaway stage and there you see the stagecoach driver and he goes on the top panel he goes a b c d e f he finally stops the runaway stage and those are usually the basic scientists the bottom is usually the surgeons a very stunning statistic every thirty seconds a patient dies from i'm a surgeon so that's not that funny but actually method a is the correct approach and what i mean by that is that anytime we've launched one of these technologies to the clinic we've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can in the laboratory before we ever launch these technologies to patients and when we launch these technologies to patients we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question are you ready to place this in your own loved one your own child your own family member and then we proceed because our main goal of course is first to do no harm,1,this is actually a a painting that hangs at the countway library at the Harvard Medical School and it shows the first time in order in which they were transplanted I end up front you see actually Joe Mary getting the patient ready for the transplant while in the back room you see Hardwell Harrison the chief of Urology at Harvard actually harvesting the kidney the kidney was indeed the first or Endeavour to be transplanted to the human that was back in 1950 for 55 years ago it we're still dealing with a lot of the same challenges as many decades ago certainly many advances many life saved but we have a major shortage of organs in the last decade the number of patients waiting for a transplant has doubled well at the same time the actual number of transplants has remained almost entirely flat that really has to do with our aging population we're just getting older medicine is doing a better job. of keeping us alive but if we age our organs 10 to Fillmore so that's a challenge not just for organs but also for tissues trying to replace pancreas trying to replace nerve second help us with Parkinson's be served major issues this is actually a very stunning statistic every 30 seconds a patient dies from the csis that could be treated with tissue regeneration a replacement. so what can we do about it we talked about stem cells tonight. that's a way to do it but still waste to go to get stem cells into patients in terms of actual therapies for organs of our bodies to regenerate wouldn't be great if we could actually harness the power of our bodies to actually heal ourselves it's not really that boring of a concept actually it happens on the Earth every day this is actually a picture of a salamander salamanders have his amazing capacity to regenerate you see here a little video This is actually a limb injury in the salamander and this is actually real photography time photography showing how that limb regenerates in the period of days you see the scar form and then that's car actually gross out a new limb. do salamanders can't do it why can't we why can't humans regenerate actually we can regenerate your body. has many organs and every single organ your body has a cell population that's ready to take over at the time of injury happens every day as you age as you get older your bones regenerate every 10 years your skin regenerate every two weeks to your body is constantly regenerating the challenge occurs when there's an injury at the time of injury or disease the body's first reaction is to seal itself off from the rest of the body it does it basically wants to fight off infection and seal itself with its organs inside your body or your skin the first reaction is for scar tissue to move in to steal itself from the seal itself off from the outside so how can we harness that power one of the way so we do that it's actually by using smart bomb materials. how does this work well on the left side here you see a urethra which was injured this is a channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body and you see that it's injured that we basically found out there you can use the smartphone materials that you can actually use us a bridge if you build that bridge and you closed off from the outside environment then you can create that bridge and cells that regenerate your body can then cross that bridge and take that path that's exactly what you see here text Leah smart bomb material that we used to actually treat this patient this was an injured urethra on the left side will use that by material in the middle and then six months later on the right hand side you see this re-engineered urethra turn sound your body can regenerate but only for a small distances the maximum diffusion distance for regeneration tell me about 1 cm. so we can use the smart bomb materials but only for about one centimeter to bridge those gaps. so we do regenerate but for a limited distances what do we do now if you have injury for larger organs what do we do when we have injuries for structures which are much larger than one centimeter then we can start to use sells the strategy here is his of a patient comes into us with a deceased or injured Oregon you can take a very small piece of tissue from that organ less than half the size of a postage stamp you can send t-stat tissue apart and look at its basic components of patients on sales you take themselves out grow and expand its sales outside the body in large quantities and then we then you scaffolds materials to the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse or your shirt. but actually these materials are fairly complex and they're designed to be great once inside the body it disintegrates a few months later it's acting only as a seal delivery vehicle bringing the sails into the body to allowing the cells to regenerate new tissue and once it has regenerated the scaffold goes away and that's what we did for this piece of muscle this is actually showing a piece of my soul on how we go through the structures to actually engineer the muscle we take the self we spend them with Place itself in the scaffold and we didn't place a scaffold back into the patient but actually before placing the scaffold to the patient we actually exercise it we want to make sure that we condition this muscle so it knows what to do once we put into the patient that's what you're seeing here you sing this muscle bioreactor actually exercise in the muscle back and forth. okay these are flat structures that we see here the muscle. what about other structures this is actually a engineer blood vessel very similar to what we just did but a little bit more complex here we take a scaffold and we basically scaffold to be like a piece of paper here we can into Miller Isis scaffold and what we do is leave to make a blood vessel sinks strategy we take the blood vessels made up of two different cell types we take muscle cells with with paste or code the outside with these muscle cells very much like baking a layer cake if you will you play some muscle cells on the outside you place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside you now have your fully seated scaffold you going to places in an oven like the vice it has the same conditions as a human body 37 degrees Centigrade 95% oxygen use an exercise it as what you saw on that tape and on the ride you actually see a carotid artery that was engineer this is actually the artery that. your neck to your brain and this is an x-ray showing you the Paden functional blood vessel more complex structures such as blood vessels urethra switch I showed you are definitely more complex cuz you're using two different cell types but they're really acting mostly as conduits you're allowing fluid or are to go through and steady-state they're not nearly as complex as hollow organs hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity cuz you're asking these organs to act on demand so the bladder is one such Oregon same strategy would take a very small piece of the bladder listen half the size of a postage stamp with a piece of tissue apart into two individual cell components muscle and the splatter specialized cells we grow this else outside the body in large quantities it takes about 4 weeks to grow these cells from the Oregon will take a scaffold and we shaped like a bladder we coat the inside with his bladder lining cells we caught the outside with a C. do cells replace it back into the oven light device and the time you take that piece of tissue six to eight weeks later you can put your gun right back into the patient. this actually shows the scaffold the material is actually being coated with the cell when we did the first clinical trial for these patients we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient we brought the patients in six to eight weeks prior to the schedule surgery did X-rays and we've been composed to scaffold specifically for that patient size pelvic cavity for the second phase of the trial if we just have different sizes small medium large and extra-large. it's true. I'm sure everyone here when it an extra large fry. so bladders are definitely a little bit more complex than the other structures added complexity to a heart valve which we engineered this heart valve the same strategy we take the scaffold we seed it with sales and can now see here the valve leaflets opening and closing we exorcise these prior to implantation same strategy. and in the most complex are the solid organs for solid organs there more complex refusing a lot more self or centimeter this is actually simple cell that organ like the ear is now being seen with Carlos that's the mold that the oven like device once it's coded it gets placed there and then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold this is actually digits that were engineering to start being Laird one layer at a time first of all along we fill in the gaps with Carl which we then start adding the muscle on top and you start lowering the solid structures again for leave more complex organs but by far the most complex solid organs are actually the vascularized highly vascularized a lot of blood vessel Supply organ such as the heart deliver the kidneys. this is actually an example of several strategies mention your solid organ sits just actually one of the strategies will you said printer and instead of using Inc we use you just on the Inkjet cartridge we just you said this exactly your typical desktop printer and sexually printing this to chamber of heart one layer at a time you see the heart coming out there takes about 40 minutes to print in about 4 to 6 hours later you see the muscle cells contract. this this technology was developed by tells you who worked at our Institute in this is actually still of course experimental not for use in patients. another strategy that we have followed us actually to use the seller I store in to actually take donor organs and we then organs are discarded and we then can use very mouthy turgeon to take all the cell elements out of these organs so for example and the left panel top panel you see a liver we actually take the donor liver was very mild detergent and wheat by using a small detergents will take all the cells out of the liver two weeks later we basically can lift this organ up it feels like a liver we can hold it like a liver it looks like a liver but has no self all we are left with is the skeleton if you will of the liver all made up of collagen eye material it's in our body they will not reject we can use it from one patient to the next week and take this vascular structure and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supplies you can see actually it's a fluoroscopy or actually injecting contrast into the Oregon. now you can see it start we're injecting the contracts sent to the Oregon into this the Sailor ice liver and you can see the vascular tree that remains in time we didn't take the sales the vascular cells cells with profuse the vascular tree with a patient's own cells with profuse the outside of the liver with a patient's own liver cells and we can then create functional livers and that's actually what you're seeing this is still experimental that we are able to reproduce the functionality of the liver structure experimental e for the kidney kidney has a talk to you about the first thing that you saw the first like I showed you 90% of the patients on the transplant waiting lists are waiting for a kidney 90% sold another strategy were following us actually to craneway First that we stacked together like an according if you will so we stacked these waivers together using the kidney cells and then you can see the kidney that these miniature kidneys that we've engineered they're actually making urine. again small structures are challenges how to make them larger and that's something we're working on right now at the Institute. one of the things that I wanted to summarize for you then it's what is a strategy that we're going for in return of medicine if it all possible we really would like to use Smart bomb materials can we can just take off the shelf and regenerate your organs we are limited with distances right now but argolis actually to increase those distances over time if we cannot use Smart bomb material would rather use your very own selves why because they will not reject to take cells from you create the structure for the right back into they will not reject and if possible we rather used to sell from your very specific Oregon if you precent with a deceased windpipe we'd like to take shells from your windpipe if we sent with a deceased a pancreas we would like to take cells from that Oregon because we'd rather take those sales which already know that there's for the cell types you want them windpipe sell already knows it's a windpipe so we don't need to Tisa to become another cell type so we prefer organs. if it's else in today we can obtain self most every organ in your body except for several which we still need stencils for like hot like hard liver nerve and pancreas and for those we still need a stem cells. if we cannot use a stem cells from your body than we'd like to use donor stem cells and cells we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form to immerse and we're working a lot with the stem cells that published on two years ago still stem cells from the amniotic fluid and the placenta which have those properties. so at this point you know I do want to tell you that some of the major challenges we have you know I just showed you this presentation everything looks so good everything works as you know these Technologies really are not that easy off today was performed by our 700 researchers at our Institute across that 20-year time span sweets are very tough technology once you get the formula ride you can replicate it but it takes a lot to get there so I always like to show this cartoon this is how to stop run away stage and there you see that Stagecoach driver and he goes on the panel Eagles ABCDEFG finally stops running away stage and do so usually the basic scientist the bottom of so usually the surgeons. I'm a surgeon so that's not that funny but actually method is a correct approach and what I mean by that is that any time with launch one of these technologist the clinic will make absolutely sure that we do everything we can in the laboratory before we ever launched these Technologies to patients to patients we want to make sure that we ask for some very tough question are you ready to place us in your own loved one your own child your own family member and then we'll proceed because it was our main goal of course his first to do no harm I'm going to show you now a very short clip it's a five-second clip of a patient who received one of the engineered organs we started in planting some of these structures over 14 years ago and we have patients not walking around with organs engineered organs for 10 years as well I'm going to show you a clip of one young lady she had a spina bifida defect a spinal cord of normality she did not have a norm. bladder the second from seeing then we are just taking five seconds is a segment of Sanjay Gupta actually took care of some kind of like an accident or something and now I can just go and go out with my friends go do whatever I want. see at the end of the day the promise of regenerative medicine is a single promise and that is really very simple to make our patients better thank you for your attention,0.76171875,
26,AnupamMishra_2009I.sph.wav,and one stores so it depends on the terrain but kund which uses the gypsum belt for that you have to go back to your calendar three million years it can be done right now and you can notice they have created a kind of false the desert is there sand dunes some small field and this is all you can notice the small holes the water will fall on this catchment and there is a slope sometimes and architects do not care about slopes in bathrooms but here they will care properly and the water will go where it should go and then it is forty feet deep the waterproofing is done perfectly better than our city contractors because not a single drop should go waste in this they collect one hundred thousand liters in one season and this is pure drinking water below the surface there is hard saline water but now you can have we should not move quickly to the desert so we often use a term called bylaws because we are used to get things but here it is unwritten by law and people make their house and the water storage tanks these raised up platforms just like this fifteen feet deep and collect rain water from roof there is a small pipe and from their courtyard it can also harvest something like twenty five thousand in a good monsoon another big one this is of course out of the hardcore desert area this is near jaipur this is called the jaigarh fort and it can six million gallons of rainwater in one season the age is four hundred years so since four hundred years it has been giving you almost six million gallons of water per season you can the price of that water it draws water from fifteen kilometers of canals you can see a modern road hardly fifty years it can break sometimes but this four hundred year old canal which draws water is is maintained for so many generations of course if you want to go inside the two doors are locked but they can be opened for ted people and them you can see person coming up with two canisters of water and the water these are not empty canisters water level is right up to this it can the color the taste the purity of this water and this is what they call zero b type of water because it comes from the clouds pure distilled water stop for a quick commercial break and then we come back to the traditional systems the government this is a very backward area and we should bring a multi million dollar project to bring water from the himalayas that's why i said that this is a commercial but we will come back once again to the water from three hundred four hundred kilometers away soon it become like this in many portions water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything of course there are some areas where water is reaching i'm not saying that it is not reaching at all but the tail end the you will notice in bikaner things like this where the water hyacinth couldn't grow the sand is flowing in these canals the bonus is that you can find wildlife around it we had full page advertisements some thirty years twenty five years ago when this canal came they said that your traditional systems these new cement tanks will supply you piped water it's a dream and it became a dream also because so welcome to the golden desert indian desert it receives the least rainfall in the country lowest soon the water was not able to reach these areas and people started renovating their own structures these are all traditional water structures which we won 't be able to explain in such a short time but you can see that no woman is standing on those and this is heart of desert this town was established eight hundred years ago i'm not sure by was there or delhi was there or chennai was there or bangalore was there so this was the terminal point for silk route well connected eight hundred years ago through able to go to europe but jaisalmer was well connected to it and this is the sixteen centimeter such a limited rainfall and highest colorful life flourished in these areas you won 't find in this slide but it is invisible somewhere a stream or a rivulet is through here or if you want to paint you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture drops and deposit in the rooms apart from this system they designed fifty two beautiful water bodies around this town and what we call private public partnership you can add estate also so public and private enterprise work together to build this beautiful water body and it's a kind of water body for all seasons you will admire it just behold the beauty throughout the year whether water level goes up or down the beauty is there throughout another water body dried up of course during the summer period but you can see how the traditional society combines these statues marvelous statues gives you an idea of water this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank it will submerge these beautiful statues in what we call in english today mass communication this everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drown so water will be there for seven months or nine months or twelve months and then they will come and small water body called the it is difficult to hundred meters and in most parts it is saline not fit for drinking so you in severe drought periods nobody has seen this water body getting dried up and perhaps that on sixth november two thousand and nine there will be a ted green and blue session so they painted it like this water body children are standing on a very difficult device to explain this is called kund we have in english it squeeze the moisture hidden in the sand and they have dubbed this water as the third one called and is a gypsum belt running below it and it was deposited by the great mother earth some million years ago and where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water this is the same dry water body now you don't find any they are all submerged but when the water goes down they will be able to draw water from those structures throughout the year this year they have received only six centimeters six there is no electricity in most of the villages but suppose you use the green technology solar pumps they are of no use in this area so welcome to the golden desert and they can telephone you that if you find any water problem in your city delhi bombay bangalore mysore please come to our area of six centimeters we can give you water how they maintain them there are three things concept planning making the actual thing and also maintaining them for maintain for centuries by generations without any department without any funding so the secret your own thing not personal property my property every time so these remind you that you are entering into a water body area don't spit don't to anything wrong so that the clean water can be on your right side if you climb these three six steps you will find something very nice this was done in eleventh century and you have to go further down they say that a picture is worth a thousand words so we can say a thousand words the water table goes down you will find new stairs if it comes up some of them will be submerged so this beautiful system will give you some pleasure three sides such steps on the fourth side there is a four story building where you can organize such ted conferences anytime who built these in front of you the best civil engineers we had the best planners the best architects we can say that clouds seldom visit this area but we find forty different names of clouds in this dialect used there were no english medium schools at that time even no hindi schools schools but such people compelled to the east india company which came here for business a very dirty kind of business but not to create the engineering colleges but because of them first engineering college was created in a small village not in the town the last point we all know in this tire comes from the airplane so look at the beauty from the desert society who can harvest rainwater and also create something through a tire from a jet plane and used in a camel last picture it's a tattoo two thousand years old tattoo they were using it on was at one time a kind of a blacklisted or con thing but now it you can copy this tattoo i have some posters of this life is water these are the beautiful waves these are the beautiful stairs which we just saw in one of these and these are the flowers which add fragrance to our lives so this is the message of desert thank you very much a number of techniques to harvest rain this is a new work it's a new program but for the desert society this is no program this is their life and they first of all i wish i had your eloquence truly in any artifacts and designs are inspiring do you believe that they can be and in other parts also and these which stored water there are two type of things one,1,"promotions we should not move quickly to the desert. so what's a small housekeeping announcement please switch off your proper English check programs installed in your brain. so welcome to the golden Desert Indian Desert it receives the least rainfall in the country lowest rainfall if you are well-versed with inches 9 in centimeters 16 inches deep down water is 300 ft deep and in most part it is not fit for drinking so you can't install hand pumps are to Wells and do there is no electricity in most of the villages but suppose you use the Green Technology solar pumps they are of no use in this area. goats seldom visit this area but we find 40 different names of clouds in this dialect used are there are a number of techniques to harvest rain this is a new world it's a new program but for the desert Society this is no program this is their life and they. harvest rain in many ways to this is the first device they use in harvesting rain it's called Koontz and where it is called and you notice they have created a kind of false catchment the desert is there send you some small field and this is all big raise the platform. you can notice the small holes with the water will fall on this catchment and there is a slow sometimes ever engineers and Architects do not care about open bathrooms but they said they will care properly and the water will go where it should go and then it is 40 ft deep. body of water proofing is done perfectly better than ever City contractors because not a single drop should go waste in this they collect $100,000 in one season and this is pure drinking water below the surface there is saline water but now you can have this for ear around itself to houses we often use the term called bylaws because we are used to get written things but it is Unwritten by law and people make their house. and the water storage tanks these days the play from just like this state in fact they go fifteen feet deep and collect rainwater from roof this is small pie and from their Courtyard it can also Harvest something like twenty-five thousand in a good Monsoon another big one this is a coaster out of for the hardcore desert area this is near Jaipur this is called a jagger port and it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season the age is 400 years since four hundred years it has been giving you almost six million gallons of water per season you can calculate the price of that water it draws water from 15. 2 m of channels you can see it more than Road hardly fifty years old it can breathe sometimes but this for hundred-year-old cannot which draws water it is maintained for so many generations of course if you want to go inside the two doors are locked but they can be open for dead people and really Kristen you can see a person coming up with two canisters of water and the water level these are not empty canisters water level is right it can Envy many men spell tease. the color the test the purity of this water and this is what they call 0 B type of water because it comes from the clouds pure distilled water. we stopped for a quick commercial break and then we come back to the traditional systems the government thought that this is a very backward area and we should bring a multimillion-dollar project to bring water from the Himalayas that's why I said that this is a commercial break but once again be shifting from 300-400 away soon it became like this in many portions water Hyacinth covered these big kennels like anything of course there are some areas where water is reaching I'm not saying that it is not leaking at all but detail and the Jets helmet area you will notice in because things like this where the water Hyacinth couldn't grow. send this flowing in this kennels the bonuses that you can find Wildlife around it. we had full page epic moments 25 years ago when this canal came they said that throw away your traditional systems these new semen tanks will supply you buy the water it's the dream and it became a dream also because soon the water was not able to reach these areas and people started renovating their own structures these are all the different water structures which we won't be able to explain in such a short time but you can see that no woman is standing on those and. they are selecting hair so remove. jetsonmade this is heart of David this town was established eight hundred years ago I'm not sure by that time when we was there or daily was there. You never said or Bangalore was there so this was the terminal point for silk route well-connected eight hundred years ago through Europe. none of us were able to go to Europe was well connected to it and this is the area of limited rainfall and highest colorful life flourished in these areas you won't find water in this light but it is invisible somewhere I stream or river is running or if you want to paint you can paint it blue throughout because every roof with you see in this picture collect rain water drops and deposit. in the rooms. but apart from this system design 52 beautiful water bodies around this town and what we call private-public partnership you can State also has a state public and private and Chuck Norris work together to build this beautiful water body and it's a kind of water body for All Seasons you will admit it just behold the beauty throughout the year where the water level goes up and down the beauty is there throughout another water body dried-up of course during the summer. But you can see how the traditional Society combines. engineering with Aesthetics regard these statues marvelous sister juice gives you an idea of water table when this rain comes and the water starts feeling this thing it will submerge is beautifulest a choose and what we call in English Today mass communication this was for mass communication everybody know that this elephant has drawn so water will be there for 7 months at 9 months or 12 months and then they will come and worship despond respect their gratitude another small water body called the jasiri it is difficult to translate in English especially in my English the nearest will be glory did a petition in desert of this is small world water bodies that it never dries up in severe drought. Nobody has seen this water body. getting tied up and perhaps the nudie future also it was designed some of 150 years ago but what if the new date on 6th November 2009 there will be a dead green and blue session so they painted it like this. Drive Auto Body children are standing on a very difficult device to explain this is called Queen we have in English surface water and groundwater but this is not groundwater you can draw groundwater from any well but this is no ordinary well it squeeze the moisture hidden in the hidden in the sand and they have done this water is the third one called region and there is a gypsum belt running below it and it was deposited by the great mother are some three million years ago and where we have this gypsum strip they can Harvest this water this is the same dry water body now you don't find any Queen they are all submitted but they when the water goes down they will be able to draw water from those expected throughout the year this year. I have received only 6 cm and 6 cm of rainfall and they can telephone you that if you find any water problem in your car in your city they live on Bay bangalore-mysore please come to our area of 6 cm we can give you water. how they maintain them there are three things can set planning making the actual thing and also maintaining them in these districts were maintained for Centuries by Generations without any Department without any funding to the secret is Santa respect your own thing not personal property. my property every time so this is Stone pillars will remind you that you are entering into a water body area don't they spit don't do anything wrong and so deadly clean water can be connected another pillar Stone pillar on your right side if you climbed these 360 steps you'll find something very nice this was done in 11th century and you have to go further down they say that a picture is worth a thousand words so we can save a thousand words right now and another thousand if the water table goes down you will find new stairs if it comes up some of them will be submerged so throughout the year this beautiful system will give you some pleasure please sites such as steps on food side there is a 40-story building where you can organize such that conferences anytime. excuse me who built these receptors. dad in front of you the best civil engineers we had the best plan has the best Architects we can say that because of them because of their forefathers India could get the first engineering College in 1847 there were new English medium School said that I'm even know Hindi School st. Louis schools but such people compared to the East India Company which came here for business a very dirty kind of business but better not to create the engineering college but because of them first thing in college was created in a small village not in the town the last point we all know in our primary schools that Camel is a ship of desert so you can find through your Jeep a camel and a card. this tire comes from the Aeroplane who can Harvest rainwater and also create something thrown a tire from a jet plane and used in a camel card last picture it's a tattoo 2000 years old tattoo zingat on their body tattoo was at 1 time a calendar for blacklisted or daunting but now it is anything to this is you can copy this tattoo I have some posters of this the center. if life is water these are beautiful waves these are the beautiful states which we just saw in one of the slides these are the trees. and these are the flowers which give which Ed fragments to a life so this is the message of dessert thank you very much. I'm parked.. So Festival I wish I had your eloquence Julie in any language. these artifacts and designs that are inspiring they can be used elsewhere that the world can learn from this or is this just right for this place no D in the basic idea is to utilize whatever falson area so the puns the open bodies are everywhere right from Sri Lanka to cash me and another part and then deepstack us which is stored water and there are two types of things one recharge and when is stows so it depends on the terrain between which uses the Jeep symbol for that you have to go back to your calendar three million years ago if it is there it can be done right now otherwise it can be done.

27,AriannaHuffington_2010W.sph.wav,men sleep deprivation has become a i was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before and i felt like saying to him but i didn't say it i felt like saying you know what if you had gotten five this dinner would have been a lot more there is now a kind of sleep deprivation one upmanship especially here you try to make a breakfast date and you say how about eight o 'clock they're likely to tell you eight o'clock is too late for me but that's okay i can get a game of tennis in and do a few idea is a very very small idea far too many icebergs hitting our titanics in fact i have a feeling that if lehman brothers was lehman brothers and sisters they might still be while all the brothers were busy just being hyper connected twenty four seven maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg because she would have woken up from a seven and a half or eight hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture can unlock billions of big ideas so as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment what is good for us on a personal level what's going to bring more joy gratitude effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world so i to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep thank you that are at the moment dormant inside us and my little idea that will do that is sleep this is a room of sleep deprived women and two and half years ago i fainted from exhaustion i hit my head on my desk i broke my cheek bone i got five stitches on my right eye and i began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep and in the course of that i studied i met with medical doctors scientists and i'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive more inspired more joyful life is getting enough sleep and we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution this new feminist issue we are literally going to sleep our way to the top,1,my big idea is a very very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us and my little idea that will do that is sleep. pictures of of Taipei women. this is a room of sleep-deprived women. and I learned the hard way the value of sleep and a half years ago I stained it from exhaustion I hit my head on my desk I broke my cheekbone I Got 5 stitches on my right eye and I began the Journey of rediscovering the value of sleep. and in the course of that I started a med with medical doctor scientist and I'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive morning spired more joyful life is getting enough sleep.and we women are going to lead the way in this new Revolution this new family station we are literally going to sleep our way to the top. because unfortunately from men sleep deprivation has become a religious symbol. I was recently having dinner with a guy who brags that he had only got them for our sleep the night before and I feel like saying to him but I didn't say I felt like saying you know what if you had gotten by this dinner would have been a lot more interesting. there's not a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship to make a breakfast date and he said how about 8 then you're not going to get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at 8. and I think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive but the truth is they're not because we are at the moment has had a brilliant leaders in business and finance in politics making terrible decisions. so a high IQ does not mean that you are a good leader because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic. and we've had far too many icebergs kissing our Titanic in fact I have a feeling that the Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters there might still be around. find all the brothers were busy as you know just being hyper connected 24/7 maybe a sister would have noticed because she would have woken up from a seven and a half sleeve and her being able to see the big picture. so I should have facing all the multiples prices in our world at the moment what is good for us on a personal level what's going to bring more joy gratitude Effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers he's also what is best for the world. so I heard you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that line side us to shop your engines and discover the power of sleep thank you.25% of the world's Food Supplies lost spoilage 458 billion dollars worth every year. so we can know how far to travel monitor temperature all the way to the market we make it safer that's what I'm working on.,0.796875,
28,ArthurBenjamin_2005.sph.wav,i'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator there is something called the square of a number which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself for instance five squared would be and on most calculators that will give you the square on some of these ancient rpn calculators you've got an x squared button on it will allow you to do the calculation even faster what i'm going to try and do now is to square in my head four two digit numbers good morning ladies and gentlemen my name is art benjamin and i am a mathemagician what that means is i combine my loves of math and magic to do something i call faster than they can do on their calculators even using the shortcut method what i'll use is the second row this time and i'll get four of you one two three four yell out a two digit number and if you would square the first number and if you would square the second the third and the i will try and race you to the answer ok so quickly a two digit number please let me try to take this one step further i'm going to try to square some three digit numbers this time i won 't even write these down i'll just call them out as they're called out to me anyone i point to call out a three digit number another another three digit another another another three digit number sir let me try to take this one step further i'm going to try to square a four digit number this time now you can all take your time on this i will not beat you to the answer on this one but i will try to get the answer right nine ab nine seven seven five that does yours go in the meanwhile let me conclude so you should have as an answer either a six digit or probably a seven digit number how many digits do you have six or seven seven and yours i shall attempt the impossible or at least the improbable i see i see one way in the back you sir that's three and anybody on this side here ok you over there on the aisle would the four of you with calculators please bring out your calculators then join me up on stage and let 's give these volunteers a nice round of applause the odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing would be one in ten thousand ten to the fourth power ok any six of them really scramble them up you leave out the number seven and let 's give all four of these people for my next number while i mentally recharge my batteries i have one more question for the audience by any chance does anybody here happen to know anybody here who 'd like to know the day of the week they were born we can do it that way of course i could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know so i come prepared for that i didn't mean to look at you sir you were just sitting there you can help me out here if you wouldn't mind this is a book of calendars and yeah ok that book in front of you do me a favor turn to a year outside of the nineteen hundreds either into the eighteen hundreds or way into the i haven't had the chance to work with these calculators i need to make sure that they are all working properly would somebody get us started by giving us a two digit number please how about a two digit number things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation was a gentleman up here who had a ten digit calculator where is he would you stand up ten digit guy ok well stand up for me just for a second so i can see where you have a ten digit calculator sir as well ok what i'm going to try and do is to square in my head a five digit number requiring a ten digit calculator but to make my job more interesting for you as well as for me i'm going to do this problem thinking out loud so you can actually honestly hear what's going on in my mind while i do a calculation of this size now i have to apologize to our magician friend lennart green i know as a magician we're not supposed to reveal our secrets but i'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week let 's see let 's take a let 's take a different row of with you i'll get five digits one two three four oh i did this row already let 's do the row before you starting with you sir one two three four five call out a single digit that will be the five digit number that i will try to square add all those numbers together and with any luck arrive at the answer now let me recap while i explain something else i know that you can use right while i do these calculation you might words as opposed to numbers creep into the calculation let me explain what that is this is a phonetic code a mnemonic device that i use that allows me to convert numbers into words i store them as words and later on retrieve them as numbers i know it sounds complicated it's not i just don't want you to think you're seeing something out of rain man here there's definitely a method to my madness definitely definitely sorry want to talk to me about adhd afterwards by the way one last instruction for my judges with the calculators ok you know who you are there is at least a fifty percent chance that i will make a mistake here if i do don't tell me what the mistake is just say you 're close or something like that and i'll try and figure out the answer which could be pretty entertaining in itself if here that to fission to would you like to try a more standard calculator just in case ok great what i'm going to try and do then i notice that took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer that's ok,1,"good morning ladies and gentlemen my name is Art Benjamin and I am a mathematician what that means is I combine my loves of math and Magic to do something I called mathemagics before I get started I have a quick question for the Audience by any chance did anyone happen to bring with them this morning a calculator seriously if you have a calculator with you raise your hand is your hand I was your hand go up and I'll bring bring it out bring it out anybody else I see I see one way in the back you serve that that's three and anybody on this side here okay you over there on the aisle with the four of you with calculators please bring out your calculator then join me up on stage and let's give these volunteers and nice round of applause. okay, since I haven't had the chance to work with these calculators I need to make sure that they are all working properly would somebody got us started by giving us a two digit number please how about a 2 digit number. 22 and another two digit number sir multiply 22 * 47 make sure you get 1034 or the calculators are not working do all of you get 1034 1034 594 let's give three of them a nice round of applause there. would you like to try a more standard calculator just in case okay great when I'm going to try and do them I noticed that took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer that's okay I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator there something called the square of a number which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself for instance 5 squared would be 25 we can square on most calculators let me demonstrate with this one is by taking the number such as five hitting times and then equal and I most calculators that will give you the square on some of these ancient rpn calculator you got an x squared button on it allowed to do the calculation even faster when I'm going to try and do now is to square in my head for two digit numbers faster than they can do under calculators even using the shortcut method what are uses the second row the sign by 4 if you want to 34d to yell out a two-digit number and a few wood Square the first number. a few words for the 2nd the 3rd and the 4th I will try and race you to the answer okay so quickly a a two digit number please 37 squared okay. 23 squared okay. 59 squared okay and finally 93 squared would you call out your answers please. 1369 529-3481. thank you very much. let me try to take this one step further going to try to square some three digit numbers this time I won't even write these down I'll just call them out as they're called out to me any when I point to call out a three digit number anyone on her panel verify the answer just gives some indication if it's write a three-digit number 980-770-4169. another another 3 digit another 457-200-5849 to 05849. 321 is 100 3041 1030 for one just one more three digit number please. 722 is 500 with a harder one that 500 13284 yes please. 162 squared 26244. thank you very much. let me try to take this one step further. I'm going to try to square a four-digit number this time now you can all take your time on this I will not beat you to the answer on this one but I will try to get the answer right to make this a little bit more random let's take out before I throw this time I say 1 2 3 4 if each of you would pull out a single digits between 0 and 9 that will be the four digit number that I'll square 97589 75 Acres of taking me a little bit of time so bear with me 95 million. 218564 thank you very much. now I would attempt to square a five-digit number and I can but unfortunately most calculators cannot. ain't that the capacity don't you hate that so so since we reached the limits of our calculator. does your does your go there just go higher. oh really you been 10 years. I'll talk to you later in the meanwhile let me take the largest number on the board your 8649 will you each answer that on your calculator and instead of squaring at this time I want you to take that number and multiply it by any three digit number that you want but don't tell me what you're multiplying by just X any random three digit number so you should have a 6-digit or probably a seven digit number how many digits do you have six or seven seven seven seven. and uncertain seven is there any possible way that I could know what 7 digit numbers you have say no. then I shall attempt The Impossible or at least the improbable but I'd like each of you to do for me to order you'd like. one digit at a time I shall try and determine the digit you left out starting with your seven digit number so I can call any six of them please. did you leave out the number six but okay that's one you have a 7 digit number called any six of them please. I think I had 5 numbers I have for 504 4875 to do about the number six same as she did okay loud and clear. I think you left out the numbers 3 that's 3 the odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000 10 to the 4th power okay. really traveling up this time please. is it at the number seven and left you all four of these people and I found of a floss thank you very much. thank you. for my next number. well I mentally recharge my batteries I have one more question for the Audience by any chance does anybody here happen to know the day of the week that they were born on if you think you know your birthday raise your hand what's the starting with the gentleman first what year was it first of all. 1953 in the month November what. 23rd was that a Monday yes good somebody else who else would like to know what year. 19:49 in the month October what fifth was that a Wednesday yes my way to the back right now how about you yell it out what year. 1959 okay on the month. February 6th was that a Friday good person behind her what year was it 1947 in the month May 7th was a Wednesday thank you very much. anybody here who'd like to know the day of the week they were born we could do it that way so I come prepared for that I brought with me a book of calendars goes as far back in the past as 1800 cuz you never know. I didn't mean to look at you so you are Jessica sitting there anyway you can help me out here if you wouldn't mind this is a book of calendars and I'll ask her who was it the one that's another birthday what year was it first of all 66 turn to the calendar with 1966 and and what month April 17th I believe that was a Sunday and you confirm press. yeah okay I'll tell you what Chris as long as you have that book book in front of you do me a favor turn to a year outside of the $1,900 in the 1800's were way into the 2,000 that will be a much greater challenge for me what year would you like 24 1824 okay and what month it was and it was cloudy good thank you very much. but I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation either it was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator where is he would you stand up 10-digit guy. okay stand up for me just for a second so I can so I can see where you are but I'm going to try and do is to square in my head a five-digit number requiring a 10-digit calculator to make my job more interesting for you as well as for me I'm going to do this problem thinking out loud so you can actually honestly hear what's going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this side now I have to apologize to our magician friend Leonard green I know is a magician we're not supposed to reveal our secrets but I'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week so I think we're okay. so let's see what's take a take a different role of people starting with you then I'll get five digits 1 2 3 4 or before you 1 2 3 4 5 quad a single-digit that will be the 5-digit number that I will try to square go ahead 5. 768-350-7683 squared yuck. let me let me explain to you how I'm going to attempt this problem going to break the problem down into three parts I'll do 57000 squared + 683 squared + 57000 * 683 * 2 and all those numbers together and with any luck arrive at the answer now let me recap. thank you. while I explain something else. I don't that you can do is write while I do these calculation you might hear certain words as opposed to numbers creep into the calculation let me explain what that is this is a phonetic code a mnemonic device that I use that allows me to convert numbers into words I store them his words and later on retrieve them as numbers I know it sounds complicated it's not I just don't want you to think you're seeing something out of rain man here there's definitely a method to my madness definitely definitely.you want to talk to me about ADHD afterwards you can talk to me by the way for my judges with the calculators okay you know who you are there is at least a 50% chance that I will make a mistake here if I do don't tell me what the mistake is just say your clothes or something like that and I'll try and figure out the answer which can be pretty entertaining and itself if however I am right whatever you do don't keep it to yourself okay make sure everybody knows that I got the answer right cuz this is my big finish okay so without any more stalling. here we go I thought the problem in the middle of 57 * 683 + 57 * 68 + 3400 + 476 + 3876 + 38760 + 17138 + 38000 930-130-8009 31 double tap to get 77,000 860-270-7008 62 becomes cookie fish and chip cookie fishing the 77822 that seems right I'll go on cookie Fishin okay 3249 so I can say 3 billion take the 249 and that took cookie 249 but I see a Carrie coming to 49 cookie 250 + 77 is 327 million fishing fishing okay finally we do 683 squared + 700 * 666 + 17 squared + 466000 for 89 rev up if I need it rather take a 466a have that sufficient to get. 320 8489 good thank you very much. I hope you enjoy mathematics thank you",0.734375,

I mean don't get me wrong calculus is an important subject is one of the great products of the human mind the laws of nature are written in the language of calculus and every student who studies math science engineering economics they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college but I'm here to say as a professor of mathematics that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious meaningful way in their day-to-day lives on the other hand statistics that's a subject that you could and should use on a daily basis it's risk its reward its Randomness it's understanding data I think if our students of our high school students if the American citizen knew about probability and statistics we wouldn't be in the economic mess that were in today not only think it's not only that if it's taught properly if it can be a lot of fun I mean probability and. what's the mathematics of games and gambling it's it's the analyzing trends of predicting the future look the world has changed from analog to digital and it's time for our Mathematics Curriculum to change from analog to digital to them from the more classical continuous mathematics to the more modern discrete mathematics the mathematics of uncertainty of randomness of data in being probability and statistics in summary instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean mean and I needed thank you very much,0.8203125,0.8203
30,ArthurGanson_2004.sph.wav,and this is one that i did probably like when i was around seventh grade and i remember when i was doing this i was thinking about that little rock there and the pathway of the vehicles as they would fly through the air and how the characters would come shooting out of the car so on my mind i was thinking about the trajectory of the vehicles and of course when you're a little kid there's always destruction so it has to end with this gratuitous violence so that was how i first started to explore the way things moved and expressed it now when i went to college i found myself making fairly complicated fragile machines and this really came about from having many different kinds of interests when i was in high school i loved to program computers so i sort of liked the logical flow of events i was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surgeon it meant working with my hands in a very focused intense way so i started taking art courses and i found a way to make sculpture that brought together my love for being very precise with my hands with coming up with different kinds of logical flows of energy through a also working with wire everything that i did was both visual and a mechanical engineering decision at the same time so i was able to sort of exercise all of that now this kind of machine is as close as i can get to painting and it's full of many little trivial end points like there's a little foot here that just drags around in circles and it doesn't really mean anything it's really just for the sort of joy of its own connection i have with engineering is the same as any other engineer in that i love to solve problems i love to figure things out but the end result of what i'm doing is really completely ambiguous that's pretty ambiguous the next piece that is going to come up is an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex i gave myself the problem since i'm always liking to solve problems i gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction and solving all of the mechanical problems for getting this little man to walk back and forth kind of as a way of surviving i would go into my own very personal space and i would make things so when i started this i didn't have an overall plan for the machine but i did have a sense of the gesture and a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space and then it was a matter of starting from one point and sort of building to that final point it really it's almost like doing it came about from playing with this wishbone after dinner you know they say never play with your food but i always play with things so i had this wishbone and i thought it's kind of like a cowboy who 's been on his horse for too long and i started to make him walk across the table and i thought oh i can make a little machine that will do that make things for people as a way of you know giving showing them my love i would go into these private places and i would put my ideas so i made this device linked it up and the wishbone walks and because the wishbone is bone it's animal it's sort of a point where i think we can enter into it this kind of work is also very much like puppetry where the found object is in a sense the puppet and i'm the puppeteer at first because i'm playing with an object but then i make the machine which is sort of the stand in for me and it is able to achieve the action that i want the next piece i'll show you is a much more conceptual thought and it's a little piece called cory 's yellow chair i had this image in my mind when i saw my son 's little chair and i saw it explode so the way i saw this in my mind at first was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed and the pieces would move far out then they would begin to be pulled back with a kind of a gravitational feel to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center and they would coalesce for just a moment and my passions into objects and sort of learning how to speak with my hands so the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects is very much connected so you could perceive that there was a chair there for me it's kind of a feeling about the fleetingness of the present moment and i wanted to express that now the machine is in this case it's a real approximation of that because obviously you can't move physical matter infinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously this whole thing is about four feet wide and the chair itself is only about a few inches on the left and it goes through a gear train there are twelve pairs of fifty to one reductions so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once so i've invented it in concrete because it doesn't really matter all the now a completely different thought i'm always imagining myself in different situations i'm imagining myself as a machine what would i love i would love to be bathed in oil so this machine does nothing but just bathe itself and it's really just sort of for me it was just really about the lusciousness of oil i got a call from a friend who wanted to have a show of erotic art and i didn't have any pieces but when she suggested to be in the show this piece came to mind so it's sort of related but you can see it's much more overtly erotic with not only the idea realm but also with very much the feeling realm this is a happy machine i'll tell you it's definitely happy from an engineering point of view this is just a little four bar linkage and then again this is a found object a little fan that i found and i thought what about the gesture of opening the fan and how simply could i state something and in a case like this i'm trying to make something which is clear but also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or plant for me the process is very important because i'm inventing machines but i'm also inventing tools to make machines and the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning so this is a little wire bending tool after many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers i made that tool and then i made this other tool for sort of centering gears very quickly and my life completely changed when i found a spot welder the ideas are very disparate i'm going to show you many different kinds of pieces and there's no real connection between one or the other except that they sort of come out of my brain and that was that tool it completely changed what i could do now here i'm going to do a very poor job of silver soldering this is not the way they teach you to silver solder when you're in school i just like throw it in i mean real jewelers put little bits of solder so that's a finished when i moved to boston i joined a group called the world sculpture racing society and the idea their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best it would be whatever came across the finish line so i made this is my first racing sculpture and i thought oh i'm going to make a cart and i'm going to have it i'm going to have my hand writing faster so as i run down the street the cart 's going to talk to me and it's going to go faster faster so that's what it does then in the end what i decided was every time you finish writing the word i would stop and i would give the card to somebody on the side of the road so i would never win the race because i'm always stopping now i only have two and a half minutes i'm going to play this is a piece that for me is in some ways the most complete kind of piece because when i was a kid i also played a lot of guitar and they're all different sort of thoughts that are triggered by looking at life and seeing nature and seeing objects and just having kind of playful random thoughts about things and when i had this thought i was imagining that i would make i would have a whole machine theater evening where i would you would have an audience the curtain would open and you'd be entertained by machines on stage so i a very simple gestural dance that would be between a machine and just a very simple chair and i'm making these pieces i'm always trying to find a point where saying something very clearly and it's very simple but also at the same time it's very ambiguous and i think there's a point between simplicity and ambiguity which can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it and that leads me to the thought that all of these pieces start off in my own mind in my heart and i do my best at finding ways to express them with materials and it always feels really crude it's always a struggle but somehow i manage to sort of get this thought out into an object and then it's there ok it means nothing at all the object itself just means nothing once it's perceived and someone brings it into their own mind then there's a cycle that has been completed and to me that's the most important thing because ever since being a kid i've wanted to communicate my passion and love and that means the complete cycle of coming from inside out to the physical to someone perceiving so i'll just let this chair when i was a child i started to explore i fell in love with the way things moved so i started to explore motion by making little,1,"a few words about how I got started, and it has a lot to do with happiness actually when I was a very young child I was extremely introverted and very much to myself and kind of has a way of surviving I I would go into my own very personal space and I would make things make things for people is the way of you no different showing the my my love I would I would go into these private places and I would put my ideas and my passions into objects instead of learning how to how to sleep with my hands so the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects is very much connected with not only the idea around but also very much the feeling Realm. and the ideas are are very disparate I want to show you many different kinds of pieces and there's no real connection between one of the other except that they should have, but my brain and they're they're all different sort of thoughts that are triggered by by looking at life and seeing seeing nature and seeing objects than just having having kind of playful random thoughts about things the what when I was a child I I started to explore motion I fell in love with the way things moved so I started to explore motion by by making little flip books. and this is what I did probably like when I was around 7th grade and I remember when I was doing this I was thinking about that that Little Rock there and the pathway of the vehicle as they would fly through the air and how the the the characters would come shooting out of the car so on my mind I was thinking about the trajectory of. the vehicles and of course when you're a little kid there's always destruction so it has to end with this gratuitous violence. so that was that was how I first started to explore the way things moved and expressed it now when I went to when I went to college I I found myself making fairly complicated fragile machines and this really came about from having many different kinds of interest when I was in high school I left the program computers so I could have like the cup the The Logical flow of events I was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surgeon because it meant working with my hands in a very focused intense way I found a way to make sculpture that brought together my love for being very precise with my hands with with coming up with different kinds of logical flow. of energy through a system and also working with wire every thing that I did was was both a visual and a mechanical engineering decision the same time so I was able to put an exercise all of that now this this kind of machine is as close as I can get to painting and it's it's full of many little trivial endpoints like there's a little foot here. Just drags around in circles and it doesn't really mean anything it's really just just for the 3rd of July if it's on. triviality the connection I have with engineering is the same as any other engineer in that I love to solve problems I left to figure things out but the end result of what I'm doing is really completely ambiguous. that's pretty ambiguous. the next the next piece that is going to come up with is an example of a kind of machine that is. is fairly complex. I gave myself the problem since I'm always liking to solve problems I gave myself the problem of turning a crank in One Direction and solving all of the mechanical problems for getting this little man to walk back and forth. so when I started this I didn't have an overall plan for the machine. but I did have a sense of the gesture and a sense of the shape and how it occupies space and then it was a matter of starting from one point and sort of building to that final point. that little deer their switches back and forth to change direction that's a little found-object. so a lot of the pieces that I've made date they involve found objects. and it it really is it's almost like it's it's like it's like doing visual puns all the time when I see objects I imagined them in motion I imagine what can be said of this next one here machine with Wishbone it came about. it came about from from playing with this Wishbone after dinner you know they say never play with your food but I always play with things so I ice I had to switch phone and I thought it's kind of like a cowboy has been on his horse for too long and I started to make him walk across the table and I thought I can make a little machine that will do that. so I made this device linked it up. and the wishbone walks and because the wishbone is bone is animal it's a good sort of a point where I think we we we can enter into it. that's a whole case it's that's about that big. it's also very much this kind of work is also very much like puppetry where the found object is innocence the puppet and I'm the Puppeteer at first because I'm playing with an object but then I make the machine which is sort of the stand-in for me and it is able to achieve the action that I want. the next piece I'll show you is a much more conceptual thought and it's a little piece called Cory's yellow chair I had this image in my mind that I sought my son's little chair and I saw it explode up and out and. so the way I saw this in my mind at first with the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed in the pieces would move far out and then they would begin to be pulled back of the kind of a gravitational field to the point where they would they they would approach infinite speed back to the center and they would call us for just a moment so you can you could perceive that there was a chair there for me it's kind of a feeling about the fleetingness of the present moment I wanted to express that now the machine is in this case it's a it's a real approximation of that cuz obviously you can't move physical matter infinitely with infinite speed and have a stop instantaneously. this whole thing is about 4 ft wide and the chair itself is only about a few inches.now this this is a funny sort of conceptual thinking and yesterday were talking about Danny Hillis has 10,000 years so we have a motor here on the left and it goes to a gear train there are 12 pairs of 52 one reductions so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end is so slow that it would take 2 trillion years to turn once so I've invented it in concrete cuz it doesn't really matter cuz it could run all the time. no a completely different thought I'm I'm always imagining myself in different situations I'm imagining myself as a machine what would I love I would love to be bathed in oil. so this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in oil. and it's really it's really just hard for me it was just really about the lusciousness of oil. and then I got a I got a call from a friend who wanted to have a show of erotic art and I didn't have any pieces but when she suggested to be in the show this piece came to mind so it's sort of related but you can see it's much more overtly erotic. and that's why I call machine with grease. it's just continually jaculating and it's this is a happy machine I'll tell you. definitely happy. from an engineering point of view this is just a little four-bar linkage and then again this is a found-object a little fan that I that I found that I thought what about the gesture of opening the fan and how how simply could I State something and in a case like this I'm trying to make something which which is clear but also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or plant. for me though. The process is very important because I'm inventing machines but I'm also inventing tools to make machines and it the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning so this is a little wire bending tool after many years of vending gears with a pair of pliers I made that tool and then I made this other tool for said of centering gear is very quickly. sure developing my own little world of technology my life completely changed when I found a spot welder and that was that tool it completely change what I like to do now here I'm going to do a very poor job of silver soldering. this is not the way they teach you to Silver solder. when you're in school I just like throw it in I mean Real Jewelers put a little bit of solder in the. so that's what that's a finished gear. and when I move to Boston I joined a group called The World sculpture racing society and the idea there. their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best it would be whatever came across the Finish Line first would be the winter so I need I need this is my first racing stuff here and I thought I got to make a heart and I want to have it I'm going to have my handwriting faster so as I run down the street the carts going to talk to me it's going to go faster faster so that's what it does. but then in the end in the end what what what I decided was every time it finished writing the word I would stop and I would give the car to somebody on the side of the road so I can so I would never win the race cuz I'm always stopping. I had a lot of fun. now I only have two and a half minutes I want to play this this this is a piece that's for me is. in some ways the most complete kind of pages because when I was a kid I also played a lot of guitar and this when I had this thought I was imagining that I would make I would have a whole machine theater evening where I would where you would have an audience the curtain was open and you be entertained by machines on stage so I imagined a very simple gestural dance that that would be between a machine and just a very simple chair. end. what I'm making these pieces I'm always trying to find a point where. where I'm where I'm saying something very clearly and it's it's it's it's very simple but also at the same time it's very ambiguous and I think there's a point between Simplicity and ambiguity which can allow a viewer to perhaps to take something from it. stand and that leads me to the thought that all of these pieces start off in my own mind in my heart and I do my best at finding ways to express tan with materials and it always feels really crude it's always a struggle. but somehow I managed to get this thought out into an object and then it's there okay it needs nothing at all the object itself just made nothing once it's perceived and. someone brings it into their own mind then there's a cycle that has been completed and to me that's the most important thing because ever since being a kid I wanted to communicate my passion and love and it's then that means the complete cycle of coming from inside out to the physical to to someone perceiving it. so I'll just let this chair come down. thank you",0.7903646230697632,
31,ArthurPottsDawson_2010G.sph.wav,floor sustainable recyclable chairs recycled and recyclable tables forestry commission this is norwegian forestry commission wood this bench although it was uncomfortable for my mom she didn't like sitting on it so she went and bought these cushions from a local jumble sale reusing a job that was pretty good i hate waste especially walls if they're not working put a shelf on it which i did and that shows all the customers my products the whole business is run on sustainable energy this is powered by wind all of the lights are daylight bulbs paint is all low volume chemical which is very important when you're working in the room will they outlive me they probably might right here 's a reconditioned coffee machine it actually looks better than a brand new one so looking good there now reusing is vital and we filter our own water we put them in bottles refrigerate them and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again here 's a great little example if you can see this orange tree it's actually growing in a car tire which has been turned inside out and sewn up it's got my compost in it which is growing an orange tree which is restaurants and the food industry in general are pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world for every calorie of food we consume the kitchen which is in the same room i basically created a menu that allowed people to choose the amount and volume of food that they wanted to consume rather than me putting a dish down they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they okay it's a small kitchen it's about five sq meters it serves two hundred and twenty people a day we generate quite a lot of waste this is the waste room i compost it in this garden all of the soil you can see there is basically my food which is generated by the restaurant and it's growing in these tubs which i made out of storm felled trees and wine casks and all sorts of things three compost bins go through about seventy kilos of raw vegetable waste a week really good makes fantastic compost a couple of wormeries in there too and actually one of the wormeries was a big wormery i had a lot of worms in it seeing here is a water filtration system this takes the water out of the restaurant runs it through these stone beds this is going to be mint in there and i sort of water the garden with it and i ultimately want to recycle that put it back into the loos maybe wash hands with so water is a very important aspect i started meditating on that and created a restaurant called waterhouse if i could get waterhouse to be a no carbon restaurant that is consuming no gas to start with that would be great i managed to do it this is an electrical restaurant the whole thing is electric the restaurant and the kitchen and it's run on hydroelectricity so i've gone from air to water this is basically air handling i'm taking the temperature of the canal outside pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof and that in turn is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant cooling them or heating them as the this is an english willow air diffuser and that's softly moving that air current through the room very advanced no air conditioning i love it in the canal which is just outside the restaurant there is hundreds of meters of coil piping this takes the temperature of the canal and turns it into this four degrees heat exchange i have no idea how it works but i paid a lot of money for it and what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant lives on this boat it's off grid it generates all its own power he 's growing all his own fruit and that's fantastic if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later you're very welcome to the humble potato and i've spent a long time twenty five years preparing these and it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime five restaurants based on the five chinese medicine acupuncture specialities i've got water and wood i'm just about to do fire to come so you've got to watch your space for that okay so this is my next project five weeks old it's my baby and it's people i e perhaps more working class or people who actually believe in a cooperative this is a social enterprise not for profit it really is about the social disconnect between food communities in urban settings and their relationship to rural growers that's zero food waste and no one 's doing that just yet in fact sainbury 's if you're watching try it on i'm going to get there before you so nature and that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time and it's an important statement to understand if we don't stand up and make a difference and think about sustainable food think about the sustainable nature of it then we may fail but i wanted to get up and show you that we can do it if we're more first of all it's planted and that takes energy it grows and is nurtured it's then harvested the idea is embryonic i think it's important i think that if we reduce reuse refuse recycling is the last point i want to make but it's the four r 's rather than the three r 's then i think we're going to be on our way so these three are not perfect they're ideas i think that there are many problems to come but with help i'm sure i'm going to find solutions and i hope you all take part thank you very much it's then distributed and distribution is a massive issue it's then sold and bought and it's then delivered to me i basically take it prepare it and okay you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like basically a restaurant just like any other this is the restaurant acorn house front and back so let me run you through a few ideas,1,"restaurants on the food industry in general he's pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world for every calorie of food we consume in Britain today 10 calories into producing that's a lot I don't want to take something rather humble to discuss I found this in the farmers market today and if anybody wants to take time and I should like to you're very welcome to the humble potato and I spent 25 years preparing these and it pretty much goes through eight different forms and its lifetime customer was planted and that takes energy it's so gross and is not just how it is then harvested it's been distributed and distribution is a massive issue it's been sold and bought and it's been delivered to me you know if I should take it repair it and then people consumed it hopefully they enjoy it and the lost age is basically waste and this is pretty much where everybody just disregards it there different types of waste. there's a waste of time that's why it's the spice that is waste of energy and there's a waste of waste and every business I've been working whenever the past five years I'm trying to love each one of those elements okay so I'm going to ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like basically a restaurant looks like just like any other this is the restaurant front and back so few ideas flow sustainable responsible chairs recycled and recyclable forestry commission that this is Norwegian forestry commission would they spent it was uncomfortable my mom and she's not sitting on it so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale reusing. It was pretty good I hate waste especially wolves they're not working for the shelf on it which I did not shower I was with a customer is my products the whole business is wrong with stainable Angie this is powered by wind would like to buy light bulbs pain is a chemical which is very important when you're working in the room. I was experimenting with these whenever you say it but there's this sort of work surface that and that's a plastic polymer and I would lay out with me I probably might try is a reconditioned coffee machine actually looks better than a brand new one so we can go there now reusing is vital and we put them in bottles refrigerator and we we use that bottle again and again and again until he can see his orange trees growing in a car tire has been turned inside out some orange cream cheese rights it's the kitchen is in the same room right to the menu to allow people to choose the amount and the volume of food that they wanted to consume problem me putting it this down they were allowed to help themselves as much support as long as they want it. okay it's a small kitchen is about 5 square meters it says 220 people a day we generate quite a lot waste is the white room that you cannot get rid of waste but this too is know about eliminating it about minimizing it in here or I have told you some boxes that are unavoidable I put my food waste into this dehydrating desiccating macerator Sons food into a an inert material which I can stool and then compost lighter I can post it in this Garden all you can say that especially my food which is generated by the restaurant and it's growing in these tubs which I might have assumed felt trees in one coffiest new cons of things 3 compost bins out really good. She wanted was a big one right now had a lot of guns in it and I tried taking the dry food waste putting into the ones that they go then I was like you know vegetable Jackie. it's like I don't know how many runs in there but I got some heavy, coming until you. this is this is what you saying here is a is a water filtration systems is steak supposed to answer the restaurant runs it to release a song by this commitment in there and then I should have water the garden with an ultimately want to recycle a blues maybe more times without an important aspect so I can call the restaurant that is consumed in the gas to start with that would be great managed to do it this restaurant looks a little like this is an electrical restaurant the whole thing is electric the restaurant and the kitchen and is well-known hydroelectricity something from air to water now you know this room is it school by water heated buy water filters. and just because I thought it was too much been something going on that this is basically are handling I'm taking the temperature at the canal outside pumping it through heat exchanger mechanism is cutting into these amazing sales in the roof and I am done is falling Softly on the table in the restaurant cooling and heating and I need my bae and this is the English Willow a diffuser and that's a really moving that the room air conditioning I love it in the canal which is just outside the restaurant there's hundreds of metres of cord piping this type the temperature of the canal and turned it into this food agrees and he can change a lot of money for it. I was surprised when the chefs who works in a restaurant lives on this phone is off. If he's going he's going to put us at the element of water and I'm thinking oh I'm going to be making five restaurants by Saint the five Chinese medicine acupuncture waterwood I'm just about to fall out or not to come for that project and it's hurting real bad the people Supermarket so basically the restaurant's only really hit people who believed in what I was doing anyway what I needed to do is get food out to a broad spectrum of people so people I have some more in class or perhaps people who actually believe in a Cooperative this is a social Enterprise not-for-profit Cooperative it really is about. social disconnect between food communities in oven settings and their relationship to Route drivers connecting communities in London to reply with really important so I'm committing to the title welcome committee to leak some broccoli or very important stuff going some recycled fridges and got some recycle Tails controllers I mean the whole thing is stupid signable in fact I'm trying and I'm going to make this the most sustainable supermarket in the world that the zero food waste and no one's doing that just yet if I do size Reese's you watching Tryon I'm going to get there before you okay doesn't create waste as such everything in night shift is used up in the clothes continuous cycle with waste bin the end of the beginning and that's kind of been something that's been bugging me for some time it's an important. statements Wonder stand if we don't stand out and and and make a difference and them you know think about sustainable food think about the sustainable nature of it then we may file but I want to get up and show you that we can do it if we more responsible environmentally conscious businesses all doable that here at 3 so far the only thing is embryonic I think it's important I think that if we reduce reuse refuse and recycling the Lost points on tonight in 3 hours then I think we're going to be on our way. Perfect their ideas I think that there are many problems to come Bop with help I'm sure I'm going to find Solutions and them if you will take pop thank you very much. I'm doing the creative Direction the magazine I work as a photographer I also have been curating I do anything and everything related to photography that I do see is a Pioneer art and culture Journal we know so many creative people and we wanted to sort of give people form to do projects that they might not be able to do for other magazines my Blackberry works with my lifestyle because I actually work for my phone going back and forth with different clients constantly if we're planning an issue of the magazine I'm looking at proofs on my phone the new one has a a keypad and also a touchscreen I really like the keypad I could not write long emails on a phone but just had a touch screen there's no way. I started taking pictures seriously when I was about Seventeen but I just didn't think it was going to be my job up until very recently all of my personal work with pictures of just like what was around me phone in sitting room with friends I usually have my camera take a picture when I see Connie. the quality of the camera on the BlackBerry is definitely good enough that I can do almost anything I want online with him I contribute to a couple different blogs aside from the dossier bought a lot of pictures from wherever I am taking with my Blackberry this is Rainbow Eucalyptus in Maui and it it grows by the side of the road was taken from the top of the pompidou in Paris the line to get in does a hedgehog in the souk in America the inside of my dog's mouth I just travel a lot for work you know I have my phone with me everywhere I go Works anywhere in the world and that's awesome",0.6875,"0.6641,0.7109,0.6667,0.7109"

33,AshrafGhani_2005G.sph.wav,the aid system does not have the knowledge the vision the ability i'm all for it after all i raised a lot of to be exact you know i managed to persuade the world they had to give my country twenty seven point five billion they didn't want to give us the money ca and it still didn't work ag no it's not that it didn't work it's that a dollar of private in my judgment is equal at least to twenty dollars of aid in terms of the dynamic that it generates second is that one dollar of aid could be ten cents it could be twenty cents or it could be four dollars it depends on what form it comes what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it the aid system at first was designed to benefit entrepreneurs of the developed countries not to generate growth in the poor countries and this is again one of those assumptions the way car seats are an assumption that we've inherited in governments and you would think that the us government would not think that american firms needed subsidizing to function in developing countries provide advice but they do an entire weight of history vis a vis aid that now needs to be reexamined if the goal is to build states that can credibly or how provisional our consensus to be able to move forward but the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems take care of themselves and i'm putting that proposition equally you know i'm very harsh on my counterparts in each country in a definable period and every year there must be progress on mobilization of domestic revenue and generation of the economy unless that kind of compact is entered into you will not be able to sustain the most of the globe experiences the state as repressive as and in terms of experience of capitalism there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences first extractive industry blood diamonds smuggled emeralds timber that is cut right from under the poorest second is technical assistance and technical assistance might shock you but it's the worst form of today of the ugly face a public dewey long ago observed is constituted through discussion and debate if we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question of the developed world to the developing countries tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to one thousand five hundred dollars a day we do not live in three different worlds we live but that's easily said but we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living and that is that if we want to have one world this one world cannot be based on huge pockets of exclusion and then inclusion for some we must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global this open moment in history where we have a consensus on both the form of politics and the form of economics what is one of these organizations to pick we have three critical terms economy civil society and the state i will not deal with those first two except to say that uncritical transfer of assumptions from one context to another can only make for disaster economics in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context my country is dominated by drug economy and a mafia avoid doxa the realm of the unquestioned then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions and not imposition of the framework that works on the basis of mathematical modeling for which i have enormous respect my colleagues at johns hopkins were among the best second instead of debating endlessly about what is we hope to share that much widely with and third is that we could actually construct an index to measure comparatively how well these functions that we would agree on are being performed in different places so what are these functions we propose ten and it's legitimate monopoly of means of violence administrative control management of public finances investment in human capital provision of citizenship rights to debate and discussion it is in this spirit that i i won 't elaborate i hope the questions will give me an opportunity this is a feasible goal basically because contrary to widespread assumption i would argue that we know how to do this who would have imagined but people at oxford prepared for a democratic germany and engaged in planning and there are lots of other examples now in order to do this and this brings this group we have to rethink the notion of capital the least important form of capital in this project is financial capital money money is not capital in most of the developing countries it's just cash because it lacks the institutional organizational managerial forms to turn it into capital and what is required is a combination of physical capital institutional capital human capital and security of course is critical but so is information now the issue that should concern us here and that's the challenge that i would like to pose to this group is again it takes sixteen years in your countries to produce somebody with a bs degree it takes twenty years to produce somebody with a phd the first challenge is to rethink fundamentally the the time do we need to repeat what is it that we need to do fundamentally to re engage in a project that capital formation is they need different ways of being approached different ways of being enfranchised different ways of being and that's the first thing second is you're problem solvers but you're not engaging your global responsibility away from the problems of corruption you only want clean environments in which to function but if you don't think through the problems of corruption who will you stay away from design for development you're great designers but your designs are selfish it's for your own immediate use the is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work as the work on paradigms long time ago showed thomas kuhn 's work it's in the intersection of ideas that new developments true breakthroughs occur and i hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world 's poor through this means thank you what scares me most is is you lack of your engagement you know i always give the unconventional answer no but seriously the issue of afghanistan first has to be seen as at least a ten to twenty year perspective today the world of globalization is on speed time has been compressed and space does not exist for most people but in my world you know when i went back to afghanistan after twenty three years so the first is when the scale is that we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure it takes six years to deliver infrastructure in our world any meaningful sort of but the modality of attention or what is happening today what's happening tomorrow second is when a country has been subjected to one of the most immense brutal forms of exercise of power we had the red army for ten continuous years one hundred and ten thousand strong literally terrorizing the sky every afghan sees the sky as a source of fear we were bombed practically out of existence then tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism from all sides how to turn a bicycle into an instrument of terror how to turn a donkey a cart horse anything and the russians equally so when violence erupts in a country like afghanistan it's because of that legacy but we have to understand that we've been incredibly lucky i mean i really can't believe how lucky i am here standing in front of you speaking when i joined as finance minister i thought that the chances of my living more than three years would not be more than five percent the question now however is both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation you see because i mean i give you one statistic ninety one percent of the men in afghanistan eighty six percent of the women listen to at least three radio stations in terms of their discourse in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world i think that i much more sophisticated than rural americans with college degrees and the bulk of europeans because the world matters to them and what is their predominant concern abandonment afghans have become deeply internationalist you know when i went back in december of two thousand and one i had absolutely no desire to work with the afghan government because i'd lived as a nationalist and i told them my people with the americans here separate yes i have an advisory position with the u n i went through ten afghan provinces very rapidly and everybody was telling me it was a different world you know they engage they see engagement global engagement as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people and the thing that the ordinary afghan is most concerned with is clare lockhart is here so i'll recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in northern afghanistan and that woman said she didn't care whether she had food on her table what she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future where her children could really have a different life that gives me hope how is afghanistan going to provide alternative income to the many people who are making their living off the drugs trade the first is instead of sending a billion dollars on drug eradication and paying it to a couple of security companies but we must acknowledge that this moment has brought about a rare consensus of assumptions and that they should give this hundred billion dollars to fifty of the most critically innovative companies in the world to ask them to create one million jobs to the drug eradication is jobs look there's a very little known fact countries that have a legal average income per capita of one thousand dollars don't produce drugs if you want us to be able to compete with china and to attract investment we could probably attract four to six billion dollars and we need to understand it's the value chain look and the ordinary afghan is sick and tired of hearing about microcredit it is important but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro production want is global access they don't want to sell to the charity bazaars that are only for foreigners and the same bloody shirt embroidered time and again what we want is a partnership with the italian design firms we have the best embroiderers in the world why can't we do what was done with northern italy with the put out so i think economically the critical issue really is to now think through and what i will say here is that aid doesn't work you know the aid system is broken,1,"a public do we long ago observe is constituted to discussion and debate. if we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question and avoid doxa the realm of the unquestioned then we must be willing to subject their own assumptions to debate and discussion. it is in this spirit that I joined into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time namely how to mobilise different forms of capital for the project of State Building. capitalism after 150 years it's become acceptable and so has democracy. if you looked in the world of 1945. and look at the map of capitalist economies in the mccratic policies they were the rare exception not the norm. the question now however is both about which form of Captain. in which type of democratic participation. but we must acknowledge that this moment is brought about a rare consensus of assumptions. and that provides the ground for a type of action because consensus of each moment allows us to act and it is necessary no matter how fragile or how provision consensus to be able to move forward but the majority of the world. neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems. most of the globe experience the state as repressive as an organization that is concerned about denial of rights about denial of Justice. rather than provisional. and in terms of experience of capitalism there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences first extractive industry. temper. that is cut right from under the poorest second is technical assistance. and technical assistance my truck you but it's the worst form of today of the ugly face. of the of the developer tab to the developing countries. tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to $1,500 a day. what are incapable of thinking creatively or a Galaxy. Nexus action events of July 7th I express my deep to remind us we do not live in three different words. we live in one word. but that's easily said. but we are not dealing with the implications of the one word that we are living. and that is that if we want to have one word this one work cannot be based on huge buckets of explosion and then inclusion for some. we must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly Global worth in relationship to the regime of Rights and responsibilities and accountability that are truly Global in scope otherwise we would be missing. this open moment in history where we have a consensus on both the form of politics in the form of economics. what is one of these organizations to pick me up three critical Trump's economy Society. in the state I will not deal with those first two except to say that uncritical transfer of assumptions from one contacts to another can only make for disaster. economics. taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my contacts. my country is dominated by drug economy and a mafia textbook economics does not work in my contacts and I have been a few recommendations from anybody at the house to put together the poverty of our knowledge must become the first basis of moving forward and not in position of the framework that works on the base of mathematical modeling my colleagues to Johns Hopkins what am I the best. second instead of debating endlessly about what is the structure of the state why don't we simplify and say what are the functions that the 21st century must perform clay Lockhart I writing a book on this we hope to share that much when the internet is that we could actually constructed. how well do functions that you'd agree on or being performed in different places so what are these functions we proposed to end its legitimate means of violence administrative control management of public finances investment human capital provision of citizenship rights provision of infrastructure management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state to regulation creation of the market International agreements including public borrowing and then most importantly. I went to the library. I hope the questions will give me an opportunity this is a feasible gold basically because contrary to widespread assumption I would argue that we know how to do this would have imagined the Germany would be either United or Democratic today if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943. but people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany and engaged and planning. and a lot of America. no in order to do this in the springs this group we have to rethink the notion of capital. capital the least important form of capital in this project is financial Capital Money. money is not capital in most of the developing countries it just cash because it lacks the institutional organizational managerial forms to turn it into. and what is required is combination of physical capital institutional Capital human capital and security of course it's critical that information know the issue that should concern us here and that's the challenge that I would like to to post to this group. is again it takes 16 years. in your countries to produce somebody with a BS degree. it takes twenty years to produce somebody with a PhD the first challenge is to rethink fundamentally the issue of the time. do we need to repeat. the modalities of inherited assistants are inherited from 19th century. what is it that we need to do fundamentally to re-engage in a project that captures formation is wrapped. the absolute majority of the world's population or below 20. and there are growing larger and faster. they need different ways of being approached different ways of being in franchise different ways of being skilled. and that's the second is your problem solvers but you are not engaging your Global responsibility. you stayed away from the problems of corruption. you only one clean environment in which the function but if you don't think through the problems of corruption. you stay away from the sign for development your great designers. but your designs are selfish. it's for your own limited use. the words in which I operate operate with designs regarding roads are dams or provision of electricity that is not visited in 60 years. this is not right it requires thinking but particularly what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination. to be brought to bear on problems the way name is supposed to work. the word competitor in slime long time ago show Thomas Kunz work it's in the intersection of ideas that new new developments to breakthroughs occur and I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of State in development in the empowerment of the majority of the word port to this means thank you. until recently a USA Finance Minister of Afghanistan country right in the middle of much of the world's agenda must. what scares me most is is you like if your engagement. you asked me to be seen as at least attempt to 28 Prospect. today the word of globalization is on speed. time has been compressed in space does not exist for most people. but in my word you know when I went back to Afghanistan after 23 years. space is expanding every conceivable form of infrastructure is broken down a road travel travel between two cities that you should take three hours now Book 12 and this Katie is that we need to recognize that just the simple things that our infrastructure. but the modality of attention or what is happening today what's happening tomorrow when it country has been subjected. one of the most immense brutal forms of exercise of power we had the Red Army for 10 continuous years hundred ten thousand strong. 2010 racing the sky. every every of fun. seize the sky. we've bumped. practically out of existence. then tens of thousands of people who are trained in terrorism. from all sides. the next state Great Britain join for instance Egyptian intelligence service to train thousands of people in resistance in urban Terrace. how to blow out how to turn a bicycle into an investment of Terror. how to turn a donkey a quarter's anything and the Russians equally when violence erupts in a country like Afghanistan it's because of that but we have to understand that we've been incredibly lucky I really can't believe how lucky I am here standing in front of you speaking when I join this finance minister. I thought that the chances of my living more than three years with nothing more than 5%. those are they worth it. I think we can make it and the reason we can make it is because of the people you see because I mean I give you one 91% of the men and 86% of the women. listen to the mystery radio station today. in terms of their discourse in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world. I think that I would dare say that much more sophisticated than Americans with college degrees. end in the back of your pants. because the word mattress and what is the predominant concern abandonment. Uplands become deeply International you know when I went back in December of 2001 I had absolutely no desire to work because my people would not Americans here to separate separate yes I have an advisory position with the UN I went to 10 provinces very rapidly and you know they engage they see engagement Global engagement as absolutely necessary to the future of a look at this here ship types of the site a discussion she had with the elephant woman and she didn't care what you worried about was whether there's a plan for the future with her children. could we have a different life. how is Afghanistan going to provide alternative income to the many people who make making a living off the drugs tried sending a billion dollars on education and paying it to a couple of security companies they should give this hundred billion dollars to 50 of the most critically Innovative companies in the world that hasn't paid 1 Million Dreams. the key to the drug education is just look there's a little-known five countries that illegal average income per capita $1,000 don't produce drugs. second text but. faith is the key Note 8 the US and Europe should give us 0% tariff. the textile Industries incredibly mobile if you want us to be able to compete with China and 46 billion dollars if there was irritated would create the type of job does not compete with a t-shirt.. And we need to understand it's about who is sick and tired of hearing about Michael credit. it is important but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro production Global axis. they don't want to sell to the charity bazaars. that's our only for foreigners unite the same bloody shirt embroidered time and again what we want is a partnership with the Italian design firms. do we have we have the best embroiderers in the world. why can't we do what was done with Northern Italy with the put out. I think it can only be the critical issue really is to nothing through and what I was saying here is that 8 a.m. is broke. date system does not have the knowledge division that ability to be exact and 7.5 billion. it's not that it's that a dollar of private investment. in my judgment is equality $20 of it. in terms of the the dynamic that the January 2nd is that $1 of it could be ten cents it would be $0.20 or $34 it depends on what form it comes what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it first was designed to benefit entrepreneurs of the developed countries not to generate growth in the end this is again one of those assumptions the wait at car seats or an attention that you've inherited and governments and doors you would think that the US government would not think that American firms needed subsidizing to function in developing countries provide advice. it this entire weight of History Visa V8. Nummies video drum. if the goal is to build state that can credibly take care of themselves. it must end in each country in a definable..

34,AubreydeGrey_2005G.sph.wav,of course one can make a biological argument one can say ok what are we made of we're made of cells and stuff between cells what can damage accumulate in the answer is long lived molecules because if a short lived molecule undergoes damage but then the molecule is destroyed like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis then the damage is gone too it's got to be long lived molecules so these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news because it means that you know we've come a long way in biology in these twenty years so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done i haven't got time to go through them at all but my conclusion is that if we can actually get suitable funding for this then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only ten years but we do need to get serious about it we do need to really start trying so of course there are some biologists in the audience and to some of the questions that you may have you may have been dissatisfied with this talk but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff i've published a great deal on this i the experimental work on which my optimism is based and there's quite a lot of detail there the detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that i'm predicting here so if you think that i'm wrong you'd better damn well go and find out why you think i'm wrong i like in an audience in britain especially to talk about the comparison with fox hunting which is something that was banned after a long struggle and of course the main thing is that you shouldn 't trust people who call themselves gerontologists because as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field you know you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously so you know you've got to actually do your homework in order to understand whether this is true with a few things one thing is you know you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in and everyone said well it's obviously impossible and you know what happened so you know this does happen we have various strategies there's the methuselah mouse prize which is basically an incentive to innovate and to do what you think is going to work and you get money for it if you win there's a proposal to actually put together an institute this is what's going to take a bit of money but i mean look how long does it take to spend that on the war in iraq not very long ok it's got to be philanthropic because profits distract biotech but it's basically got a ninety percent chance i think of succeeding in this and i think we by the government not very many months ago i mean i know i'm with a sympathetic audience here but as we know a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic because i am an old man i am actually one hundred and fifty eight on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate which is that no aging is not a product of selection evolution is simply a product of evolutionary neglect in other words and this is actually a rather good comparison it seems to me you know a lot of people said well you know city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time it's a traditional part of the way of life and we should be we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging you need more genetic pathway more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowly and that carries on being true you push it out so to the extent that evolution doesn't matter doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals living a long time or by procreation amount of modulation of that which is why different species have different lifespans but that's why there are no immortal species ca the genes don't care but we do ag that's right hello i read somewhere that in the last twenty years the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by ten years if i project that would make me think that i would live until one hundred and twenty if i don't crash that means that one of your subjects to become a one thousand year old if you i was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo and that the brain cells last eighty years or so if that is indeed true biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation if there are cells in my body that live all eighty years as opposed to a typical you know couple of months there are technical implications certainly basically what we need to do is replace cells in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate especially neurons no aging hydra for example but they do it by not having a nervous system and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long lived cells to carry on doing it it's ecologically sound it stops the population explosion of foxes but ultimately the government prevailed in the end because the majority of the british public and certainly the majority of members of parliament to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society and i think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades what part of this do people not understand it's not just about life it's about healthy life you know getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun and i mean ok i'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless there are some good points to be made here things that we ought to be thinking about forward planning so that nothing goes too well so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging but these are completely crazy when you actually remember your sense of proportion you know these are arguments these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about but the question is are they so dangerous these risks of doing something about aging that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite namely leaving aging as it is are these so bad that they outweigh condemning one hundred thousand people a day to an unnecessarily early death and you know a lot of people try to fudge this question and give answers like this i don't agree with those answers i think they basically don't work i think it's true that we will face a dilemma in this respect we will have decide whether to have a low birth rate or a high death rate a high death rate will of course arise from simply rejecting these therapies in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids and i say that that's fine the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice what's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future if we vacillate hesitate and do not actually develop these therapies then we are condemning a whole cohort of people who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies to talk about feasibility as well of course i'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging and then i'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about but will not be because we haven't developed them as quickly as we could we'll be denying those people an indefinite life span and i consider that that is immoral that's my answer to the overpopulation question right so the next thing is now why should we get a little bit more active on this and the fundamental answer is that the pro aging trance is not as dumb as it looks it's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging aging is ghastly but it's inevitable so you know we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do to do that like for example making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all but of course this becomes part of the problem this pro aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things and that's why we have to really aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place which is to say metabolism this is not you know how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong namely by actually doing something about it i'm going to do that in two steps the first one i'm going to talk about is a completely tautological statement it's a reasonable statement aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars and it also happens to us despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self repair mechanisms because those self repair mechanisms are not perfect so basically metabolism which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next has side effects those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology that's a fine definition so we can put it this way we can say that you know we have this chain of events the geriatrician will intervene late in the day when pathology is becoming evident and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time and stop the but unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well in fact we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work even cells we're not really too good on yet we've discovered things like for example rna interference only a few years ago and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work basically gerontology is a fine approach in the end but it is not an approach whose time has come when we're talking about intervention so then how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension which i'm going to define as thirty years applied to people who are already in middle age when you start to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging namely essentially an elimination of the just suppose as i said that we do acquire let 's say we do it today for sake of argument the ability to confer thirty extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age let 's say fifty five i'm going to call that robust human rejuvenation ok what would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today or equivalently of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive would actually live that question you might think it's simple but it's not simple we can't just say well if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies then they'll live thirty years longer that's the wrong and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs now they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time but after that things were pretty steady and pretty uniform i think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight we can think really that each one is beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one if you like the incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore this is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough and you see it in all sorts of technologies computers you can look at a more or less parallel time line happening of course a bit later you can look at medical care i mean hygiene vaccines antibiotics you know the same sort of time frame so i think that actually step two that i called a step a moment ago isn't a step that in fact the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension even though those people are already middle aged when the therapies arrive will be at some sort of cusp they will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further thirty or maybe fifty years in other words they will be staying ahead of the game the therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us this is a very important point for me to get across because you know most people when they hear that i predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to one thousand or more they think that i'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are but we'll be able to fix the things that two hundred year olds die of before we have any two hundred year olds and the same for three and four hundred and so on i decided to give this a little name which is longevity escape velocity across so these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live in terms of remaining life expectancy as measured by their health given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive if you're already one hundred or even if you're eighty and an average eighty year old we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies because you're too close to death 's door for the really initial eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense in terms of your youthfulness both physical and mental and in terms of your risk of death from of course if you're a bit younger than that then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age related causes so this is a genuine but irrespective of that age i'm claiming that the first person to live to one thousand all right so finally i'm going to spend the rest of the talk my last seven and a half minutes on step one namely how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity and in order to do that i need to talk about mice a little bit i have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation i'm calling it robust mouse rejuvenation not very imaginatively and this is what it is i say we're going to take a long lived strain of mouse which basically means mice that live about three years on average we do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old and then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them and with those therapies we get them to live on average to their fifth birthday i want to ask a question hands up anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria that was easy ok ok hands up anyone in the audience who 's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing and it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question and it's extremely hard to answer one has to be very speculative and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation that we should simply assess their priorities so i say that we have a fifty fifty chance of reaching this rhr milestone robust human rejuvenation within fifteen years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation fifteen years from the robust mouse the public 's perception will probably be somewhat better than that the public tend to underestimate how difficult scientific things are so they'll probably think it's five years away they'll be wrong but that actually won 't matter too much and finally of course i think it's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance i spoke about earlier the coping strategy that will be history at this point because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice so we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people 's attitudes and of course that has enormous implications so in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice i'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging i'm going to use this word damage to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology ok so we all think malaria is a bad thing that's very good news because i thought that was what the answer would be now the thing is i would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with but it is not part of metabolism itself and this turns out to be useful because we can re draw our original diagram this way we can say that fundamentally the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the which metabolism lays down this damage and i'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment and geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology and the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate so there's a third approach if we look at it this way we can call it the engineering approach and i claim that the engineering approach is so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist that causes it to be pathogenic we know that this threshold exists because we don't get age related diseases until we're in middle age even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born why do i say that we're in range well this is basically it the point about this slide is actually the bottom if we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging we will be here all night because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another this list is just for illustration it is incomplete the list on the right is also incomplete it's a list of types of pathology that are age related and it's just an incomplete list but i would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete this is the list of thing that qualify as damage side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end or that might cause pathology and there are only seven of them thing of course but there's only seven of them cell loss mutations in chromosomes mutations in the mitochondria and so on first of all i'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete aging and here is that characteristic the only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria,1,"I'm going to talk about five different things I'm going to talk about why if we can talk about what we have to get outfit together and actually talked about this a bit more than we do. I'm going to talk about feasibility of course I'm going to talk about why we all know why we are we might actually be able to prove fatalism is wrong name Levi actually doing something about it from a modest amount of life extension with a defined I've applied to people who are already in middle age when you start to appoint with the relationship between how old you are and how likely why the guy in the next year or date to get sick in the first place. life extension so I'm going to start with why we should not malaria was a good thing or a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria. I like to talk about the comparison with talk something which is something that was banned after a long struggle by the government as we know a lot of people in it. time it's a traditional part of the way of life and we shouldn't be allowed to carry on doing it it's ecologically sound to members of parliament it's about healthy life miserable and dependent on whether or not dying my refund is the global trance unbelievable excuses that people give for raising and we ought to be thinking about forward planning so that nothing goes to Wild said it would minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging but these are completely crazy when you actually remember. the proportion you know these are all things that you haven't it would be legitimate to be concerned about but the question is so dangerous these risks of the outweigh the bad the downside to an unnecessarily early that you know if you haven't then just don't waste my time. some people do think it is that's going to hear it is and that's what we're not going to be able to have many kids and kids are very important and most people I'm not true and I think they should be done work I think it's true that we will face her in this respect we will have to decide whether to have a low Birthright or high that's right I'm simply reflecting the therapy in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids and I say that that's fine the future of humanity to make that choice on behalf of the future if we have the tight and do not actually develop these therapies then we are condemning people who would have been. healthy enough to benefit from those therapy but will not be because we haven't developed them as quickly as we could we will be tonight in those people and indefinite lifespan right for the next thing I know why should we got a little bit more active on this and the fundamental answer is that the protein count is not as dumb as it looks it's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of 18 so like for example of making up these ridiculous reasons why I think it's actually a good thing after all but of course that only works when we have both of these components might be in range of doing something about aging this becomes part of the problem is what stops are so that's why we have to really. talk about the Lord evangelist I will get people's attention and rehabilitate the fundamental reason I think why we feel that I think is inevitable is summed up in a definition of a simple definition of witty to say my tablet we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms because I'm not perfect but side effects of accumulates and eventually caused pathology definition but we can put it this way we can say that we have a fan of a fan. well I'm going to have to come intelligent person the geriatrics Department the side effects from the guy who looks much more promising because it seemed better than Kayla but unfortunately even if we're not ready to get on the ice and we just got two things like for example I and II interfere interference from the projects whose time has come when it when we talkin about intervention so then I mean. before I tell you why doesn't I'm going to go a little bit and tell you what I'm going to step 2. Suppose that we do a chicken for 30 actually out of healthy life on people who are already in middle age 55 ages today or equipment lady Albury as I do that the time that these therapist arrive would actually live long enough to benefit from therapy it's been dealt with that and the incremental refinement to bed right now they just regret there in time to the predictability of timeframe. very hard to predict how long it going to take to make fundamental rights with a very long time ago that we decide the flying would be fun and it took us until 9 to do it look pretty Saturday I'm pretty uniform I think these are at this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight we can think we reach one is beyond the imagination of the invented the previous one if you like it's a fundamental right fit but I think that actually stepped through that I go to stop a moment ago it was the Step at all that in fact the people who are young enough to benefit from the first therapy. even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapist arrived well we got some sort of course they will mostly survive long enough to receive improve treatment that will get them in other words they will be staying ahead of the kind they will be the therapy will be improving at Foster then the remaining imperfections in the therapy catching up with us this is a very important crossed because you know most people when they had that I protect the people of a lot of people alive today I going to live to 1000 do more thoroughly engaging will be able to fix the things but two hundred yet all died off before we have any 200 year old and it's a 3 of 207. how we would expect people to live in terms of remaining life expectancy as measured by the house if given the ages that they were at the time at least I hope it's a ride if you already a hundred or even a great day and an average therapy for the really initial initial experimental therapies to be good enough for you you won't be able to stand on. I want to look at through biological younger and I'm never ever ever going to get in there to being fragile enough to die of I tried to call me today because we don't know how long it's going to take to get these first generation therapy respective age is actually probably only about 10 years younger than. all right so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the truck I lost 7 and a half minutes to this motor right amount of life extension that will allow us to see what it is I say we going to take a long list kind of mouth which basically means Masters live about three years on average we do exactly nothing to them until they are already two years old and therapies we got them to live on average to the 5th birthday to you as we trouble that remaining life span starting from the point that we started to therapy until we got to the mouth.. function of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things starting from the time we get to my question is what would it do to actually how much people want it and it's extremely hard to answer would have to be very speculative and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation that we should simply be responsible if we stay silent on this we need to get our best guess as to the time frame in order to give people a sense of proportion such as I can assess a priority a fifty-fifty chance of reaching this all right arm after and grab a few minutes ignition within 15 years from the point that we got to write Bassmaster Elite Nation 15 years from the robots math the public perception will probably be somewhat better than that the public can to underestimate how difficult scientific things. the reason why the public is on this fine Saturday at activate my with a very strong change in a little bit to my description of icing I'm going to use this would damage to these intermediate things that are caused by the top of the man that went to the Court, Joliet ventriloquist without the damage itself is cause I'm going with throughout life starting to fall overboard but it is not part of metabolism itself original. This way we can say that fundamentally the difference between gerontology in geriatrics at gerontology tries to inhibit the right at with metabolism lays down this damage. try to hold back the hands of time by stopping the damage that's why we can call it the engineering and Engineering approach is within range. If it's something that we are within range of being able to do because it doesn't involve improving on Eeveelution start to damage completely stressed out like this because we don't get even though. the point about this slide is actually the button because he's been complete & incomplete list of types of things to qualify as a side effect of metabolism that code and I'd like to give you a list of complaints and what kind. I'd like to buy a protein being destroyed by pretty pretty good news because it means that Noah come a long way in biology and E20 as you know how to fix them all in my sin principal and principle is we probably contact us if we can use that if we can actually got kind of a fun thing today then we can probably develop brother in in only 10 years but we do need to get serious about it we do need to really start trying so. I thought I saw it to work on with my optimism is based so if you think that I'm wrong you'd better damn well going to find out why you think I'm wrong that you shouldn't trust people who call themselves departure from previous thinking within a particular field you know what you expect people not and not ready to take a few things one thing is you know you'll be hearing from a guy and the next session who said some time ago and so you know you that does happen we have an incentive to innovate and to do what you think. can you get money for it if you win a proposal to actually put together an Institute this is what's going to take a bit of money but I mean look how much how long does it take to spend it on the war in Iraq not very long it's going to be philanthropic because prophets distract by check but it's basically got a 90% chance I think of. I don't know if it's going to get in touch with me but I thought would get people to Chong aging and why is it that you make yourself look like an old man. species on this planet have evolved with our immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate however as far as I know all the species have evolved to actually died so when cells divide the telomerase get Charlotte and eventually species die so why does evolution has seems to have selected against immortality when it is so advantageous always able to just incomplete thank you for asking a question with an uncontroversial selection simply a product of evolutionary neglect another word we we we have anything because it's hard work not have everything you need in order to write more slowly and that kind of going through the long do you put it down so to the extent that it's it's it's. song by individuals living a long time ago by procreation amount of different species have different lifespans but that's why I don't care but we do that's right. hello I read somewhere that in the last 20 years the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years if I project that that would make me think that I would leave until 120 if I don't crash with my motorbike. that means that I'm one of your subjects to become thousand-year-old. between one and two years but a kite so it's not a possible I was told that we have it's adults are actually in the human embryo and that the brain cells last eighty years or so are there implicate that is indeed true biologically are their implications in the world of Rejuvenation if there are cells in my body that live all 80 years as opposed to typical in a couple of months to replace cells in a few areas of the brain that loose all the respectable right if I finger on it but we don't want to replace the wood would they tried to come to function what I said about there being no. I have another system I'm not having any tissues in fact but rely for that function on very long-lived cell",0.7122396230697632,
35,AuretvanHeerden_2010G.sph.wav,they didn't say money they said the people who employ us treat us like we are less than human please ask them to treat us like human beings that's my simple understanding of human rights in this room everybody out there we can all make a decision to come together and pick up the balls and run with the balls that governments have dropped if we don't do it we're abandoning hope we're abandoning our essential humanity and all of those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in manila these places these origins represent governance gaps that's the politest description i have for them these are the dark pools where global supply chains begin the global supply chains which bring us our favorite brand name products some these governance gaps are run by rogue states some of them are not states anymore at all they're failed states some of them are just countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation is the best way to attract investment promote trade now i didn't come here to depress you about the state of the global supply chain we need a reality check we need to recognize just how serious a deficit of rights we have this is an independent republic probably a failed state it's definitely not a democratic state and right now that independent republic of the supply chain is not being governed in a way that would satisfy us that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption now that's not a new story you've seen the documentaries of sweatshops making garments all over the world even in developed countries you want to see the classic sweatshop meet me at madison square garden i'll take you down the street and i'll show you a chinese but take the example of heparin you expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital probably squeaky clean the problem is is that the active ingredient in there as i mentioned earlier comes from pigs by armed gangs using child slaves what the u n security council calls blood minerals then traveled into some components and ended up in a factory in shinjin in china and when their factory in china which probably is pretty clean is getting all of the ingredients from backyard some of the suppliers realized that they could substitute a product which mimicked heparin in the answer is quite simple the chinese define these facilities as chemical facilities not pharmaceutical facilities so and the u s fda has a jurisdictional problem this is five hundred of these facilities producing active ingredients in china in fact about eighty percent of the active ingredients in medicines now come from offshore particularly china and india and we don't have a governance system we don't have a regulatory system able to ensure that that production we don't have a system to ensure that human rights basic dignity are ensured so at a national level and we work in about sixty different countries at a national level we've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments to regulate the real problem with the global supply chain is that it's supranational so governments who are failing who are dropping the ball that factory over a dozen people have committed suicide already this year at a national level have even less ability to get their arms around the problem at an international level and you can just look at the headlines take copenhagen last year complete failure of governments to do the right thing in the face of an international challenge take the g twenty meeting a couple of weeks ago stepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago you can take any one of the major global simple answer is they can 't they're national one man died after working a thirty six voters are local they have parochial interests they can't subordinate those interests to the greater global public good so if we're going to ensure the delivery of the key public goods at an international level in this case in the global supply chain we have to come up with a different mechanism we need a different machine fortunately we have some examples in the nineteen nineties there were a whole series of scandals concerning the production of brand name goods in the u s child labor forced labor serious health and safety abuses we all love chocolate we buy it for our kids eighty percent of the cocoa comes from cote d 'ivoire and ghana and it's harvested by children how to prevent that but i'm at least going to use my good offices to get you folks together to come up with a response so they formed a white house task force and they spent about three years arguing about who takes how much responsibility in the global supply chain companies didn't feel it was their responsibility those facilities they don't employ those workers they're not legally liable agreed okay what we'll do is we agree on a common set of standards make it part of the contract and that was a stroke of absolute genius because what they did was they harnessed the power of the contract private power to deliver public goods and let 's face it the contract from a major multinational brand to a supplier in india or china has much more persuasive value than the local labor law the local environmental regulations the local human rights standards we have a huge problem of child slaves children have been trafficked from other conflict zones to come and work on the coffee plantations those factories will probably never be amazing if they were able to even if they did their jobs and they cited those facilities for their violations the fine would be derisory but you lose that contract for a major brand name that's the difference between staying in business or going bankrupt makes a difference so what we've been able to do is we've been able to harness the power and the influence of the only truly transnational institution in the global supply chain that of the multinational company and get them to do the right thing get them to use that power for good to deliver the key public goods now of course this doesn't come naturally to multinational companies they weren't set up to do this they're set up to make money but they are extremely efficient organizations they have resources and if we can add the will the commitment they know how to deliver that product heparin blood thinner a pharmaceutical product starts out in artisanal workshops like this in china now getting there is not easy those supply chains i put up on the screen earlier they're not safe space you need a place where people can come together sit down without fear of judgment without recrimination to actually face the problem agree on the problem and come up with solutions we can do it the technical solutions are there the problem is the lack of trust the lack of confidence the lack of partnership between ngo 's campaign groups we can put those two together in a safe space get them to work together we can deliver public goods right now or in extremely short supply this is a radical proposition and it's crazy to think that if you're fifteen year old bangladeshi girl leaving your rural village to go and work in a factory in dhaka crazy multinationals are protecting human rights i know there's going to be disbelief you'll say how can we trust well we and then we publish the results you can call yourself responsible but responsibility without accountability often doesn't work need to believe me you shouldn 't believe me go to the website look at the audit results ask yourself is this company behaving in a socially responsible way can i buy that product without compromising my ethics that's the way the system works i hate the idea that governments are not protecting human rights around the world i hate the idea that governments have dropped this ball and i can't get used to the idea that somehow we can't get them to do their jobs i've been at this for thirty years and in that time i've seen the ability the commitment the will of government to do this decline and i don't see them making a comeback right now so we started out thinking this was a stopgap measure companies and ngo 's are going to have to get together to face the major challenges we are going to face just look at pandemics swine flu bird flu h one n one look at the health systems in so many countries do they have the resources to face up to a serious pandemic could the private sector and ngo 's get together and marshal a response absolutely the second biggest exporter of cotton on earth every year when it comes to the cotton harvest the government shuts down the schools puts the kids in buses what they lack is that safe space to come together agree and move to action that's what we're trying to provide as well that this often seems like overwhelming level of responsibility for people to you want me to deliver human rights it seems too daunting too dangerous for any company to take on but there are companies we have four thousand companies who are members some of them are very very large companies the sporting goods industry in particular stepped up to the plate and have done it the example the role model and whenever we discuss one of these problems that we have to address child labor in cottonseed farms in india this year we will monitor fifty thousand cottonseed farms in india it seems overwhelming the numbers just make you but we break it down to some basic realities and human rights comes down to a very simple proposition can i give this person their dignity back poor people people whose human rights have been violated the crux of that is the loss of dignity the lack of it starts with just giving people back their dignity i was sitting in a slum outside gurgaon just next to delhi one of the flashiest brightest new cities popping up in india right now and i was talking to workers who worked in garment sweatshops down the road and i asked them what message they would like me to take the brands,1,"this telephone.

Heparin blood thinner pharmaceutical product starts out you know teasing and workshops like this in China because the active ingredient comes from hitting just I'm your diamond probably seen the movie Blood Diamond this is a mine in Zimbabwe right now cotton was Becky Stan is the second biggest exporter of cotton on Earth every year when come to the cotton Harvest government shutdown the schools with the kitten buses buses into the cottontails to spend three weeks harvesting the cotton post child labor on an Institutional scale. I know that those products probably in their lives in a dump like this one in Manila these places these Origins represent governance gaps that's the politest description I have foot in. these are the dark pools with Global Supply chains begin the global Supply chains with bring out our favorite brand name products. some of these. governance capsule run by Road States. how many more states that anymore until they failed States some of them are just country to believe that deregulation or no regulation is the best way to attract investment from straight. by the way they're presented us with a huge moral and ethical dilemma. I know that none of us want to be accessories after the fact of a human rights abuse in a global supply chain would like now most of the companies involved in these Supply chains don't have any way of assuring us that nobody had to mortgage the future nobody had to sacrifice their rights to bring out your favorite brand name products. no I didn't come here to depress you about the state of the global supply chain. I will need a reality check when you to recognize just how serious a deficit of Rights we have this is an independent republic probably a failed State definitely noted in the Attic state. and right now that independent republic of the supply chain is not in Gavin in a way that would satisfy us that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption. now that's not a new story you've seen the documentaries of sweatshops making garments over the world even meet me at Madison Square Garden I take you down the street I'll show you a Chinese switch up. but take the example of Heparin the pharmaceutical product you expected the supply chain that gets it to the hospital probably squeaky clean. apartments at the active ingredient in there as I mentioned earlier comes from pigs. the main American manufacturer of that active ingredient decided a few years ago to relocate to China because it's the world's biggest supplier of peace. and when they packed in China which probably is pretty clean is getting all of the ingredients from backyard with family Slaughter pigs an extract ingredient. years ago we had a scandal which killed about 80 people around the world because of contaminants that crept into the Heparin supply chain. what some of the suppliers realized that they could substitute a product which mimicked Heparin in taste. this substitute cost $9 a pound where it's real Heparin be at The Reeling treatment cost $900 a pound. no brainer. I said it kills more people. I thought you're asking yourself how come the US Food and Drug Administration allows this to happen how did the Chinese state agency for Food and Drugs and all this to happen. and the Antichrist simple the Chinese Define these facilities as chemical facilities not pharmaceutical facilities so they don't order them and the jurisdictional problem this is offshore. text me to conduct a few Investigation Services about a dozen a year I might be 20 in a good year the 500 of these facilities producing active ingredients in China alone in fact about 80% of the active ingredients in medicines now come from actual particularly China and India. are we doing have a governance system we don't have a regulatory system able to ensure the that production is. we don't have a system to ensure that human rights spicy dignity or insured. set a national level. and we work in about 60 different countries at a national level we go to scariest breakdown in the ability of governments to regulate. production on their own soil. the real problem with the global supply chain is it a supranational to get me to a failing for dropping the ball at a national level have you been less ability to get their arms around the problem at an international level and you can just look at the headlines take Copenhagen lost you to do the right thing in the face of an international challenge take the G20 meeting a couple of weeks ago. get back from its commitments of just a few months ago. you can take any one of the major Global challenges we've discussed this week and also where is the leadership from government to step up and come up with Solutions with sponsor 2002 National problems and the simple answer is that they caught the national the boat is our local they have parochial interest second subordinators interest to the greater Global public good. so if we can to ensure the delivery of the key public goods and international level in this case in the global supply chain we have to come up with a different mechanism we need a different machine. fortunately we have some examples. in the 1990s they will whole series of scandals concerning the production of brand-name Goods in the u.s. child labor force labor serious health and safety of uses 1996 convened a meeting at the White House invited industry human rights ngos trade unions the Department of Labor I don't want globalization to be a race to the bottom. I don't know how to prevent that but I'm at least going to use my good offices to get you folks together to come up with the response to the arguing about who takes how much responsibility in the global supply chain. company didn't feel it was their responsibilities employers workers are not legally liable. everybody else at the table said folks that doesn't cut it you have a custodial Duty a duty of care to make sure that that product gets from wherever to the store in a way that allows us to consume it not without fear about safety or without having to sacrifice a conscience to consume that product. Zachary. OK Google do is agree on a common set of Standards code of conduct. we'll apply that to a lot of global supply chain regardless of ownership of control will make it part of the contract and that was a stroke of absolute genius because what they did with that harnessed the power of the contract private parlor deliver public goods. and it's I sent the contract from a major multinational brand to supplier in India or China has much more persuasive value than the local a below the local environmental regulations the local human rights standards. those factories will probably never seen inspector inspected it, long to be amazing if they were able to. resist the bribe. even if they did their jobs and they cited those facilities for the violations. Define would be to rise Erie. but you lose that contract for a major brand name that's the difference between. staying in business in bankrupt that makes a difference to what we've been able to do is have been able to harness the power and the influence of the only truly talks National Institution in the global supply chain Battle of the marching National company and get them to do the right thing get them to use that power for good to deliver cheap public goods. of course it doesn't come naturally to multinational companies they weren't set up to do this to make money but they are extremely efficient organization they have resources and if we can add the will the commitment they know how to deliver that product. now getting there is not easy those Supply chains are put up on the screen earlier they not there. you need to take space you need a place where people can come together. sit down without fear of judgment without recrimination. he actually faced the problem agree on the problem and come up with Solutions we can do it the Technical Solutions are there the problem is the lack of trust the lack of confidence the lack of partnership between ngos campaign groups. Civil Society organisations multinational companies we can put those two together in a safe space get them to work together we can deliver public goods it right now on an extremely short supply. this is a radical proposition. and it's crazy to think that you're a fifteen-year-old Bangladeshi go leaving your riddle Village to go to work in a factory in Dhaka. 22-23 for $24 a month. your best chance of enjoying rights at work is if that factory is producing for a brand-name company which you got a code of conduct and made that code of conduct part of. the contract. crazy multinationals of protecting human rights I know there's going to be disbelief you say how can we trust them well we don't the old Arms Control Freight trust but verify. so we wouldn't we take their supply chain we take all the factory names we do a random song. And then we published the results transparency is absolutely critical to this. you can call yourself responsible that responsibility without accountability doesn't work with giving him the tools to deliver this public good respect for human rights. and we checking you don't need to believe me you shouldn't believe me go to the website look at the audit results ask yourself is this company behaving in a socially responsible way can I buy that product without compromising my ethics. that's the way the system works. I hate the idea that governments are not protecting human rights around the world I hate the idea that government have dropped his ball and I can't get used to the idea that somehow we can get them to do their jobs I've been at this for thirty years and in that time I've seen the ability the commitments the will of government to do this Decline and I don't see them making a comeback right now. so we started out thinking this was a stop-gap measure. we now thinking that in fact that is probably the start of a new way of regulating and addressing International challenges. connect Network evidence call it what you will the private actors to have to get together to face the major challenges we are going to fight just look at pandemics swine flu bird flu H1 N1. look at the health systems in so many countries do they have the resources to face up to a serious pandemic. quit the private sector and ngos get together and Marshall a response absolutely. what they lack is a type space to come together agree and move to action that's what we trying to provide. I know as well that this often seems like overwhelming we level of responsibility for people to its you you want me to deliver human rights throughout my Global Supply Chain thousands of suppliers in there. seems too daunting too dangerous for any company to take on but there are a thousand companies who are members. some of them are very very large companies the Sporting Goods industry in particular stepped up to the plate and I've done it. the dump of the role model is there. and we discuss one of these problems that we have to address child labor in cotton seed found in India this year we will monitor 50000 cottonseed phones in India. it seems overwhelming the numbers just make you one of those or not but we break it down to some basic realities and human rights comes down to a very simple proposition can I give this person a dignity back for people people with human rights being violated the cracks on that is the loss of dignity the lack of dignity it starts with just giving people back their dignity I was sitting outside gurgaon just next to daily one of the flashiest brightest cities popping up in India right now. and I was talking to workers who work in the garments which helps down the road and I asked him what message they would like me to take the brands. didn't save money. they said people the people who employ us treat us like we are listing human like we don't exist. please ask him to treat us like human beings. that's my simple understanding of human life that's my simple proposition to you my simple P2 every decision maker in this room everybody out there we can all make a decision to come together and pick up the balls and run with the bulls that governments have dropped if we don't do it. we're abandoning with abandoning our essential humanity and I know that's not a place we want to be and we don't have to be there so few to you join us come into that safe space next door to make this happen thank you very much. I'm doing the great attraction magazine I work as a photographer I also have been curating I do anything and everything related to photography that I can. She is a fly on the wall art and culture Journal we know so many creative people and we wanted to sort of give people for him to do projects that they might not be able to do for other magazines my Blackberry works with my lifestyle because I actually work for my phone going back and forth with different clients constantly if we're planning an issue of the magazine I'm looking at proofs on my phone the new one has a a keypad and then also a touchscreen I really like the keypad I could not write long emails on a phone that just had a touch screen there's no way. I started taking pictures seriously when I was about Seventeen but I just didn't think it was going to be my job up until very recently all of my personal work with pictures of just like what was around me if I when I'm sitting there with friends I usually have my camera to take a picture of what I see Connie. the quality of the camera on the BlackBerry is definitely good enough that I can do almost anything I want online with him I contribute to a couple different blogs aside from the dossier bought a lot of times I'll just send them pictures from wherever I am taking with my locker this is Rainbow Eucalyptus in Maui and it it grows by the side of the road was taken from the top of the pompidou in Paris the line to get in. it's a hedgehog in the souk in America the inside of my dog's mouth I just travel a lot for work you know I have my phone with me everywhere I go Works anywhere in the world and that's awesome",0.6953125,
36,BarbaraBlock_2010Z.sph.wav,same thing with laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes up to the same zone the tunas use you can see why they might be caught then there's george schillinger and our leatherback team out of playa grande tagging leatherbacks that go right past where we are and scott benson 's team that showed that leatherbacks go from indonesia all the way to monterrey there is a gold rush on earth and this is a gold rush for bluefin there are traps that fish sustainably up until recently so what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predators are we can actually see how they're using ecospaces as large as an ocean and from this information we can begin to map the hope spots right so this is just three years of data right here and there's a decade of this data we see the pulse and the seasonal activities that these animals are going on so what we're able to do with this information is boil it down to hot spots four thousand deployments a huge herculean task two thousand tags in an area shown here for the first time off the california coast that appears to be a gathering place and then for sort of an encore from these animals they're helping us they're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down two thousand meters they're taking information from our planet at very critical places like antarctica and the poles those are seals from many countries and then as these animals swim and give us the information that's important to climate issues we also think it's critical to get this information to the public to engage the public with this kind of data we did this with the great turtle race and yet the type of fishing going on today with pens with enormous stakes is really wiping bluefin ecologically off the planet tagged turtles brought in four million hits and now with google 's oceans we can actually put a white shark in that ocean and when we do and it swims we see this magnificent bathymetry that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from california to hawaii but maybe mission blue can fill in that ocean that we can't see we've got the capacity nasa has the ocean we just need to put it together so in conclusion we know where yellowstone is for north america it's off our coast we have the technology that's shown us where it is what we need to think about perhaps for mission blue is increasing the biologging capacity how is it that we can actually take this type of activity elsewhere a lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the golden gate bridge let 's connect the public to this activity right on their iphone that way we do away with a few internet myths so we can save the bluefin tuna we can save the white shark we have the science and technology hope is here yes we can we need just to apply this capacity further in the oceans thank you now bluefin in general goes to one place japan some of you may be guilty of having contributed to the demise of bluefin they're delectable muscle rich in fat absolutely taste delicious and that's their problem we're eating them to death now in the atlantic the story is pretty simple bluefin have two populations one large one small the north american population is fished at about two thousand ton the european population and north african the eastern bluefin tuna is fished at tremendous levels fifty thousand tons over the last decade almost every year the result is whether you're looking at the west or the eastern bluefin population there's been tremendous decline on both sides as much as ninety percent if you go back to lions to certain african elephants and to pandas these fish have been proposed for an endangered species listing in the past two months they were voted on and rejected just two weeks ago despite outstanding science that shows from two committees this fish meets the criteria of cites i and if it's tunas you don't care about perhaps you might be interested that international long lines chase down tunas and bycatch animals such as leatherbacks sharks marlin albatross these animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries the challenge we face is that we know very little about tuna and everyone in the room knows what it looks like when an african lion takes down its prey i doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed this tuna symbolizes what's the problem for all of us in the room and go deep into the seas remotely and we've got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean realm works most of us from the ship even i look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea we don't know where the structure is we can't tell where are the watering holes like we can on an african plain they're the largest of the tunas the second largest fish in the sea bony fish they actually are a fish that is endothermic powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal we can't see the corridors and we can't see what it is that brings together a tuna a leatherback and an albatross we're only just beginning to understand how the physical oceanography and the biological oceanography come together to create a seasonal force that actually causes the upwelling that might make a hot spot a hope spot the reasons these challenges are great is that technically it's difficult to go to sea it's hard to study a bluefin on its turf the entire pacific realm it's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it so the story of our team a dedicated team is fish and chips we basically are taking the same satellite phone parts or the same and for the first time we're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean using light and photons to measure sunrise and sunset now i've been working with tunas for over fifteen years i have the privilege of being a partner with the monterrey bay aquarium we've actually taken a sliver of the ocean put it behind glass and we together have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display when the veil of bubbles lifts every morning we can actually see a community from the pelagic ocean one of the only places on earth you can see giant bluefin swim by we can see in their beauty of form and function their ceaseless activity they're flying through their space ocean space brought in both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity we'd been studying these fish but first we had to learn how to husbandry them what do they like to eat what is it that they're happy with we go in the tanks with the tuna we touch their naked skin it's pretty amazing it feels wonderful and then better yet we've got our own version of tuna whisperers our own chuck farwell alex norton who can take a big tuna and in one motion put it into an envelope of water so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea we're taking this data and building better models and when i see that tuna this is my favorite view i begin to wonder how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did so take a look at that animal that's the closest you'll probably ever get now the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean so in a program called tag a giant we've actually gone ireland to canada from corsica to spain we've fished with many nations around the world in an effort to basically put electronic computers inside giant tunas for ocean swimming it flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins gets lift powers its movements with a lunate tail it's a very hard process but it's a ballet we bring the tuna out we measure it a team of fishers captains scientists and technicians work together to keep this animal out of the ocean for about four to five minutes we put water over its gills give it oxygen and then with a lot of effort and from our data that gets collected when that tag comes back because a fisher returns it for a thousand dollar the size of the biggest tuna we've ever tagged it takes a human effort a team effort to bring the fish in in this case what we're going to do is put a pop up satellite archival tag on the tuna this tag rides on the tuna senses the environment around the tuna and actually will come off the fish detach float to the surface and send back to earth orbiting satellites position data estimated by math on the tag both the electronic tags i'm talking about are expensive these tags have been engineered by a variety of teams in north america they are some of our finest instruments our new technology in the ocean today one community in general has given more to help us than any other community and that's the fisheries off the state of north carolina there are two villages harris and morehead city eight hundred to nine hundred fish in this case we're actually going to measure the fish we're going to do something that in recent years we've started take a mucus sample watch how shiny the skin is you can see my reflection there and from that mucus we can get gene profiles we can get information on gender checking the pop up tag one more time and then it's out in the ocean now bluefin were revered by man for all of human history for four thousand years we fished sustainably for this animal the tuna wants to go it wants to forage on schools of herring but it can't get there it's too cold but then it warms up and the tuna pops in gets some fish maybe comes back to home base goes in again and then comes back to winter down there in north carolina and then on to the bahamas and my favorite scene three tunas going into the gulf of mexico three tunas tagged so from data like this we're able now to put the map up and in this map you see thousands of positions on the hot spots the hope spots they're mixed populations and so what we've done with the science is we're showing the international commission building new models showing them that a two stock no mixing model to this day used to reject the cites treaty that model isn't the right model this is model a model of overlap is the way to move forward so we can then predict where management places should be places like the gulf of mexico and the mediterranean are places where the single species the single population can be captured these become forthright in places we need to protect the center of the atlantic where the mixing is i could imagine a policy that lets canada and america fish because they manage their fisheries well they're doing a good job and it's evidenced in the art that we see from thousands of years ago bluefin are in cave paintings in france they're in coins that date back now in a second project called tagging of pacific pelagics we took on the planet as a team those of us in the census of marine life and funded primarily through sloan foundation and others we were able to actually go in in our project we're one of seventeen field programs and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators not just tunas so what we've done is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in alaska met salmon shark on their home territory them catching salmon and then went in and figured out that if we take a salmon and put it on a line we can actually take up a salmon shark this is the cousin of the white shark and very carefully note i say very carefully we can actually keep it calm put a hose in its mouth keep it off the deck and then tag it with a satellite tag that satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message and that shark leaping there if you look carefully has an antenna it's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon sending home its data and come into monterrey now right next door in monterrey and up at the farallones are a white shark team led by scott anderson there and sal jorgensen they can throw out a target it's a carpet shaped like a seal and in will come a white shark a curious critter that will come right up to our sixteen ft boat it's a several thousand pound animal and three thousand years this fish was revered by humankind it was fished sustainably till all of time except for our generation bluefin are pursued wherever they go we also tag makos with our noaa colleagues blue sharks and now together what we can see on this ocean of color that's temperature we can see ten day worms of makos and salmon sharks we have white sharks and blue sharks for the first time an ecoscape as large as ocean scale showing where the sharks go stick out the tuna and then let them go they get returned and when they get returned here on a nasa our team from ucsc has tagged elephant seals with tags that are glued on their heads that come off when they slough these elephant seals cover half half an ocean,1,"I've been fascinated for a Lifetime by the beauty Form and Function of giant bluefin tuna. Bluefin are warm-blooded like us they're the largest of the tuna has the second largest fish in the sea only fish they actually are a fish that is endothermic power through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal that's one of our Bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium you can see and its shape and it's streamlined design it's powered for ocean swimming it flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins gets lift Powers its movements with illuminate tail it's actually got a naked skin for most of its body so it reduces friction with water this is one of Nature's finest machines. now Bluefin were revered by men for all of human history for 4,000 years we fished sustainably for this animal and it's evidence in the art that we see from thousands of years ago Bluefin are in cave paintings in France there in coins that date back three thousand years this fish was revered by humankind it was fish sustainably till all of time except for our generation Bluefin are pursued wherever they go. there is a gold rush on Earth and this is a gold rush for bluefin there are traps that fish sustainably up until recently. and yet the type of fishing going on today with pens with enormous Stakes is really wiping Bluefin ecologically off the planet that blue fin in general goes to one place Japan some of you may be guilty of having contributed to the demise of bluefin their delectable muscle rich and fat absolutely tastes delicious and that's their problem reading them to death now in the Atlantic the story is pretty simple Bluefin of two populations one large one small the North American population is fish at about 2,000 ton the European population in North African the Eastern bluefin tuna is fished a tremendous levels 50,000 tonnes over the last decade almost every year the result is whether you're looking at the west or the Eastern Bluefin population there's been tremendous to climb on both sides as much as 90% if you go back with your Baseline to 1950. Bluefin it been given a status equivalent to Tigers to Lyons to certain African elephants and two pandas these fish have been proposed for an endangered species listing in the past two months they were voted on and rejected just two weeks ago despite outstanding science that shows from two committees this fish meets the criteria of sightings one and if it's soon as you don't care about perhaps you might be interested that International long lines and persons case down to Nana's and by catch animals such as leatherbacks sharks Marlin Albatross these animals and their demise occurs in the tuna Fisheries. the challenge we face is that we know very little about tuna everyone in the room knows what it looks like when an African lion takes down its prey I doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed this tuna symbolizes what's the problem for all of us in the room it's the 21st century but we really have only just begun to really study our oceans in a deep way technology has come of age that's allowing us to see the Earth from space and go deep into the Seas remotely and we've got to use these Technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how are ocean realm works. most of us from the ship even though I look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous see we don't know where the structure is we can't tell where are the watering holes like we can cut African plain we can't see the corridors and we can't see what it is that brings together a tuna a leather bag and an albatross only just beginning to understand how the physical oceanography in the biological oceanography come together to create a seasonal force that actually causes the upwelling that might make a hotspot I hope spot the reasons these challenges are great is that technically it's difficult to go to see it's hard to study of blue fin on its Turf the entire Pacific realm it's really tough to get up-close-and-personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it and then imagine being Bruce mates team from OSU getting up close to a blue whale and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays and engineer. challenge we've yet to really overcome. so the story of our team a dedicated team is fish and chips we basically are taking the same satellite phone parts or the same parts that are in your computer chip for putting them together in unusual ways and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before and for the first time were able to watch the Journey of a tuna beneath the ocean using light photons to measure sunrise and sunset. now I've been working with Tunas for over 15 years I have the privilege of being a partner with the Monterey Bay Aquarium we've actually taking a sliver of the ocean put it behind glass and weed together have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display when the veil of bubbles lips every morning we can actually see a community from the pelagic ocean one of the only places on Earth you can see giant bluefin swim but we can see in their beauty of Form and Function their ceaseless activity they're flying through their space ocean space and we can bring two million people a year into contact with his fish and show them it's Beauty behind the scenes isn't working Lab at Stanford University partnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium here for over fourteen or fifteen years we've actually brought in both Blue Fin and yellow fin in captivity we've been studying these fish but first we had to learn out of husbandry them what are they like to eat what is it that there. happy with we go in the tanks with the tuna we touch their naked skin it's pretty amazing it feels wonderful and then better yet we've got our own version of tuna Whispers our own Chuck Farwell Alex Norton who can take a Big Tuna and in one motion put it into an envelope of water so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes two not into this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea Jeff and Jason there are scientists were going to take a tuna and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill a flume and that tuna thinks it's going to Japan but it's staying in place we're actually measuring its oxygen consumption its energy consumption we're taking this day done building better models and when I see that tuna this is my favorite view I begin to wonder how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did. so take a look at that animal that's the closest you'll probably ever get. now the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean so in a program called Peggy giant we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada from Corsica to Spain we fished With Many Nations around the world in an effort to basically put electronic computers inside Giant Tunas we actually tagged 1100 Tunas and I'm going to show you three Clips because I tagged 1100 Tunis it's a very hard process but it's a ballet we bring the tuna out we measure it a team of fishers Captain scientists and technicians work together to keep this animal out of the ocean for about 4 to 5 minutes we put water over its gills give it oxygen and then with a lot of effort after tagging putting in the computer making sure the stock is sticking out so it senses the environment we send this fish back into the. and when it goes we're always happy we see a flick of the tail and from our data that gets collected when that tag comes back because of Fisher returns it for $1,000 reward we can get tracks Beneath the Sea for up to five years now on a backbone Danimal. now sometimes the tuna is a really large such as this fish off Nantucket but that's about half the size of the biggest tuna we've ever tagged it takes a human effort a team effort to bring the fish in in this case what we're going to do is put a pop-up satellite archival tag on the tuna this tag rides on the tuna since it's the environment around the tuna and actually will come off the fish detach float to the surface and send back to Earth orbiting satellites positioned data estimated by math on the tag pressure data and temperature data and see what we get them from the pop-up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human interaction to recapture the tag both the electronic Tags I'm talking about are expensive these tags have been engineered by a variety of teams in North America they are some of our finest instruments are new technology in the ocean today. one community in general has given more to help us than any other community and that's the Fisheries off the state of North Carolina there two Villages Hatteras in Morehead City every winter for over a decade held a party called tag a giant and together Fischer's work with us to tag 802-900-5002 met her the fish we're going to do something that in recent years we've started pick up mucus sample what does shiny dusk in it so you can see my reflection there and from that mucus we can get jean profiles we can get information on gender checking the pop-up tag one more time and then it's out in the ocean and this is my favorite with the help of my former post. Gareth Lawson this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna this dude is actually moving on a numerical ocean the warm is the Gulf Stream the cold up there in the Gulf of Maine that's where the tuna wants to go at once to forage and schools of Herring but he can't get there. too cold but then it warms up in the tuna Pops in get some fish maybe comes back to home base goes in again and then comes back to Winter down there in North Carolina and then on to the Bahamas and my favorite scene 32in is going into the Gulf of Mexico three Tunas tagged astronomically were calculating positions they're coming together that could be tuna sex and there it is that is where the tuna spawn them from data like this were able now to put the map up and in this map you see houses of positions generated by this decade and a half of tagging and now we're showing that tunies on the western side go to the Eastern side so two populations of Tunas that is we have a golf population one that we can tag to go to the Gulf of Mexico I showed you that and a second population living among start soon as our North American soon as our European soon as they go back to the med. I'm a hot spots The Hope spot they're mixed population and so what we've done with the science is were showing the international commission building new models showing them that it's to stalk no mixing model to this day used to reject the lady street that model isn't the right model this model a model of overlap is the way to move for it so we can predict where management places should be places like the Gulf of Mexico in the Mediterranean are places where the single species the single population can be captured these become forthright in places we need to protect the center of the Atlantic with a mixing is I can imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish because they manage their Fisheries well they're doing a good job but in the international realm or fishing and overfishing is really gone wild these are the places that we have to make hope spots and that's the size they have to be to protect a bluefin tuna now in its second project called tagging of Pacific. Logix we took on the planet as a team those of us in the census of marine life and funded primarily through Sloan foundation and others we were able to actually go in in our project we're one of 17 field programs and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators not just Tunas so what we've done is actually going up to tag some insurance in Alaska met salmon shark on their home territory followed them catching salmon and then went in and figured out that if we take a salmon and put it on a line we can actually take up a salmon shark this is the cousin of the white shark and very carefully know what I say very carefully we can actually keep it calm put a hole in its mouth keep it off the deck. and then can I get with a satellite tag that satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and sending a message and that shark leaping there if you look carefully has an antenna the free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon sending home its data. salmon sharks are the only sharks we tag but there goes salmon sharks with this m level resolution on a notion of temperature warm colors or warmer salmon sharks go down to the tropics up and come into Monterey now right next door and Monterey and up at the fairlawns or white track team led by Scott Anderson there and sell Jorgensen they can throw out at Target it's a carpet keep like a seal it in will come a white shirt cut curious Critter that'll come right up to her 16 foot boat and several thousand pound animal and we'll wind in the Target and will place an acoustic tag that says I'm shark 10165 or something like that acoustic lie with a ping and then we'll put on a satellite tag that will give us the long-distance Journey with the light faced you locations algorithm solved on the computer that's on the fish. Chinese case that was looking at two tags there and there they are the white sharks of California going off to the white shark Cafe and coming back. we also tagged Mancos with our Noble colleagues blue sharks and now together what we can see on this ocean of color that's temperature we can see 10-day worms of mako's salmon sharks. we have white sharks blue sharks for the first time in ecoscape is largest ocean scale showing where the Sharks go. the tuna theme from Top has done the unthinkable three themes tag 1700 Tunis Bluefin Yellowfin and albacore all at the same time carefully rehearsed tagging programs in which we go out pick up juvenal Tunas put in the tags that actually have the sensors. take out the tuna and then let them go they get returned and when they get returned here on a NASA numerical ocean you can see Bluefin and blue go across their Corridor returning to the Western Pacific. our team from UCSD is tag elephant seals with tags that are glued on their heads that come off when they sloth these elephant seals cover half a notion take data down to 1850 amazing data and then there's Scott Schaefer and a shearwaters wearing tuna tags light-based tags that now we're going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back journeys of 35,000 nautical miles we had never seen before but now would like based you location tags that are very small we can actually see these Journeys same thing with laysan Albatross who travel in entire ocean on a trip sometimes up to the same Zone the tuna's use you can see why they might be caught. then there's George cylinder and are leatherback team out of Playa Grande packing leather bags that go right past where we are and Scott Benson seen that show that letter back to go from Indonesia all the way to Monterey so what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the Predators are we can actually see how they're using Eco spaces as large as an ocean and from this information we can begin to map The Hope spot all right so this is just three years of data right here and there's a decade of this data we see the pulse in the seasonal activities that these animals are going on. so what were you able to do with this information is boil it down to hot spots. 4000 deployments a huge Herculean task 2000 tags and an area shown here for the first time off the California coast that appears to be a Gathering Place. and then for sort of a Encore from these animals they're helping us they're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to 2,000 they're taking information from our planet at very critical places like Antarctica and the poles are seals from many countries being released for sampling underneath the ice sheets and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality on both pull this data when visualized is captivating to watch we still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data and then as these animals swim and give us the information that's important to climate issues we also think it's critical to get this information to the public to engage the public with this kind of data we did this for the great Turtle race brought in four million hits and now with Google's oceans we can actually put a white truck in that ocean and when we do and it's swims we see This Magnificent bathymetry that the shark nose is there. on its path is it goes from California to Hawaii but maybe Mission blue can fill in that ocean that we can't see we've got the capacity NASA has the ocean we just need to put it together so in conclusion we know where Yellowstone is for North America it's off our Coast we have the technology that shown us where it is what we need to think about perhaps for Mission blue is increasing the Bayou login capacity how is it that we can actually take this type of activity elsewhere and then finally to basically get the message home maybe use live links from animals such as blue whales and white sharks make killer apps if you will a lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge let's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone that way we do away with a few internet Miss. so we can save the bluefin tuna we can save the white shirt we have the Science and Technology hope is here yes we can we need just to apply this capacity further in the oceans thank you.oh very funny. you got me. we are Intel sponsors of tomorrow",0.6705728769302368,
37,BarrySchuler_2008P.sph.wav,of the plants themselves if you take a closer look at a root system you will find there are many many many diverse microbial colonies this is not big news to viticulturists they have been you know concerned with water and fertilization and again this is sort of my notion of shit against the wall pharmacology you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in you don't necessarily know with granularity we've seen so much change and we've given ourselves these tools now these high powered tools that are allowing us to turn the lens inward into something that is common to we all talk about terroir we worship terroir we say wow is my terroir great it's so special i've got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn't believe well you know we really we argue and debate about it we say it's climate it's soil it's this well guess what we can figure out what the heck terroir is it's in there waiting to be sequenced there are thousands of microbes there easy to sequence unlike a human they you know have a thousand two thousand genes we can figure out what they are all we have to do is go around and sample dig into the ground find those bugs sequence them correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don't like that's just a big database and then fertilize and then we understand what is terroir so some people will say oh my god are we playing god are we now if we engineer organisms are we playing god and you know people would always ask james watson he 's not always the most politically correct guy and they would say are you know are you playing god and he had the best answer i ever heard to this question i consider myself a very spiritual person and without you know the organized religion part and i will tell you i don't believe there's anything unnatural i don't believe that but we don't make anything unnatural now we can create bad impacts we can poison ourselves we can poison the earth but that's just a natural outcome of a mistake we so what's happening today is nature is presenting us with a toolbox and we find that this toolbox is very extensive there are microbes out there that actually make gasoline believe it or not there are microbes you know go back to yeast these are chemical factories the most sophisticated chemical factories are provided by nature and we all of us and that is a genome also is a set of rules nature will not allow you to we could engineer a grape plant but guess what we can't make the grape plant produce babies nature has put a set of rules out there we can work within the rules we can't break the rules we're just learning what the rules are i just ask the question if you could cure all disease if you could make disease go away because we understand how it actually works if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious healthy plants that grow in very hard to grow environments how 's your genome today have you thought about it lately heard about it at least if we could create clean and plentiful energy we right in the labs at synthetic genomics have single celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline is highly refined we could solve our energy problems we can reduce co two we could clean up our oceans we could make better wine if we could would we well you know i think the answer is very simple working with nature working with this tool set that we now understand i really don't understand so i will tell you right off of the bat you've heard of dna you probably studied a little bit in biology a genome is really a description for all of the dna that is in a living organism and one thing what's happening genes and chromosomes and when watson and crick in the fifties first decoded this beautiful double helix that we know as and how this revolution is about to change everything we know about the world life ourselves the dna molecule very long complicated molecule we then started on this journey to understand that all of the dna in your body has been around since the beginning of us of us as creatures there is a historical archive living in your genome is the history of our species and you as an individual human being where you're from going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years and that's now starting to be understood but also the genome is really the instruction manual it is the program it is the code of life it is what makes you function it is what makes every organism function dna is a very elegant molecule it's long and it's complicated really all you have to know about it is that there's four letters a t c g they represent the name of a chemical and with these four letters you can create a language a language that can describe anything and very complicated things you know they are generally put together in pairs creating a word or what we call base pairs and you would you know when you think about it and how we think about them if you saw two thousand and one a space odyssey and you heard the boom boom boom boom and you saw the monolith you know that was arthur c clarke 's representation that letters or the representation of four things makes us work and that may not sound very intuitive but let me flip over to something else you know about and that's computers look at this screen here and you know you see pictures and you see words but really all there are are ones and zeros the language of technology is binary you've probably heard that at some point in time everything that happens in digital is converted or a representation of a one and a zero so when you're listening to itunes and your favorite a lot of ways to describe mechanisms so let 's talk about what that means so if you look at a human genome they consist of three point two billion of these base pairs that's a lot and they mix up in all different fashions and that makes you a human being if you convert that to binary just to give you a little bit of sizing we're actually smaller than the program microsoft office it's not really all that much data i will also tell you we're at least as buggy this here is a bug in my genome that i have struggled with for a long long time when you get sick it is a bug in your genome in fact many many diseases we have struggled with for a long time like cancer we haven't been able to cure because we just don't understand how it works the genomic level we are starting to understand that so up to this point we tried to fix it by using what i call shit against the wall pharmacology which means we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species in this case it was picking up bones and creating a tool using it as a tool which meant that well let 's just throw chemicals at it and maybe it's going to make it work but if you really understand why does a cell go from normal cell to cancer what is the code what are the exact instructions that are making it do that then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out so for your next dinner over a great bottle of wine here 's a few factoids for you we actually have about twenty four thousand genes that do things we have about a hundred one hundred and twenty thousand others that don't appear to function every day but represent this archival history of how we used to work as a species going back tens of thousands of years you might also be interested in knowing that a mouse has about the same amount of genes they recently sequenced pinot noir and it also has about thirty thousand genes so the number of genes you have may not necessarily represent the complexity or the evolutionary order of any particular species now look around just look next to your neighbor look forward look backward we all look pretty different a lot of very handsome and pretty people here skinny chubby different races cultures we are all ninety nine point nine percent genetically equal it is one one hundredth of one percent of genetic material that makes the difference between any one of us that's a tiny amount of material but the way that ultimately expresses itself is what makes changes in humans and in all species apes just sort of running around and eating and doing each other figured out they can make things if they used a tool all the time the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human for about dollar five thousand in about an hour or a half hour you will see that happen in the next five years and what that means is you are going to walk around with your own personal genome on a smart card it will be here and when you buy medicine you won 't be buying a drug that's used for everybody you will give your genome to the pharmacist and your drug will be made for you and it will work much better than the ones that were you won 't have side effects all those side effects you know oily residue and you know whatever they in those commercials forget about that they're going to make all that stuff go away what does a genome look like well there it is it is a long long series of these base pairs if you saw the genome for a mouse of for a human it would look no different than but what scientists are doing now is they're understanding what these do and what they mean because what nature is doing is double clicking all the time and that moved us to the next level and you know we in the last thirty years in particular have seen this acceleration in knowledge and in other words the first couple of sentences here assuming this is a grape plant make a root make a branch create a blossom in a human being down in here it could be make blood cells start cancer for me it may be every calorie you consume you conserve because i come from a very cold climate for my wife eat three times as much and you never put on any weight it's all hidden in this code and it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace so what can we do with genomes now that we can read them now that we're starting to have the book of life well there's many things some are exciting some people will find very scary i will tell you a couple of things that will probably make you want to projectile puke on me but that's okay so you know we now can learn the history of organisms you can do a very simple test scrape your cheek send it off you can find out how we may be able to fix them because we can understand this we can fix them make better organisms far better and smarter than us has given us that toolbox and we now have the ability to use it you have a uti you've probably or ever had a uti you've come in contact with this little bug very simple only has about two hundred and forty six genes but we were able to completely synthesize that genome now you have the genome and you say to yourself so if i plug this synthetic genome if i pull the old one out and plug it in does it just boot up and live not only does it do that if you took the genome that synthetic genome and you plugged it into a different critter like yeast you now turn that yeast into sort of like booting up a pc with a mac os software well actually you could do it the other way so you know by being able to write a genome and plug it into an organism the software if you will changes the hardware and this is extremely profound last year the french and italians announced they got together and they went ahead and they sequenced pinot noir the genomic sequence now exists for the entire pinot noir organism they identified once again about twenty nine thousand genes they have discovered pathways that create flavors although it's very important to understand that those compounds that it's cranking out have to match a receptor in our genome in our tongue for us to understand and interpret those flavors they've also discovered that there's a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well knowing that we can read it knowing that we can write it change it maybe write its genome from scratch in your home and in not just your pc but in every device in your washing machine well one thing you could do is what some people might call franken we can build a better vine by the way just so you know you get stressed out about genetically modified organisms there is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere that is not genetically modified not grown from seeds they're grafted into root stock they would not exist in nature on their own so don't worry about don't stress about that stuff we've been doing this forever so we could you know focus on disease resistance we can go for higher yields without necessarily having dramatic farming techniques to do it or we could conceivably expand the climate window we could make pinot noir grow maybe in long island god forbid we could produce better flavors and aromas you want a little more raspberry a little more chocolate here or there all of these things could conceivably be done and i will tell you i 'd pretty much bet that it will be done but there's an ecosystem here in other words we're not sort of unique little organisms running around we are part of a big your cellphone you're walking around your car has twelve microprocessors then we go along and create the internet and connect the world together we flatten the world i'm sorry to inform you that inside of your digestive tract is about ten pounds of microbes which you're circulating through your body quite a bit our ocean 's teaming with microbes in fact when craig venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet by discovering all new microbes in the first twenty feet of water we now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate and regulating co two and oxygen than plants do which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere we find microbial life in every part of the planet in ice in coal in rocks in,1,"what's happening in genomics and how this revolution is about to change everything we know about the world life ourselves and how we how we think about them if you saw 2001 A Space Odyssey in your heard the boom boom boom boom and you saw the monolith representation that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species in this case it was picking up phones and creating a tool using it as a tool which meant that just sort of running around and eating and doing each other figured out they can make things if they used a tool and that moved us to a Next Level and you know when the last 30 years in particular have seen this acceleration and knowledge and technology and technology has bred more knowledge and given us the tools and we've seen many salmon. moments we've seen the creation of small computers in the seventies and early eighties and who would have thought back then that every single person would not just have one computer but probably 20 in your home in your hand and not just your PC but in everyone every device in your washing machine your cell phone you're walking around your car has 12 microprocessors then we go along and create the internet and connect the world together we flattened the world we've seen so much change and we've given ourselves of these tools now these high power tools that are allowing us to turn the lens inward into something that is common to all of us and that is a Geno. how's your genome today have you thought about it lately heard about it at least probably hear about genomes these days I thought I'd take a moment to tell you what a genome is it sort of like if you ask people what what is a MB or MB and what is broadband people never want to say I really don't understand so I will tell you right off the bat you've heard of DNA probably a little bit and biology genome is really a description for all of the DNA that is in a living organism and one thing that is common to all of life is DNA doesn't matter whether your yeast doesn't matter whether you're Emmaus doesn't matter whether you're a fly we all have DNA the DNA is organized in words call them genes and chromosomes and when Watson and Crick in the 50s first Dakota this beautiful double helix that. I know as the DNA molecule very long complicated molecule we then started on this journey to understand that inside of that DNA is a language that determines the characteristics are traits what we inherit what diseases we may get we've also along the way I'm discovered that this is a very old molecule that all of the DNA in your body has been around forever since the beginning of us of us as creatures there is a historical archive living in your genome is the history of our species and you as an individual human being where you're where you're from I'm going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years and that's now starting to be understood but also the genome is really the instruction manual it is the program. it is the code of life it is what makes you function it is what makes every organism function DNA is a very elegant molecule it's long and it's complicated really all you have to know about it is that there's four letters a TCG that represent the name of the

heard that at some point in time everything that happens in digital is converted or a representation of a one and a zero so when you're listening to iTunes and your favorite music that's really just a bunch of ones and zeros playing very quickly when you're seeing these pictures it's all ones and zeros when you're talking on your telephone your cell phone and it's going over to the network your voice is all being turned into ones and zeros and magically whizzed around and look at all the complexities things and wonderful things we've been able to create with just the one in 20 will now you rent that up to 4 and you have a lot of complexity. a lot of ways to describe mechanisms to let's talk about what that means so if you look at a human genome consists of 3.2 billion of these days pairs that slot and they mix up and all different Fashions than that makes you a human being if you convert that to Binary just to give you a little bit of sizing we're actually smaller than the program Microsoft Office it's not really all that much data is a bug in my jeans that I have struggled with for a long long time when you get sick it is a bug in your genome in fact many many diseases we have struggled with for for a long time like answer we haven't been able. to cure because we just don't understand how it works at the genomic level we are starting to understand that so up to this

to function everyday but represent this archival history of how we used to work as a species going back tens of thousands of years you might also be interested. knowing that a mouse has about the same amount of jeans they recently sequence Pinot Noir and it also has about 30,000 jeans jeans you have may not necessarily represent the complexity or The evolutionary order of any particular species that look around just look next to your neighbor look forward to look backward we all look pretty different spot a very handsome pretty people here skinny chubby different races cultures we are all 99.9% equal one one-hundredth of 1% of genetic material that makes the difference between any one of us that's a tiny amount of material but the way that ultimately expresses itself is what makes changes in humans and in all species so we are now able to read Gino's the first human genome took ten years three. billion dollars stunned by a doctor Craig Venter and then James Watson one of the co-founders of DNA genome was done for two million dollars and in just two months and if you think about the computer industry and how we found from Big computers two little ones and how they get more powerful and faster all the time the same thing is happening with Gene sequencing that we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes for about $5,000 in about an hour or half-hour you will see that happen the next five years and what that means is you are going to walk around with your own personal genome on a smart card. they will be here and when you buy medicine you won't be buying a drug that's used for everybody you will give your genome to the pharmacist and your drug will be made for you and it will work much better than the ones that work he won't have side effects of all those side effects you know oily residue and whatever they say. Go away what is a genome look like. well there it is it is a long long series of these base pairs if you saw the genome for a Mauser for human it would look no different than this but what scientists are doing now is their understanding what these do and what they mean because what nature is doing is double-clicking all the time and other words the first couple of sentences here assuming this is a grape plant make a root make a branch create a blossom any human being down in here it could be make blood cells start cancer for me and maybe every calorie you consume you can serve because I come from a very called climate for my wife eat three times as much and you never put on anyway it's all hidden in this code and it's starting to be understood at Breakneck pace. so what can we do with genotypes now that we can read them now that we are starting to have the Book of Life well there's many things some are exciting some people will find very scary I will tell you a couple things that will probably make you want to projectile puke on me but that's okay so you know we now can learn the history of organ organisms you can do a very simple test scrape your cheek send it off you can find out where your relatives come from you can do your genealogy going back thousands of years we can understand functionality this is really important we can understand for example are arteries what creates the starchiness inside of a grain why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide we can also look at a grander scale what creates problems what creates disease and how we may be able to fix them because we can understand this we can fix them make better. organisms most importantly what we're learning is that nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox the toolbox exists an architect far better better and smarter than us has given us that tool box and we now have the ability to use it we are now not just reading genomes we are riding them this company synthetic genomics I'm involved with created the first full synthetic genome for little bug a very primitive creature called mycoplasma genitalium if you have a UTI you've probably or had ever had a UTI you you come in contact with this little bug very simple only has about 246 jeans but we were able to completely synthesize that genome. now you have the genome and you say to yourself so if I plug the Simpson that Aquino if I pull the old one out and plug it in does it just boot up and live well guess what it does. not only does it to that if you took the genome that synthetic genome and you plugged it into a different Critter like yeast you now turn that East into mycoplasma it's sort of like booting up a PC with a Mac OS software will actually the genome and plug it into an organism the software if you will changes the hardware and this is extremely profound so last year the French and Italians announce they got together and they went ahead and made sequence Pinot Noir genome sequence now exist for the entire Pinot Noir organism they identified once again about 29,000 jeans they have discovered Pathways that create flavors although it's very important to understand that those compounds that it's cranking out. the match a receptor in our genome in our time for us to understand and interpret those flavors they've also discovered that there is a heck of a lot of activity going on producing a Roma as well they've identified areas of vulnerability to disease they now or understanding and the work is going on exactly how this plant works and we have the capability to know to read that entire code and understand how it ticks so then what are you do knowing we can read it knowing that we can write it change it may be right its genome from scratch so what are you do well one thing you could do is what some people might call Frank and wire. we can build a better Vine by the way just so you know you get stressed out about genetically modified organism there is not one single Vine in this Valley or anywhere that is not genetically modified they're not grown from seeds that are grafted into rootstock they would not exist in nature on their own so don't worry about don't stress about that stuff we've been doing this forever so we could focus on disease resistance we can go for higher yields without necessarily having dramatic farming techniques to do it or cost we could conceivably expand the climate window we can make a Pinot Noir grow may be in Long Island God forbid. we could produce better flavor flavors and Aromas he want a little more raspberry a little more chocolate here are there all of these things could conceivably be done and I will tell you I'd pretty much bet that it will be done but there's an echo system here in other words we're not sort of unique little organisms running around we are part of a big ecosystem in fact I'm sorry to inform you that inside of your digestive tract is about 10 lb of microbe with your circulating through your body quite a bit our oceans teaming with microbes in fact when Craig Venter went and sequins tie the microbes in the ocean in the first three months triple the known species on the planet by discovering all new microbes in the first 20 ft of water We Now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate and regulating CO2 and oxygen in plants do which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere we find microbial life in every part of the. planet and ice and cold and in rocks and in volcanic vents it's an amazing thing but we've also discovered when it comes to plant in Plants as much as we understand and are starting to understand their genomes it is the echo system around them it is a microbes that live in their root systems that have just as much impact on the character of those plants as the metabolic pathways of the plants themselves if you take a closer look at a roof system you will find there are many many many diverse microbial colonies this is not big news to viticulturist they have been you know concerned with water and fertilization and again this is sort of my notion of shit against the wall of pharmacology you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in you don't necessarily know at with brand new larity exactly what. innocence are providing what flavors and what characteristics we can start to figure that out we all talked about terroir we worship terroir we say it's so special I've got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn't believe what we really we argue and we can figure out what the heck terroir is it's in there waiting to be sequenced there are thousands of microbes there they're easy to sequence and like a human they are you know have a thousand two thousand genes we can figure out what they aren't all we have to do is go around and Sample dig dig into the ground find those bugs sequence them correlate them to do the kinds of characteristics we like and don't like that's just a big database and then fertilize and then we understand what is terroir so some people will say oh my God are we playing God are we. now if we engineer organisms are we playing God and you know people would always ask James Watson it's not always the most politically correct guy you know are you playing God and he had the best answer I ever heard to this question will somebody has to. I consider myself a very spiritual person and without you know the organized religion partner and I will tell you I don't believe there's anything unnatural I don't believe that chemicals are unnatural I told you how to make some of your puke it's very simple we don't invent molecules compounds they're here they're in the universe we reorganize things we change them around but we don't make anything unnatural when that we can create that impacts we can poison ourselves we can poison the Earth but that's just a natural outcome of a mistake we met so what's happening today is nature is presenting us with a toolbox and we find that this tool box is very extensive there are microbes out there that actually make gasoline Believe It or Not There are microbes you know go back to East these are chemical factories the most sophisticated chemical factories are provided by nature and we now can use those. there also is a set of rules nature will not allow you to we can engineer a grape plant but guess what we can't make the grape plant produce babies Nature has put a set of rules out there we can work within the rules We Can't Break The Rules we're just learning what the rules are I just asked the question if you could cure all disease if you could make disease go away because we understand how it actually works if we could end Hunger by being able to create nutritious healthy plants that grow in in very hard to grow environments if we could create clean and plentiful energy we were right in the labs at synthetic genomics have single-celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide. and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline so carbon dioxide the stuff we want to get rid of not sugar or not anything carbon dioxide little bit of sunlight do you end up with a lipid that is highly refined we could solve our energy problems we can reduce CO2 we could clean up our oceans we can make better wine if we could would we well you know I think the answer is very simple working with nature working with this tool set that we Now understand is the next step in humankind's evolution and all I can tell you is stay healthy for 20 years if you can stay healthy for 20 years you'll see 150 maybe three hundred thank you",0.7486978769302368,
38,BarrySchwartz_2009.sph.wav,are behind you this will fail and there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you because different people in different communities organize their lives in different ways so there's a lot here at ted and at other places to celebrate and you don't have to be a mega hero there are ordinary heroes ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too as practitioners each and everyone of us should strive to be ordinary if not extraordinary heroes as heads of organizations we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will even the wisest and most well meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work if you run an organization you should be sure that none of the jobs none of the jobs have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors because the truth is that any work that you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work and any moral work depends upon practical wisdom and perhaps most important as teachers we should strive to be the ordinary heroes the moral exemplars to the people we mentor the janitor 's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital and yet and there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers one is that we are always teaching someone is always watching the camera is always on bill gates talked about the importance of education and in particular the model that kipp was providing knowledge is power and he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that kipp is doing to take inner city kids and turn them in the direction of college i want to focus on one particular thing kipp is doing that bill didn't mention that is that they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character they need to learn to respect themselves they need to learn to respect their schoolmates they need to learn to respect their teachers and most important they need to learn to respect learning that's the principle objective if you do that the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill and the teachers the way you teach these things to the kids is by having the teachers and all the other staff when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like they encountered mike other virtues honesty kindness courage and so on to be displayed at the right time and in the right way he also appealed to hope right again think there is reason for hope i think people want to be allowed to be virtuous in many ways it's what ted is all about wanting to do the right thing in the right way for the right reasons this kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention paying attention to what we do to how we do it and perhaps most importantly to the structure of the organizations in which we work so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than having it suppressed thank you very much thank you who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because mister jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise trying to build up his strength walking slowly up and down the hall you and charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor 's admonition and didn't vacuum the visitor 's lounge because there were some family members who were there all day every day who at this moment happened to be taking a nap his inaugural address barack obama appealed and then there was luke who washed the floor in a comatose young man 's room twice and behavior like this from janitors from technicians from nurses and if we're lucky now and then from doctors each of us to give our best doesn't just make people feel a little better it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well now not all janitors are like this of course but the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness care and empathy are an essential part of the job as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis but what did he appeal to he did not happily follow in the footsteps of his predecessor and tell us to just go shopping and yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings these janitors have the moral will to do right by other people and beyond this they have the moral skill to figure out what doing right means practical wisdom aristotle told us is the combination of moral will and moral skill a wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives a wise person knows how to improvise as luke did when he re washed the floor real world problems are often ambiguous and ill defined and the context is always changing a wise person is like a jazz musician using the notes on the page but dancing around them inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand a wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims to serve other people not to manipulate other people and finally perhaps most important a wise person is made not born wisdom depends on experience and not just any experience you need the time to get to know the people that you're serving you need permission to be allowed to improvise try new things occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures and you need to be mentored by wise teachers when you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones i described how hard it is to learn to do their job they tell you that it takes lots of experience and they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans it takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people at ted brilliance is rampant it's scary the good news is you don't need to be brilliant to be wise the bad news is that without wisdom now i hope that we all know this there's a sense in which it's obvious and yet let me tell you a little story it's a story about lemonade nor did he tell us trust us trust your country invest invest invest instead what he told us was to put aside childish things a dad and his seven year old son were watching a detroit tigers game at the ballpark his son asked him for some lemonade and dad went to the concession stand to buy it all they had was mike 's hard lemonade which was five percent alcohol dad being an academic had no idea that mike 's hard lemonade and they were ready to let the kid go but not so fast the wayne county child welfare protection agency said no and the child was sent to a foster home for three days at that point can the child go home well a judge said yes but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel after two weeks i'm happy to report the family was reunited but the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing we hate to do it but we have to follow procedure how do things like this scott simon who told this story on npr said rules and procedures may be dumb but they spare you from thinking and to be fair rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lax and they let a child go back to an abusive household fair enough when things go wrong as of course they do we reach for two tools to try to fix them one tool we reach for is rules better ones more of them the second tool we reach for is incentives better ones more of them what else after all is there we can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis regulate regulate regulate fix the incentives fix the incentives fix the incentives the truth is and he appealed to virtue virtue is an old fashioned word it seems a little out of place that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job how could you even write a rule that go the janitors to do what they did and would you pay them a bonus for being it's preposterous on its face and what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules rules and incentives may make things better in the short run but they create a downward spiral moral skill is chipped away by an over reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisations and moral will is undermined by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing second no doubt more familiar to you is the nature of modern american education scripted lock step curricula here 's an example from chicago kindergarten reading and enjoying literature and words that begin with b the bath assemble students on a rug and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water say in a cutting edge environment like this one and besides some of you might be wondering what the hell does it mean let me begin with an example seventy five items in this script to teach a twenty five page picture book all over chicago in every kindergarten class in the city every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day we know why these scripts are there we don't trust the judgment of teachers enough to let them loose on their own don't get me wrong we need rules jazz musicians need some notes most of them need some notes on the page we need more rules for the bankers god knows but too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising and as a result they lose their gifts or worse they stop playing altogether now how about incentives they seem cleverer if you have one reason for doing something and i give you a second reason for doing the same thing it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you're more likely to do it right well not always sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complimenting and they make people less likely to do it i'll just give you one example because time is racing in switzerland back about fifteen years ago they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps there was going to be a national referendum they knew it was dangerous they thought it would reduce their property values but it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens the psychologists asked other people a slightly different question they said if we paid you six weeks salary this is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up on the screen and all of the every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community two reasons it's my responsibility and i'm getting paid instead of fifty percent saying yes twenty five percent said yes what happens is that the second this introduction of incentive gets us so that instead of asking what is my responsibility all we ask is what serves my interests when incentives don't work when ceos ignore the long term health of their companies in pursuit of short term gains that will lead to massive bonuses the response is always the same get smarter incentives the truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough any incentive system can be subverted by bad will we need incentives people have to make a living but excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word it causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality barack obama said before he was inaugurated we must ask not just is it profitable but is it right items on it are unremarkable they're the things you would expect mop the floors sweep them empty the trash restock the cabinets it may be a little surprising and we certainly see it in the world of business it is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work so what can we do a few sources of hope we ought to try to re moralize work one way not to do it teach more ethics courses there is no better way to show people that you're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course what to do instead one celebrate moral exemplars acknowledge when you go to law school that a little how many things there are but it's not surprising what they are but the one thing i want you to notice about them is don't know how many of you remember this another moral hero fifteen years ago aaron feuerstein who was the head of malden mills in massachussetts they made polartec the factory burned down three thousand employees he kept go maybe on paper our company is worth less to wall street but i can tell you it's worth more we're doing fine just at this ted we heard talks from several moral heroes two were particularly inspiring to me one was ray anderson who turned turned you know a part of the evil empire into a zero footprint or almost zero footprint business why because it was the right thing to do and a bonus he 's discovering is he 's actually going to make even more money his employees are inspired by the effort why because there happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do yesterday we heard willie smits talk about even though this is a very long list there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings not one but most important to make it work and he emphasized this is that it took knowing the people in the communities unless the people you're working with,1,"in his inaugural address Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best as we try to extricate ourselves from this Current financial crisis but why did he appeal to he did not happily follow in the footsteps of his predecessor and tell us to just go shopping. nor did he tell us trust us trust your country invest Investments invest instead what he told us was to put aside childish things and he appealed to virtue. virtue is an old-fashioned word it seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one and besides some of you might be wondering what the hell does it mean let me begin with an example. these are this is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up on the screen and all of the items on it are unremarkable they're the things you would expect mop the floors sweep them empty the trash is restock the cabinets it may be a little surprising how many things there are but it's not surprising what they are but the one thing I want you to notice about them is this. even though this is a very long list there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings not one. the janitor's job could just as well be done in a mortuary is in a hospital and yet when some psychologists interviewed Hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like they encountered Mike who told him about how he stopped

didn't vacuum the visitors Lounge because there were some family members who were there all day everyday who at this moment happened to be taking a nap and then there was Luke who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice. because the Man's father who had been keeping a vigil for 6 months didn't see Luke do it the first time and his father was angry. and behavior like this from janitors from technicians from nurses and if we're lucky every now and then from doctors doesn't just make people feel a little better it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well not all janitors are like this of course but the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness care and empathy are an essential part of the job and yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings these janitors have the moral will to do right by other people and be honest they have the moral skill to figure out what

that it takes lots of experience and they don't mean to takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans it takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people. at Ted Brilliance is rampant is scary the good news is that you don't need to be brilliant to be wise. the bad news is that without wisdom Brilliance isn't enough it's as likely to get you into trouble and other people into trouble as anything else. now I hope that we all know this there's a sense in which it's obvious and yet let me tell you a little story it's a story about lemonade a dad and his eleven-year-old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the Ballpark his son asked him for some lemonade and dad went to the concession stand to buy it all they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade which was 5% alcohol dad being an academic had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade contain alcohol so we brought it back and the kid was drinking it and a security guard spotted it and called the police who called an ambulance the rush to the ballpark with the kids to the hospital the emergency room to ascertain that the kids had no alcohol in his blood and they were ready to let the kid go but not so fast the Wayne County Child Welfare protective agency said no. and the child was sent to a foster home for three days. at that point can the child go home well the judge said yes but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel. after two weeks I'm happy to report the family was reunited but the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge also said the same thing we hate to do it but we have to follow procedure. how to say things like this happen Scott Simon who told the story on NPR said rules and procedures may be dumb but they spare you from thinking and to be fair and to be fair rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lacks and they let a child go back to an abusive household fair enough when things go wrong as of course they do we reach for two tools to try to fix them one tool we reach for is rules better ones more of them the second tool reach for his incentives better ones more of them what else after all is there. we can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis regulate regulate regulate fix the incentives fix the incentives fix the incentives the truth is that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job how could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did and would you pay them a bonus for being empathic is preposterous on its face. and what happens is that as we turned increasingly the rules rules and incentives may make things better in the short run but they create a downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run moral skill is chipped Away by an over-reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisation and our will is undermined by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing and without intending it by appealing to rules and incentives we are engaging in a war on wisdom let me just give you a few example first of rules and the war on Morrell still the lemonade story is one second no doubt more familiar to you is the nature of modern American Education scripted lockstep curriculum here's an example from Chicago kindergarten. reading and enjoying literature in words that begin with B the bath assemble students on a rug give students a warning about the dangers of hot water say 75 items in this spring to teach a 25-page picture book all over Chicago and every kindergarten class in the city every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day. we know why these scripts are there we don't trust the Judgment of teachers enough to let them loose on their own scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster. and they prevent disaster but what they are sure and its place is mediocrity. don't get me wrong we need rules Jazz musicians need some notes most of them need some notes on the page we need more rules for the bankers God knows but too many rules prevent accomplished Jazz musicians from improvising and as a result they lose their gifts or worse they stop playing all together now how about incentives they seem clever if you have one reason for doing something and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you're more likely to do it right well not always sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complimenting and they make people less likely to do it I'll just give you one example because time is racing in Switzerland back in about 15 years ago they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps it was going to be a national referendum and some psychologist. around and pole citizens were very well-informed and they said would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community astonishingly 50% of the citizens said yes they knew or thought it was dangerous they thought it would reduce their property values but it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as Citizens. the psychologist asked other people a slightly different question they said if we paid you six weeks salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community to reasons it's my responsibility and I'm getting paid instead of 50% saying yes 25% said yes. what happens is that the second this the introduction of the incentive get so so that instead of asking what is my responsibility all we ask is what serves my interests when incentives don't work when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses the response is always the same get smarter in sentence. the truth is that there are no incentives you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough any incentive system can be subverted by bad will. we need incentives people have to make a living but excessive Reliance on incentive demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word it causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality. Barack Obama said before he was inaugurated we must ask not just isn't profitable but is it right and when professions are demoralized everyone in them becomes dependent on addicted to incentives and they stop asking is it right we see this in Madison. and we certainly see it in the world of business. it is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work so what can we do a few sources of Hope We ought to try to re Mara lies work one way not to do it. teachmore ethics courses. there is no better way to show people that you're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course what to do instead one celebrate Morrow exemplars. acknowledge when you go to law school that a little voice is whispering in your ear about Atticus Finch no ten-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and Acquisitions people are inspired by moral Heroes but we learn that with sophistication comes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have more knowledge them be proud that you have them celebrate them and demand that the people who teach you acknowledge and celebrate them to that's one thing we can do. I don't know how many of you remember this another Marvel hero 15 years ago are enforced Tina was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts they made polartec the factory burned down 3,000 employees he kept every one of them on the payroll. why because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them go maybe on paper our company's worthless to Wall Street but I can tell you it's worth more we're doing fine just at this Ted we heard talks from Chevrolet Marvel Heroes 2 and particularly inspiring to me when was raeanne.. who turned you know. turn do you know a part of the evil empire into a zero footprint or almost a zero footprint business why because it was the right thing to do and a bonus he's discovering is he's actually going to make even more money his employees are inspired by the effort why because they're happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do yesterday we heard Willie Smith talk about reforesting in Indonesia. in many ways this is a perfect example because it took the will to do the right thing and God knows it took a huge amount of technical skill boggled and how much he needed to know in order and his associates in order to plot this out but most important to make it work and he emphasized this is that it took knowing the people in the communities unless the people you're working with our support or behind you this will fail and there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you because different people in different communities to organize their lives in different ways so there is a lot here at Ed and in other places to celebrate and you don't have to be a mega hero there are ordinary Heroes ordinary Heroes like the janitor who are worth celebrating too ordinary if not extraordinary Heroes. instead encourage and nurture both moral skill and Mara will even the wisest and most well-meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work if you run an organization you should be sure that none of the jobs none of the jobs have job descriptions like the job description of the janitors because the truth is that any work you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work and any moral work depends upon practical wisdom and perhaps most important as teachers We should strive to be the ordinary Heroes tomorrow exemplars to the people we mentor and there are a few things that we have to remember his teachers one is that we are always teaching someone is always watching the camera is always on Bill Gates talked. about the importance of education and in particular the model that kyp was providing knowledge is power and he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that kid is doing to take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college I want to focus on one particular thing kept his doing that bill didn't mention and that is they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character they need to learn to respect themselves they need to learn to respect their schoolmates they need to learn to respect their teachers and most important they need to learn to respect learning. that's the principal objective if you do that the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill and the teachers the way you teach these things to kids is by having the teacher and all the other staff and body it every minute of every day Obama appeal to Virtue and I think he was right and the virtue that we need above all others I think it's practical wisdom cuz it's what allows other virtues honesty kindness courage and so on to be displayed at the right time and in the right way he also appealed to Hope right again I think there is Reason for Hope I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous in many ways it's what 10 is all about wanting to do the right thing in the white right way for the right reasons this kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and everyone of us. if only we start paying attention paying attention to what we do to how we do it and perhaps most importantly to the structure of the organization within which we work so as to make sure that it enables Us and other people to develop wisdom weather that rather than having it suppressed thank you very much. thank you. thank you very much",0.74609375,
39,BarrySchwartz_2010S.sph.wav,he was married he had a third kid on the way he suffered from ptsd in addition to the bad and recurrent nightmares and he had started using marijuana to ease some of the symptoms he was only able to get part time work because of his back and so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table and take care of his family so he started selling marijuana he was busted in a drug sweep his family was kicked out of their apartment and the welfare system was threatening to take away his kids under normal sentencing procedures judge russell would have had little choice but to sentence pettengill to serious jail time as a drug but judge russell did have an alternative and that's because he was in a special court he was in a court called the veterans court in the veterans court this was the first of its kind in the united states judge russell created the veterans court it was a court only for veterans who had broken the law and he had created it exactly because mandatory sentencing laws were taking the judgment out of no one wanted non violent offenders and especially non violent offenders who were veterans to boot to be thrown into prison they wanted to do something about what we all know namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system and what the veterans court did was it treated each criminal as an individual tried to get inside their problems to fashion responses to their crimes that helped them to rehabilitate themselves and didn't forget about them once the judgment was made stayed with them followed up on them made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan had been jointly developed to get them over the hump there are now twenty two cities that have veterans courts like this why has the idea well one reason is that judge russell has now seen one hundred and eight vets in his veterans court if things aren't going right the first response is let 's make more rules as of february of this year and out of one hundred and eight guess how many have gone back through the revolving door of justice into prison none anyone would glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record so here 's is a system and it seems to be catching there's a banker who created a for profit community bank that encouraged bankers i know this is hard to believe encouraged bankers who worked there to do well by doing good for their low income clients the bank helped finance the rebuilding of what was otherwise a dying community though their loan recipients were high risk by ordinary standards the default rate was extremely low the bank was profitable the bankers stayed with their loan recipients they didn't make loans and then sell the loans they serviced the loans they made sure that their loan recipients were staying up with their payments banking hasn't always been the way we read about it now in the newspapers let 's set up a set of detailed procedures to make sure that people will do the right thing give teachers scripts even goldman sachs once used to serve clients before it turned into an institution that serves only itself banking wasn't always this way and it doesn't have to be this way so there are examples like this in medicine doctors at harvard who are trying to transform medical education so that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion and loss of empathy which characterizes most medical students in the course of their medical training and the way they do it is to give third year medical students patients who they follow for an entire year so the patients are not organ systems and they're not diseases they're people people with lives and in order to be an effective doctor you need to treat people who have lives and not just disease in addition to which there's an enormous amount of back and forth mentoring of one student by another of all the students by the doctors and the result is a generation we hope of doctors who do have time for the people they treat we'll see so there are lots of examples like this that we talk about each of them shows that it is possible to build on and nurture character and keep a profession true to its proper mission what aristotle would have called its and ken and i believe that this is what practitioners actually want people want to be allowed to be virtuous to follow in the classroom so even if they don't know what they're doing and don't care about the welfare of our kids as long as they follow the scripts our kids will get educated they want to have permission to do the right thing they don't want to feel like they need to take a shower to get the moral grime off their bodies everyday when they come home from work aristotle thought that practical wisdom was the key to happiness and he was right there's now a lot of research being done in psychology on what makes people happy and the two things that jump out in study after study i know this will come as a shock to all of you the two things that matter most to happiness are love and work rules and incentives don't tell you how to be a good friend how to be a good parent how to be a good spouse or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher rules and incentives are no substitutes for wisdom indeed we argue there is no substitute for wisdom and so practical wisdom does not require heroic acts of self sacrifice on the part of practitioners in giving us the will in fees more and more rules to protect us against an indifferent uncaring set of institutions we have to deal with or or maybe and in addition to rules let 's see if we can come up with some really clever incentives so that even if the people we deal with don't particularly want to serve our interests it is in their interest to serve our the magic incentives that will get people to do the right thing even out of pure selfishness so we offer teachers bonuses if the kids they teach score passing grades on these big test scores that are used to evaluate the quality of school systems rules and incentives sticks and carrots we passed a bunch of rules to regulate the financial industry in response to the recent collapse there's the dodd frank act there's the new consumer financial protection agency that is temporarily being headed through the backdoor by elizabeth warren maybe these rules will actually improve the way these financial services companies behave we'll see in addition we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them more interested in serving the long term interests even of their own companies rather than securing short term profits so if we find just the right incentives they'll do the right thing as i said selfishly and if we come up with the right rules and regulations they won 't drive us all over a cliff and ken and i certainly know that you need to reign in the bankers if there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse it is that but what we believe and what we argue in the book is that there is no set of rules no matter how detailed no matter how specific no matter how carefully monitored and enforced there is no set of rules that will get us what we need why because bankers are smart people and like water they will find cracks in any set of rules you design a set of rules that will make sure that the particular reason why the financial system almost collapsed again it is naive beyond description to think that having blocked this source of financial collapse you have blocked all possible so there is among many people certainly me and most of the people i talk to a kind of collective dissatisfaction with the way things are working with the way our institutions sources of financial collapse so it's just a question of waiting for the next one and then marveling at how we could have been so stupid as not to protect ourselves against that what we desperately need beyond or along with better rules and reasonably smart incentives is we need virtue we need character we need people who want to do the right thing and in particular the virtue that we need most of all is the virtue that aristotle called practical wisdom practical wisdom is the moral will to do the right thing and the moral skill to figure out what the right thing is so aristotle was very in watching how the craftsmen around him worked and he was impressed at how they would improvise novel solutions to novel problems problems that they hadn't anticipated so one example is he sees these stonemasons working on the isle of lesbos and they need to measure out round columns well if you think about it it's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler so what do they do they fashion a novel solution to the problem they created a ruler that bends what we would call these days a tape measure a flexible rule a rule that bends and aristotle said hah they appreciated that sometimes to design rounded columns you need to bend the dealing with other people demands a kind of flexibility that no set of rules can encompass wise people know when and how to bend the rules wise people know how to improvise the way my co author ken and i talk about it they are kind of like jazz musicians the rules are like the notes on the page our kids teachers seem to be failing them you started but then you dance around the notes on the page coming up with just the right combination for this particular moment with this particular set of fellow players so for aristotle the kind of rule bending rule exception finding and improvisation that you see in skilled craftsmen is exactly what you need to be a skilled moral craftsman and in interactions with people almost all the time it is this kind of our doctors don't know who the hell we are and they don't have enough time for us we certainly can't trust the bankers if you are a rule bender and an improviser mostly to serve yourself what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people so it matters that you do this wise practice in the service of others and not in the service of yourself and so the will to do the right thing is just as important as the moral skill of improvisation and exception finding together they comprise practical wisdom which aristotle thought was the master virtue so i'll give you an example of wise practice in action it's the case of michael he had a pretty low wage job he was supporting his wife and a child and the child was going to parochial school then he lost his job he panicked about being able to support his family one night he drank a little too much and he robbed a cab driver and we certainly can't trust the brokers they almost brought the entire financial system down and even as we do our stole dollar fifty he robbed him at gunpoint it was a toy gun he got he had never committed a crime before he was a responsible husband and father he had been faced with desperate circumstances all this would do is wreck a family and so she improvised a sentence eleven months and not only that but release every day to go to work it turned out the prosecutor was not happy that judge forer ignored the sentencing guidelines and sort of invented her own and so he appealed and he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery all too often we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing and doing the expected thing or the required thing or the profitable he did after all have a toy gun the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery is five years had to follow the law and by the way this appeal went through after he had finished serving his sentence so he was out and working and michael disappeared so that is an example both of wisdom in practice and the subversion of wisdom by rules that are meant of course to make things better now consider miss dewey miss dewey 's a teacher in a texas elementary school she found herself listening to a consultant one day who was trying to help teachers boost the test scores of the kids so that the school would reach the elite category in percentage of kids passing big tests all these schools in texas compete with one another to achieve these milestones and there are bonuses and various other treats that come if you beat the other schools don't waste your time on kids who can't pass the test no matter what you do third don't waste your time on kids who moved into the district too late for their scores to be counted focus all of your time and attention on the kids who are on the bubble the so called bubble kids kids where your intervention can get them just maybe over the line from failing to passing so miss dewey heard this and she shook her head in despair while fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on and nodding approvingly it's like they were about to go play a football game for miss dewey this isn't why she became a teacher thing so everywhere we look pretty much across the board we worry that the people we depend on don't really have our interests at heart now ken and i are not naive and we understand that you need to have rules you need to have incentives people have to make a living but the problem with relying on rules and incentives is that they demoralize professional activity and they demoralize professional activity in two senses first they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity judge forer quits and miss dewey in completely disheartened and second they demoralize the activity itself the very practice is demoralized and the practitioners are demoralized it creates people when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing it creates people who are addicted to incentives that is to say it creates people who only do things for incentives now the striking thing about this is that psychologists have known this for thirty years psychologists have known about negative consequences of incentivizing everything for thirty years we know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures they stop caring about the drawing and care only about the reward if you reward kids for reading books they stop caring about what's in the books and only care about how long they are if you reward teachers for kids test scores they stop caring about educating and only care about test preparation if you were to reward doctors for doing more procedures which is the current system they would do more if instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures they will do fewer what we want of course is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures and do the right amount for the right reason namely to serve the welfare of their patients psychologists have known this for decades and it's time for policymakers to start or if they do have our interests at heart we worry that they don't know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to paying attention and listen to psychologists a little bit instead of economists and it doesn't have to be this way we think ken and i that there are real sources of hope we identify one set of people in all of these practices who we call canny outlaws these are people who being forced to operate in a system that demands rule following and creates incentives find away around the rules find a way to subvert the rules so there are teachers who have these scripts to follow and they know that if they follow these scripts the kids will learn nothing and so what they do is they follow the scripts but they follow the scripts at double time and squirrel away little bits of extra time during which they teach in the way that they actually know is so these are little ordinary everyday heroes and they're incredibly admirable but there's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity in the face of a system that either roots them out or grinds them down so canny outlaws are better than nothing but it's hard to imagine any canny outlaw sustaining that for an indefinite period of time more hopeful and we talk about several one in particular is a judge named robert russell and one day he was faced with the case of gary pettengill pettengill was a twenty three year old vet,1,the first thing I want to do is say thank you to all of you the second thing I want to do is introduce my co-author and dear friend and co-teacher Ken and I have been working together for almost 40 years but can sharp over there. so there is among many people certainly me and most of the people I talked to a kind of collective dissatisfaction with the way things are working with the way our institutions run our kids teachers seem to be failing them our doctors don't know who the hell we are and they don't have enough time for us we certainly can't trust the bankers and we certainly can't trust the Brokers they almost brought the entire Financial system down and even as we do our own work all too often we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing and doing the expected thing or the required thing or the profitable thing so everywhere we look pretty much across-the-board we worried that the people we depend on don't really have our interests at heart. or if they do have our interests at heart we worried that they don't know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to to secure those interests they don't understand us they don't have the time to get to know us there are two kinds of responses that we make to this sort of General dissatisfaction if things aren't going right the first response is let's make more rules let's set up a set of detailed procedures to make sure that people will do the right thing give teachers scripts to follow in the classroom so that even if they don't know what they're doing I don't care about the welfare of our kids as long as they follow the script our kids will get educated give judges a list of mandatory sentences to impose for crimes so that you don't need to rely on judges. using their judgment instead all they have to do is look up on the list what kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime impose limits on what credit card companies can charge and interest and on what they can charge in fees more and more rules to protect us against an indifferent uncaring set of Institutions we have to deal or or maybe and in addition to rules let's see if we can come up with some really clever incentives so that even if the people we deal with don't particularly want to serve our interest it is in their interest to serve our the magic incentives that will get people to do the right thing even out of pure selfishness so we offer teachers bonuses if the kids they teach score passing grades on these big test scores that are used to evaluate the quality of school system. rules and incentives sticks and carrots we passed a bunch of rules to regulate the financial industry in response to the recent collapse there's the Dodd-Frank Act there's the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency that is temporarily being headed through the back door by Elizabeth Warren maybe these rules will actually improve the way these financial services companies behave we'll see in addition we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them more interested in serving the long-term interests even of their own companies rather than securing short-term profits so if we find just the right incentives they'll do the right thing as I said selfishly and if we come up with the right rules and regulations they won't drive us all over a cliff. and Ken and I certainly know. that you need to rein in the bankers if there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse it is that but what we believe and what we argue in the book is that there is no set of rules no matter how to tell no matter how specific no matter how carefully monitored and enforced there is no set of rules that will get us what we need why because Bankers are smart people. and like water they will find cracks in any set of rules you design a set of rules that will make sure that the particular reason why the financial system almost collapsed can't happen again it is naive Beyond description to think that having blocked this source of financial collapse you have blocked all possible sources of financial collapse it was just a question of waiting for the next one and then marveling at how we could have been so stupid as not to protect ourselves against that. what we desperately need Beyond or along with better rules and reasonably smart incentives is we need virtue we need character. we need people who want to do the right thing and in particular The Virtue that we need most of all is the virtue that Aristotle called practical wisdom. practical wisdom is the moral will to do the right thing and the skill the moral skill to figure out what the right thing is so Aristotle was very interested in watching how the Craftsman around him worked and he was impressed at how they would improvise novel solutions to novel problems problems that they hadn't anticipated so one example is he sees the stonemasons working on the Isle of Lesbos and they need to measure out round columns well if you think about it it's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler. so why do they do they fashion a novel solution to the problem they created a ruler that bends what we would call these days a tape measure. a flexible rule a rule that bends and Aristotle said they appreciated that sometimes to design rounded columns you need to bend the rules and Aristotle said often in dealing with other people we need to bend the rules dealing with other people's demands are kind of flexibility that no set of rules can Encompass a wise people know when and how to bend the rules wise people know how to improvise the way my co-author can and I talked about it they are kind of like jazz musician the rules are are like the notes on the page that get you started but then you dance around notes on the page coming up with just the right combination for this particular moment with his particular set of fellow players. so for Aristotle the kind of of of of of rule-bending except rule exception finding an improvisation that you see and skilled Craftsmen is exactly what you need to be a skilled moral Craftsman and it interactions with people almost all the time it is this kind of flexibility that's required a wise person knows when to bend the rules a wise person knows when to improvise and most important a wise person does this improvising and rule-bending in the service of the right Ames. if you are a real bender and an improviser mostly to Serve Yourself what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people so it matters that you do this wise practice in the service of others and not in the service of yourself and so the will to do the right thing is just as important as the moral skill of improvisation and an exception finding together they comprise practical wisdom which Aristotle thought was the master virtual so. it's the case of Michael Michaels a young guy he was pretty low wage job you were supporting his wife and a child and the child was going to parochial school then he lost his job he panicked about being able to support his family one night he drank a little too much and he robbed a cab driver stole $50 he robbed him at gunpoint it was a toy gun. he got caught he got tried he got convicted the Pennsylvania sentencing guideline required a minimum sentence for a crime like this 2 years 24 months the judge on the case judge Louis for thought that this made no sense he had never committed a crime before he was a responsible husband and father he had been faced with desperate circumstances all this would do is wreck a family and so she improvised the sentence 11 months and not only that but released every day to go to work. spend your night and she'll spend your day holding down a job he did he served out his sentence he made restitution and found himself a new job and the family was United and the and it seemed on the road to some sort of a decent life the happy ending to a story involving wise improvisation from a wise judge. but. it turned out the prosecutor was not happy that judge for ignored the sentencing guidelines and sort of invented her own and so he appealed. if he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery you did after all have a toy gun the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robberies 5 years. he won the appeal Michael was sentenced to five years in prison. judge for had to follow the law. and by the way this appeal went through after he had finished serving his sentence so he was out and working at a job and taking care of his family had to go back into jail charge for did what she was required to do and then she quit the bench. and Michael disappeared. so that is an example both of wise wisdom in practice and the subversion of wisdom by rules that are meant of course to make things better not considered a teacher in the Texas elementary school she found herself listening to a consultant one day who was trying to help teachers boost the test scores of the kids so that the school would reach the elite category in percentage of kids passing big test all these schools in Texas compete with one another to achieve these milestones and there are bonuses and various other treats that come if you beat the other schools. so here was the Consultants advice first don't waste your time on kids who are going to pass the test no matter what you do. don't waste your time on kids who can't pass the test no matter what you do. don't waste your time on kids who moved into the district too late for their scores to be counted. Focus all of your time and attention on the kids who are on the bubble the so-called bubble kid his where your intervention can get them just maybe over the line from failing to pass. don't miss do we heard this and she shook her head in despair while fellow teachers were torturing each other on and Notting approvingly right there cuz like they were about to go play a football game this form is Dewey if this isn't why she became a teacher. now Ken and I are not naive and we understand that you need to have rules you need to have incentives people have to make a living but the problem with relying on rules and incentives is that they demoralize professional activity and they demoralize professional activity in two senses first they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity search for quits and miss doing is completely disheartened and second they demoralize the activity itself the very practice is tomorrow lies and the practitioners are demoralized it creates people when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing it creates people who are addicted to incentives that is to say it creates people who only do things for incent now the Striking thing about this is that psychologists have known this for thirty years psychologists have known about the. negative consequences of incentivizing everything for 30 years we know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures they stopped caring about the drawing and care only about the reward if your reward kids for reading books they stopped caring about what in the books and only care about how long they are if you were a war teachers for kids test scores they stopped caring about educating and only care about test preparation if you were to reward doctors for doing more procedures which is the current system they would do more if instead you a reward doctors from doing fewer procedures they will do fewer what we want of course is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures and do the right amount for the right reason namely to serve the welfare of their patients psychologists have known this for decades and it's time for policymakers to start paying attention and listen to psychologists a little bit instead of economist. and it doesn't have to be this way we think can deny that there are real sources of hope we identify one set of people in all of these practices who we call Kenny Outlaws these are people who are being forced to operate in a system that demands rule-following and creates incentives find a way around the rules find a way to survive through so there are teachers who have these scripts to follow and they know that if they follow these scripts the kids will learn nothing and so what they do is they follow the script but they follow the script at double time and squirrel away little bits of extra time during which they teach in the way that they actually know is effective so he's our little ordinary everyday Heroes and their incredibly admirable but there's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity in the face of a system that either Roots them out or grinds them down so. nothing but it's hard to imagine any can an outlaw sustaining that for an indefinite period of time more hopeful or people we call system change these are people who are looking not to dodge the systems out rules and regulations but to transform the system and we talked about several there's one in particular is a judge named Robert Russell and one day he was faced with the case of Gary Pettingill. Pettingill was a twenty-three-year-old vet who had planned to make the Army a career but then he got a severe back injury in a rock and that forced him to take a medical discharge he was married third kit on the way he suffered from PTSD in addition to the bad back and recurrent nightmares and it started using marijuana to ease some of the symptoms he was only able to get part-time work because of his back and so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table and take care of his family so we started selling marijuana he was busted in a drug sweep. his family was kicked out of their apartment and the welfare system was threatening to take away his kids. under normal sentencing procedures judge Russell would have had little choice but to sentence Pettingill to Serious jail time as a drug-filled but judge Russell's did have an alternate and that's because he was in a special Court he was in a court called the veterans court in the veterans court this was the first of its kind in the United States judge Russell created the veterans court it was a court only for veterans who had broken the law and he had created it exactly because mandatory sentencing laws were taking the Judgment out of judge no one wanted nonviolent offenders and especially nonviolent offenders who were veterans to boot to be thrown into prison they wanted to do something about what we all know namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system and what the veterans court did was it treated each criminal as an individual tried to get inside their problems tried. fashion responses to their crimes that help them to rehabilitate themselves and didn't forget about them once the Judgment was made stayed with them followed up on them made sure that they were actually sticking to whatever plan had been jointly developed to get them over the hump there are now twenty two cities that have veterans courts like this why has the idea spread well one reason is that judge Russell has now seen 108 vets in his veterans court as of February of this year and out of 108 guess how many have gone back through the revolving door of Justice into prison. not not anyone would glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record so here is a system change and it seems to be there are there's a banker who created a for-profit community bank that encouraged Bankers I know this is hard to believe encouraged Bankers to work there to do well by doing good for their low-income clients the bank help Finance the rebuilding of what was otherwise a dying Community though their loan recipients were high-risk by ordinary standards the default rate was extremely low the bank was profitable. the banker stayed with their long recipients they didn't make loans and then sell the loan they service the loans they made sure that their loan recipients were staying up with their payment banking hasn't always been the way we read about it now in the newspapers even Goldman Sachs once used to serve clients before it turned into an institution that serves only itself thanking wasn't always this way and it doesn't have to be this way. so there are examples like this in medicine doctors at Harvard or trying to transfer medical education so that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion and loss of empathy which characterizes most medical students in the course of their medical training and the way they do it is to give third-year medical student patients who they follow for an entire year so the patients are not organ systems and they're not diseases are people people with lives and in order to Be an Effective doctor you need to treat people who have lied and not just disease in addition to wish has an enormous amount of back-and-forth mentoring of one student by another of all the students by the doctors and the result is a generation we hope of doctors who do have time for the people they treat will see so there are lots of examples like this that we talked about each of them shows that it is possible to build on and nurture character and keep a profession true to its proper mission. style would have called his property loss. and 10 and I believe that this is what practitioners actually want people want to be allowed to be virtuous they want to have permission to do the right thing they don't want to feel like they need to take a shower to get the moral grime off their bodies every day when they come home from work. Aristotle thought that practical wisdom was the key to happiness and he was right there's not a lot of research being done in psychology on what makes people happy and the two things that jump out and study after study I know this will come as a shock to all of you the two things that matter most to happiness or love and work. love managing successfully relations with the people who are close to you and with the communities of which you are part work engaging in activities that are meaningful and satisfying if you have that good close relations with other people work that's meaningful and fulfilling you don't much need anything else well to love well and to work well you need wisdom rules and incentives don't tell you how to be a good friend how to be a good parent how to be a good spouse or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher rules and incentives are no substitutes for wisdom indeed we argue there is no substitute for wisdom and so practical wisdom. does not require act heroic acts of Soul Sacrifice on the part of practitioners in giving us the will and the skill to do the right thing to do right by others practical wisdom also gives us the will and the skill to do right by ourselves thanks,0.765625,
40,BartWeetjens_2010X.sph.wav,talking ninety five now princess diana is announcing on tv that landmines form a structural barrier to any development which is really true as long as these devices are there or there is suspicion of landmines you can't really enter into the land actually there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable because aren't they vermin well actually rats are contrary to what most people think about them rats are left and right there the animal finds a mine it scratches on the soil and the animal comes back for a food reward very very simple very sustainable in this environment here the animal gets its food reward and that's how it works very very simple i'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey extraordinarily rewarding journey actually which brought me into now why would you use rats rats have been used since the fifties last century in all kinds of experiments rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species they're extremely sensitive to smell moreover they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about how do we communicate with rats well don't talk rat but we have a clicker a standard method for animal training which you see there a clicker which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors first of all we associate the click sound with a food reward which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe once the animal knows click food click food click food so click is food we bring it in a cage with and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed and to do that for five seconds five seconds which is long for a rat once the animal knows this we make the task a bit more difficult it learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes up to ten holes then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets in the next step training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis there's a number of mines placed blindly and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the just like dogs by the way maybe one slight difference we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog this is our team in mozambique one tanzanian trainer who transfers the skills to these three mozambican fellows and you should see the pride in the eyes of these people they have a skill which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid moreover this small team together with of course you need the heavy vehicles and the manual deminers to follow up with this small investment in a rat capacity we have demonstrated in mozambique that we can reduce the cost price per sq meter up to sixty percent of what is currently normal two dollars per sq meter we do it at one point one eight and we can still bring that price down question of scale as a child i had two passions one was a passion for rodents if you can bring in more rats we can actually make the output even bigger we have a demonstration site in mozambique eleven african governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology they have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the great lakes region and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines but let me bring you to a very different problem and there's about six thousand people last year that walked on a landmine but last year almost one point nine million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection especially in africa where t b and hiv are strongly linked there is a huge common problem microscopy the standard who procedure reached from forty to sixty percent reliability in tanzania the numbers don't lie forty five percent of people t b patients all kinds of rats mice hamsters gerbils squirrels you name it i bred it and i sold them to b secondary infections and if however you are detected very early diagnosed early treatment can start and even in hiv positives it makes sense you can actually cure t b even in hiv positives so in our common language dutch the name for which etymologically refers to the smell of tar already the old chinese and actually published documented that t b can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients so what we did is we collected some samples just as a way of testing from hospitals trained rats on them and this works and wonder well we can reach eighty nine percent sensitivity eighty six percent specificity using how it works and really this is a generic technology how does it work you have a cassette with of a second to discriminate the scent so it goes extremely fast here it's already at the third sample i also had a passion for africa growing up in a multicultural environment we had african students in the house and i learned about their stories which patients are positive which are like this provided that you have rats and we have now currently twenty five tuberculosis rats a cage like this operating throughout the day can process one thousand six hundred and eighty samples five clinics in dar es salaam on a population of five hundred thousand people where fifteen thousand reported to get we were able to increase case detection rates by over thirty percent throughout last year we've been different backgrounds dependency on imported know how goods services exuberant cultural diversity depending on which intervals you take we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in dar es salaam between thirty and forty percent so this is really considerable knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to fifteen people healthy people per year you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives at least our hero rats have saved lots of lives the way forward for us is now to standardize this technology and there are simple things like for instance we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds so to standardize this also to standardize the and to semi automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people to conclude there are also other applications at the horizon here is a first prototype of our camera rat which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on this is in a prototype stage we don't have a working system here yet to conclude i would actually like to say you may think this is about rats these projects but in the end it is about people it is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks and doing that with a local resource plenty available so something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you whether they are environmental technological animal or human and to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable work thank you very much i started working in the industry but i wasn't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear extracting and manufacturing mode i quit my job to focus on the real world problem,1,"I'm get today to share with you an extraordinary Journey extraordinary rewarding Journey actually. which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting long to mines and tuberculosis as a child I had two passions one was a passion for rodents. I had all kinds of rats mice hamsters gerbils squirrels you name it I bread it and it's open to Pet Shops. I also had a passion for Africa. growing up in a multicultural environment we had African students in the house and I learned about their stories so different backgrounds dependency on imported to know how boost Services exuberant cultural diversity Africa was truly fascinating for me I became an industrial engineer engineer in product development and I focused on the affection Technologies actually the first appropriate Technologies for developing countries. I started working in the industry but I wasn't really happy to contribute to a material consumer Society in a linear extracting and Manufacturing mode. I quit my job to focus on the real world problem with mines. we're talkin 95 now Princess Diana is announcing on TV that like mine's for more structural Berea to any development which is really true as long as these devices are there or do we suspicion of landmines you can't really enter into the land worldwide for new detectors sustainable. in their environment where they needed to produce which is mainly in the developing World which house rats why would you choose rats because aren't they turning well actually rats are in concert to what most people think about them rats are highly sociable creatures in our products what you see here there's a Target somewhere here you see an operator a train to African with his rat in France who actually left and right there then we'll find some minor scratches on the soil and the animal comes back for a food rewards. very very simple very sustainable in this environment. hear the animal gets its food rewards and that's how it works very very simple. now why would you use rats rats have been used since the fifties last century in all kinds of experiments rats have more genetic material allocated to affection than any other mammal species they're extremely sensitive to smell moreover they have the mechanisms to Matt all these smells and to communicate about it. now how do we communicate with rest well we we don't talk rats but we have a clear standard methods for animal training which you see there which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors first of all we associate the click science with the food rewards which is mashed banana and Tina's together in a syringe. once the animal click foots Creek Foods click through to klikus food we bring it in a cage with the hole and actually the animal learns to stick their nose in the hole under Wichita get Cynthia's place and to do that for 5 seconds 5 Seconds which is long for rat why is the animal knows this will make the task a bit more difficult it learned how to find the target smell in the cage with several holes up to 10 holes animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find Targets. The Next Step animals to learn to find real mines in real minefields are tested in a credit dogs have to pass a test which consists of four hundred square meters does the number of Mines number of Mind surf playlist blindly and team of trainer and the rat had to find a oldie oldie targets as an animal to be operational in the field. just like dogs by the way maybe one slight difference we can train right at the Feast of the price of the train to the mining dog this is our team in Mozambique One X enhanced trainer who transfers the skills to these three mozambican fellows and you should see the price in the eyes of these people they have a skill which makes them much less dependence on foreign eight more over this smoking together with of course you need to have your vehicles in the manual the miners to follow up but with this small investments in and wrap capacity we have demonstrated in Mozambique that we can reduce the cost price per square meter. up to 60% of what is currently normal $2 per square metre we do it at 1.18 and we can still bring that flies down question of scale if you can bring him more rats we can actually make that even bigger we have a demonstration site in Mozambique. 11 African governments has seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology they have signed a pact forties and treating the Great Lakes region and. they endorsed hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines very different about 6,000 people last year that walked on the landline twice last year almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection. especially in Africa where TB and HIV are strongly linked there is a huge coming problem. reaches from forty to sixty percent reliability in Tanzania the numbers don't lie 45% of people get TB patients get diagnosed with TV before they die that means that if you have TD. if more chance that you won't be detected but it will just die from TB secondary infections in to them and. he probably ever you're detected very early diagnosed early treatment can start an evening hiv-positive it makes sense you can actually curity be even in hiv-positive. in our common language Dutch the name for TV is staring which it seemed a logical refers to the smell of tar. already the old Chinese and the Greek Epocrates have actually published documented that TV can be diagnosed based on the volatile 6 shooting from a patient's. so what we did this week collect some samples which has a way of testing from hospitals train track from them and see if this work and wonder well we can reach 89% sensitivity 86% specificity using multiple rest in a row this is how it works. and really this is a generic Technologies I just talk now explosives tuberculosis but can you imagine you can actually put anything under there. so how did it work have a chat with 10 samples 50 Cent samples at once in the case and animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the sensor goes extremely fast here it's already at the third sample is it supposed to be sampled.get the clicks on Samsung J-3 keyboard. and by doing so very fast we can have like a second blind opinion where to see which patients are supposed to be which are negative. just as an indication where as a microscope is can process 40 samples in a day a rat can process the same amount of samples in 7 minutes only the case like this. a case like this provided that you have rats and we have now is currently 25 but to be close is rat cage like this operating two hours a day can processed 1680 samples. can you imagine the potential of spring applications Environmental Protection of pollutant since oils Customs application detection of illicit Goods in containers and Swan. realistic fursuit super close I just want to briefly highlight the blue rocks are the scores of microscopy only in the five clinics in Dar es Salaam on the population of 500,000 people wear 15,000 reported to get the test to dump microscopy 4800 patients and by just presenting those samples once more to the rats and looping those results back we were able to increase Casey take some rates by over 30% throughout last year will be depending on which in the vows you take we've been consistently increasing Casey Texan rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between 30 and 40%. so this really considerable knowing that the Mist station by microscopy insects up to 15 people healthy people per year you can be sure that we're safe lot supplies at least our hero rats have safe multiplies to standardize this technology and they're simple things like for instance we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick 45 seconds so to standardize he's also to standardize the ballots the food rewards and to semi-automated in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people. computer has also other applications at the whole resume here is the first prototype of a our camera red switch is a rat with red backpack with a camera that can go under Rubble to detect for victims after earthquake into am using the Prototype stage we don't have a working system yet. to conclude I would actually like to save you may think this is about rats this project but in the end it is about 2 people it is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks and doing that with a local resource plenty of available do something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about. the Resort's is surrounding you whether they are environmental technological animal or human and. to respectfully harmonized with them in order to foster a sustainable world thank you very much.I'm doing the creative Direction the magazine I work as a photographer I also have been curating I do anything and everything related to photography that I can. She is a fine art and culture Journal we know so many creative people and we wanted to sort of give people form to do projects that they might not be able to do for other magazines my Blackberry works with my lifestyle because I actually work for my phone going back and forth with different clients constantly if we're planning an issue of the magazine I'm looking at proofs on my phone the new one has a a keypad and also a touchscreen I really like the keypad I could not write long emails on a phone but just had a touchscreen there's no way. I started taking pictures seriously when I was about Seventeen but I just didn't think it was going to be my job up until very recently all of my personal work with pictures of just like what was around me if I'm in sitting room with friends I usually have my camera take a picture when I see Connie. the quality of the camera on the BlackBerry is definitely good enough that I can do almost anything I want online with him I contribute to a couple different blogs aside from the dossier bought a lot of pictures from wherever I am taking with my Bakker this is Rainbow Eucalyptus in Maui and it it grows by the side of the road was taken from the top of the pompidou in Paris the line to get in does a hedgehog in the souk in America the inside of my dog's mouth I just travel a lot for work you know I have my phone with me everywhere I go Works anywhere in the world and that's awesome",0.7096354365348816,
41,BartonSeaver_2010Z.sph.wav,but what if we eat only in the green list you've got pole caught yellowfin tuna here comes from sustainable stocks pole caught no bycatch great for fishermen lots of money supporting local economies but it's a lion of the sea it's a top predator what's the context of this meal am i sitting down in a steakhouse to a sixteen oz portion of do i do this three times a week i might still be in the green list but i'm not doing myself or you or the oceans any favors we have to have a context a gauge for our actions in all this example i've heard that red wine is great for my health and minerals heart healthy that's great i love red wine i'm going to drink so much of it i'm going to be so healthy well how many bottles is it before you tell me that i have a problem so the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs restorative seafood might best be represented not by jaws or by flipper or the gordon 's fisherman but rather by the jolly green giant we must continue to eat the best seafood possible if at all but we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables the best part about restorative seafood though is that it comes on the half shell with a bottle of tabasco and lemon wedges it comes in a five ounce portion of tilapia breaded with dijon mustard this is an easy sell and the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood walmart jamie oliver so i think we have this whole eating this wrong and so i think it's time we change what we expect from our food sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand so let 's start there green foods often represent a way for us to disregard the responsibility as eaters just because it comes from a green source doesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the we have eco friendly shrimp we can make them we have that technology but we can never have any eco friendly all you can eat shrimp buffet it doesn't work heart healthy dinner is a very important part of restorative seafood while we try and manage declining marine populations the media's recommending increased consumption of seafood restorative options this is what we need to favor this is what the green list says but this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment i have a recipe for you it pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean so here we go start with a sixteen oz portion of big fish to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem it allows for us to celebrate the seafood that we're also so fortunate to eat so what do we call this i think we call it restorative seafood i expect a lot from food i expect health and joy and family and community i expect that producing ingredients preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests i was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook and he taught me very early on about the privilege that eating represents i remember well the meals of my childhood they were i get sick when i go to steakhouses i get the meat sweats it's like a hangover from protein it's disgusting but of all the dire news that you'll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans i have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right eat your vegetables it's pretty straightforward so what are we looking for in a meal well for health i'm looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body for joy i'm looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like penance for family i'm looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories for community though we start at the very beginning there's no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact so try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it so if we all take only what we need then we can begin to share the rest we can begin to celebrate we can begin to restore where sustainability is the capacity to endure and maintain restorative is the ability to replenish and progress restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean we need to savor vegetables we need to savor smaller portions of seafood and we need to save dinner thank you as a resource suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency it is a more hopeful it is a more human and is a more useful way of understanding our environment guides standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world are very handy they're a wonderful tool green yellow and red lists seafood species the association is very easy buy green don't buy red think twice about yellow but in my mind it's really not enough to just eat green list we can't sustain this without the measure of our success really changing the fate of the species in the yellow and the red,1,Steve ability represents the what's the weather in the how of what is cut the who win the why or what's important to me I want to know the people behind my dinner choices I want to know how I am packed them I want to know how they impact me I want to know why they fish I want to know how they rely on the water's Bounty for their living understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem. it allows for us to celebrate the seafood that were also so fortunate to eat so what do we call this food and maintain restorative is the ability to replenish and progress restore to Seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource suggesting that we engaged to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency. it is a more hopeful is a more human and is a more useful way of understanding our environment. wallet guides standard-issue buy lots of marine conservation world are very handy they're wonderful tool green yellow and red list Seafood species the association's migraine don't by Red think twice about yellow but in my mind it's really not enough to just eat green list we can't sustain this without the measure of our success really being changing the fate of the species in the yellow in the red. but what if we eat only in the green list yellowfin tuna here comes from sustainable stocks pull cut nobody catches great for fisherman lots of money supporting local economies but it's a line of the see if the top predator am I sitting down what's the context of this meal I sitting down in a steakhouse in a 16 oz portion of this do I do this three times a week I might still be in the green list but I'm not doing myself or you or the oceans any favors. when is that we have to have a contact the gauge for our actions and all this example that red wine is great for my health antioxidants and minerals heart-healthy that's great I love her so much but I'm going to be so healthy. well how many bottles is it before you tell me that I have a problem. we have a protein problem we have lost the sensibility when it regards to our food and we are paying a cost problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves we are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistline and we are hiding that cost behind monster profits. the first thing about this I did restore it and see if it is that really takes into account our needs restored his secret might best be represented not by Jaws or by Flipper the Gordon's fisherman but rather by the Jolly Green Giant. vegetables they might yet save the oceans Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green wide like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue. we must continue to eat best seafood possible if it all but we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables best part about restored and seafood though is that it comes on the Half-Shell with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges comes in a 5 oz portion of tilapia breaded with Dijon mustard crispy broil bread crumbs in a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred Smokey on the outside with just a hint of chili flakes. this is an easy sell the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart. Jamie Oliver is campaigning to save America from the way we eat Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans from the way we eat this pattern here. forget nuclear Holocaust it's the fork that we have to worry about. we have ravaged our Earth and then use the food that we've sourced to handicap ourselves in more ways than one. so I think we have this whole meeting thing wrong and I saw I think it's time we change what we expect from our food sustainability is complicated but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand so let's start there there's been a lot of movement recently in The Greening Our Food Systems Dan Barber and Alice Waters leading passionately that green food delicious Revolution the green Foods often represent a way for us to to disregard the responsibility as eaters just because it comes from a green Source doesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate. we have eco-friendly shrimp we can make them we have that technology but we can never have an eco-friendly all you can eat shrimp Buffet it doesn't work. heart healthy dinner it is a very important part of restorative seafood while we try and manage declining Marine populations the media is recommending increased consumption of seafood study say that tens of thousands of American grandmother's grandfather's mothers and fathers might be around for another birthday if we include more Seafood that's the reward I am not willing to pass up but it's not all about the seafood it's about the way that we look at our plates as a chef I realize the easiest thing for me to do is to reduce the portion sizes on my plate couple things happened I made more money people started appetizers and salads because they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone people spent more time engaging in their meals engaging with each other over their meals people got in short more of what they came here for even though they got less protein they got more calories over the course of a diversified meal they got healthier I made more money this is great. environmental consideration was served with every place but it was served with a heaping mounds of consideration for human interest at the same time. one of the other things we did was it began to diversify the species that we served small silver fish anchovies mackerel sardines for common shellfish mussels or clams these were common species we're directing taste towards more resilience more restorative options. this is what we needs a favor this is what the green list says but this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment but one of those big predators those fashionable species that green let's do the one I was talking about earlier well if you must I have a recipe for you pretty much worse than any big fish in the ocean so here we go get a knife cut it into four portions put it on four plates now. Those four plates with vegetables then open up the very best bottle of burgundy you have light the candles and celebrate it celebrate the opportunity that you have to eat this invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year maybe. I expect a lot from food I expect help enjoy and family and Community I expect it producing ingredients preparing dishes and eating meals is all part of the communion of human interests I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook and he told me very early on about the privilege that eating represents I remember well the meals of my childhood they were reasonable portions of protein served with copious quantities of vegetables and small amount of starch usually rice this is still how I largely eat today I get sick when I go to when I go to steakhouses I got the meat sweats it's like a hangover from protein it's disgusting. but of all of the dire news that you'll hear and that you have heard about the state of our oceans I have the unfortunate brand of delivering to possibly the very worst of it and that is this whole time your mother was right eat your vegetables. pretty straightforward. so what are we looking for in a meal well for help I'm looking for wholesome ingredients that are good for my body for Joy I'm looking for butter and salt and sexy things that make things taste less like pain in her family I'm looking for recipes that genuflect to my own personal histories. for community that we start at the very beginning there's no escaping the fact that everything we eat as a global impact so try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it. we see an image of our Blue Planet our world bank but it is more than just a repository of our resources it's also the global geography of the communion we called dinner. so if we all take only what we need then we can begin to share the rest we can begin to celebrate we can begin to restore. we need to save her vegetables we need to save or smaller portions of seafood and we need to save dinner. thank you. oh very funny. you got me. we are Intel sponsors of tomorrow,0.7565103769302368,
42,BeauLotto_2009G.sph.wav,what i want to talk about is not that context is everything but why is context everything because it's answering that question that tells us not only we see what we do but who we are as individuals and who we are as a society now can any of you see the predator that's about to jump out at you and if you haven't seen it yet you're dead right can anyone see it anyone no now let 's see the surfaces according the quality of light that they reflect and now you see it so color to see the similarities and differences between surfaces according to the full spectrum of light that they reflect but what you've just done is in many respects mathematically impossible why because as berkeley tells us we have no direct access to our physical world other than through our senses and the light that falls on to our eyes is determined by multiple things in the world not only the color of objects i want to start with a game but also the color of their illumination and the color of the space between us and those objects you vary any one of those parameters and you'll change the color of the light that falls to win this game all you have to do is see the reality that's in front of you as it really is all right so we have two panels here of colored dots they are identical in every single way identical in shape size spectral content they are the same as far as your eye is concerned and yet they come from completely different sources the one on the right comes from a yellow surface in shadow oriented facing the left viewed through a pinkish medium the one on the left comes from an orange surface under direct light facing to the right viewed through a sort of a blueish medium completely different meanings giving rise to the exact same retinal information and yet it's only the retinal information that we get so how on earth do we even see so if you remember anything in this next eighteen minutes remember this that the light that falls on to your eye sensory information is meaningless because it could mean literally anything and what's true for sensory information is true for information generally there is no inherent meaning in information it's what we do with that information that matters so how do we see well we see by learning to see so the brain evolved the mechanisms for finding patterns finding relationships in information and associating those relationships with a behavioral meaning a significance by interacting with the world we're very aware of this in the form of more cognitive attributes like language so i'm going to give you some letter strings and i want you to read them out for me if you can and one of those dots is the same in the two panels okay and you have to tell me which one now narrow it down to so you don't do it again so let me show you how quickly our brains can redefine normality even at the simplest thing the brain does which is color so if i could have the lights down up here i want you to first notice that those two desert scenes are physically the same one is simply the flipping of the other okay now i want you to look at that dot between the green and the red okay and i want you to stare at that dot don't look anywhere else and we're going to look at that for about thirty seconds which is a bit of a killer in an eighteen minute talk really want you to learn and i'll tell you don't look anywhere else and i'll tell you what's happening inside your head i tell you i want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes so why don't you do that now have the lights up again i take it from your response they don't look the same right why because is seeing that same information as if the right one is still under red light and the left one is still under green light that's your new normal so what does this mean for context it means that i can take these two identical squares and i can put them in light and dark surrounds and now the one on the dark surround looks lighter than the one on the what's significant is not simply the light and dark surrounds that matter it's what those light and dark surrounds meant for your behavior in the past so i'll show you what i mean here we have that exact same illusion we have two identical tiles on the left one in a dark surround one in a light surround and the same thing over on the right notice that on the left the two tiles look nearly completely opposite one very white and one very dark alright whereas on the right the two tiles look nearly the same and yet there is still one on a dark surround and one on a light surround why because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow it would have to be more reflective just the laws of physics so you see it that way whereas on the right the information is consistent with those two tiles being under the same light if they are under the same light reflecting the same amount of then they must be equally reflective so you see it that way bright orange tile at the side that is your perceptual reality the physical reality is that those two tiles are the same gray one really okay how many people think it's the green one here you see four gray tiles on your left seven gray tiles on the right i'm not going to change those tiles at all but i'm going to reveal the rest of the and see what happens to your perception the four blue tiles on the left are gray the seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray they are the same okay don't believe me let 's watch it again what's true for color is also true for complex perceptions of motion so here we have let 's turn this around a diamond and what i'm going to do is i'm going to hold it here and and for all of you you'll see it probably spinning this direction now i want you to keep looking at it move your eyes around blink maybe close one eye and suddenly it will flip and start spinning the opposite direction yes raise your hand if you got that yes keep blinking every time you blink it will switch alright so i can ask you which direction is it rotating how do you know your brain doesn't know because both are equally likely so depending on where it looks it flips between the two possibilities and how many people think it's the orange one sees illusions does the most complicated things that even our most sophisticated computers can't do so in my lab we of course work on bumblebees because we can completely control their experience and see how that alters the architecture of their brain and we do this in what we call the bee matrix and here you have the hive you can see the queen bee that large bee in the middle there those are all her daughters the eggs and they go back and forth between this and the arena via this tube and you'll see one of the bees come right we pull them out put them in the fridge and they fall asleep and then you can superglue little numbers on them and sometimes they learn not to go to the blue but to go to where the other bees go so they copy each other they can count to five they can recognize faces and here she comes down the ladder and she'll come into the hive find an empty honey pot and throw up and that's honey let 's find out what the reality is here is the orange one now remember and the answer to the question is no those are actually blue flowers but those are blue flowers under green light so they are using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle which is exactly what we do so illusions are often used especially in art in the words of a more contemporary artist to demonstrate the fragility of our senses okay this is complete rubbish the senses aren't fragile and if they were we wouldn't be here instead the brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past and how we see is by continually redefining so how can we take this incredible capacity of plasticity of the brain and get people to experience their world one of the ways we do in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound and we enable people to hear their visual world here is the green one and here is the gray one and they can navigate the world using here is david in the right and he is holding a camera on the left is what his camera sees and you'll see there is a line a faint line going across that image that line is broken up into thirty two squares in each square we calculate the average color and then we just simply translate that into sound and now he 's going to turn around and find a plate on the he finds it amazing right so not only can we create a prosthetic for the visually impaired but we can also investigate so working with kids they created images thinking about what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them and then we translated these images and this is one of those images and this is a six year old child composing now what does all this mean what this suggests is that no one is an outside observer of nature okay we are not defined by our central properties by the bits that make us up defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment by our ecology and that ecology is necessarily relative historical and so what i'd like to finish with is this over here because what i've been trying to do is really celebrate uncertainty because i think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding so if some of you are still feeling a bit too certain i'd like to do this one so if we have the lights down so this pretty amazing actually isn't it because nearly every living system has evolved the ability to detect light in one way or another so for us what we have here can everyone see twenty five purple surfaces on your left right now you can see that changes the light that's coming through there right because now the light is going yellowish filter and then a purplish filter i'm going to do this opposite on the left here i'm going to put the middle nine under purplish light now some of you will notice that the consequence is that the light coming through those middle nine on the right or your left is exactly the same as the light coming through the middle nine on your right agreed yes okay so they are physically the same let 's pull the covers off remember you know the middle nine are exactly the same do they look the same no the question is is that an illusion and i'll leave you with that so thank you very much seeing color is one of the simplest things the brain does and yet even at this most fundamental level context is everything,1,I want to start with the game okay and to win this game all you have to do is see the reality that's in front of you as it really is all right we have two panels here of color dots and one of those doctors the same in the two panels. okay and you have to tell me which one it down two. the gray one the green one and say the orange one so by a show of hands. With the easiest one shorthand how many people think it's the gray one. really okay how many people think it's the green one. and how many people think it's the orange one. so pretty even split so. let's find out what the reality is here is the orange one. all right here's the green one. and here's the gray one. sophrology saw that your complete really all right. so this is pretty amazing actually isn't it because nearly every living system has evolved the ability to detect light in one way or another so for us seeing color is one of the simplest things the brain does when you're even at this most fundamental level context is everything okay what I want to talk about is not that context is everything but why is context everything because it's answering that question that tells us not only why we see what we do but who we are as individuals and who we are as a spicy. but first we have to ask another question which is what is color for instead of telling you I'll just show you what you see here is a jungle City and you see the surfaces according to the amount of light that goes with this is a flat now can any of you see the Predator that's about to jump out at you and if you haven't seen that yet you're dead right. can anyone see it and I know now let's see the surface is according to the quality of life that they respect and now you see it right so as to see the similarities and differences between surface according to the full spectrum of light they reflect but what you've just done is in many respects mathematically impossible why because he tells us we have no direct access to our physical world other than through our senses and the light the falls on tries is determined by multiple things in the world not only the color of objects but also the color of their illumination and the color of the space between us and those objects you very any one of those parameters and you'll change the color of the light that falls onto I. this is a huge problem because it means that the same image could have an infinite number of possible real-world sources let me show you what I mean I'm not saying that this is the back of your eye okay and these are two projections from the world they're identical in every single way identical in shape size spectral content they are the same as far as your eyes concerned. and yet they come from completely different sources. the one on the right comes from a yellow surface in Shadow oriented facing the left due to a pinkish medium the one on the left comes from an orange surface under direct light facing to the right do you have to sort of a bluish meeting completely different meanings giving rise to the exact same retinal information and yet it's only the rental information that we guess. so how on Earth do we even see. so if you remember anything in this next 18 minutes remember this that the light that falls onto your eye sensory information is meaningless because it could mean literally anything and what's true for sensory information is true for information generally there's no inherent meaning and information it's what we do with that information that matters. so how do we say well we see by learning to see so the brain evolve the mechanisms for finding pattern finding relationships and information and associating those relationships with a behavioral meaning of significant by interacting with the world we're very aware of this in the form of more caucus baskets like language so I'm going to give you some if you can.what are you reading half the letters are missing right there's no a priori reason why a h has to go between that wna but you put one there why because of the statistics of your past experience it would have been used to do so you do so again and yet you don't put a letter after that first t y because it would have been useful in the past so you don't do it again. so let me show you how quickly our brains can read fine normality even at the simplest in the brain does which is color so if I could have the lights down up here. I want you to First notice but those two desert scenes are physically the same when is simply the flipping of the other okay. now I want you to look at that. Between the green and the red okay and what you just stare at that. Don't look anywhere else we're going to look at that for about 30 seconds which is a bit of a killer in an 18-minute talk. okay but I really want you to learn and I'll tell you don't look anywhere else and I'll tell you what's happening inside your head your brain is learning and it's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination left side of its visual field is under green elimination that's what it's learning. so why don't you do that now. do you have the lights off again so I take it from your response they don't look the same anymore right. why because your brain is seeing that same information as if the right one is still under red light and the left one is still in a dreamlike that's your new normal okay so what does this mean for contacts that means I can take these two identical squares and I can put them in lights and darks around smell the one on the dark's Roundup fly to the one the lights around what significant is not simply the lights and darks around the matter is what does light and dark trousers meant for your behavior in the past so I'll show you what I mean here we have that exact same illusion we have two identical tiles on the left one in a dark strong one of the lights on and the same thing over on the right and I want to give you those two things but I'm not going to change anything within those boxes step their meaning and see what happens to your perception notice it on the left the two tiles look nearly completely office at 1 very wife and one very dark right nearly the same. and yet there is still one in a dark brown and one of my lights run why because is the tile in that shadow of war in fact and Shadow and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye is the one outside the shadow it would have to be more effective just the laws of physics so you see it that way where is on the right information is consistent with those two titles being under the same light if they're under the same light reflecting the same amount of likes your eye then you must be equally effective so you see it that way which means we can bring all this information together to create me some incredibly strong Illusions this is when I made a few years ago and you'll notice you see a dark brown tile at the top and a bright orange pilot beside that is your perception reality the physical reality is that the same. here you see for gray tiles on your left seven gray tiles on the right I'm not going to change those Tiles at all but I'm going to review the rest of the scene and see what happens to your perception. the four blue tiles in the left are gray the seven yellow towels on the right are also gray they are the same okay don't believe me just watch it again. what's true for colors also true for complex perception promotion so here we have. turn this around a diamond. and what I'm going to do is I'm going to hold it here and I'm going to spin it. and for all of you probably spending this direction and I want you to keep looking at it. move your eyes around blink maybe close one eye and suddenly the flip and start spinning the opposite direction yes raise your hand if you got that. yes keep blinking every time you blink you don't switch right so I can ask you which direction is it rotated. how do you know. your brain doesn't know because both are equally likely so depending on where it looks it slips between the two possibilities. are we the only ones with the Illusions the answer to this question is no even the beautiful Bumblebee with his mirror 1 million brain cells which is 250 x fewer sales you have one retina these Illusions does the most complicated things that even our most sophisticated computers can't do so am I allowed me of course work on bumblebees because we can completely control and see how the altars architecture of the rain we supposed to be Matrix and here you have the hide and see the queen bee that large be in the middle there those are all our daughter is the eggs and then go back and forth between his Hive and the reason why this tube. and you'll see one of the bees come out here you see if you have a number on her. yeah there's another one coming out she also has a number on her. I do not born that way right we pull them out put them in the fridge and they fall asleep to make them super glue with numbers on them right. I know in this experiment they get rewards to go to the blue flowers can they land on the flower they stick their tongue in there and they drink sugar water to that about three times and then fly. and sometimes they learn not to go to the flu but to go to where the other bees go so they talk to each other they can count to five I can recognize faces and here she comes down the ladder and she'll come into the high find an empty honey pot and throw up and that's honey okay now remember. she's supposed to be going to the blue flowers but one of these days he's doing an upper right corner it looks like they're going to green flowers. no are they getting it wrong and answer the question is no those are actually blue flowers but those are blue flowers under green light so the using the relationship between the colors to solve puzzle which is exactly what we do so Illusions are often use especially in art by in the words of a more contemporary art is to demonstrate the fragility of our senses into this is complete rubbish we wouldn't be here. ant anstead the brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past and how we see is why continually redefining normality. so. how can we take this incredible capacity of plasticity of the brain and get people to experience the world differently when one of the ways we do in my lab and studio is we translate the light in the sound and we nabel people to hear their visual World okay and they can navigate the world using their ears. here is David in the right and he's holding a camera on the left is what his camera season you'll see there's a line a faint line going across that image that line is woke up with 32 squares and square roots average color and then we just simply translate that's in the sound and now he's going to. turn around closes eyes. and find a plate on the ground with his eyes closed. he finds it amazing right so not only can we create a prosthetic for the visually impaired but we can also investigate investigate how people literally make sense of the world but we can also do something else we can also make music with color so working with kids they traded images thinking about what might the image of disease found like if we can listen to them and then we translated these images and this is one of those images and this is a 6 year old child composing a piece of music for a 32-piece Orchestra and this is what it sounds like.so a 6 year old child okay now what does all this mean. what does suggest is that no one is an outside Observer of nature okay we're not defined by a central Properties by the bits that make us up where to find by our environment and our interaction with that environment biology and ecology is necessarily relative historical in a couple right so what I'd like to finish with is this over here because what I've been trying to do is really celebration certainty because I think Alicia uncertainty is there potential for understanding so if somebody was still feeling a bit too certain I'd like to do this one so if we have the lights down and. what we have. here. can I burn c25 purple surfaces on your left and 25 yellowish surfaces on your right so now what I'm going to do I'm going to put the middle nine surfaces of here under yellow illumination by simply putting a filter behind them. right now you can see that changes the light that's coming through there right cuz now the lights going through a yellowish filter and then a purplish filter I'm going to do the opposite the last year I'm going to put the middle 9 under a purpose light okay now some of you have noticed that the consequence is that the light coming through those middle 9 on the right or your left is exactly the same as a light coming through the middle nine on your right yes okay so they are physically the same. this pulled the covers off. now I remember. do you know that the middle 9 or exactly the same do they look the same. no question is is that an illusion and I'll leave you with that so thank you very much. traffic is a global epidemic traffic is creating 45% of the world's pollution in the UK time wasted in traffic cost

I quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in February that same year and decided to travel. his death hit me pretty hard and there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with all this doing that so. I can't my whole life and I decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip so I packed my cat my Rottweiler and my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van and I drove off into the sunset having fully failed to realize three critical things one that Society equates living in a permanent structure even Shaq with having value as a person to I failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality if we let it and three fail to realize that homelessness is an attitude not a lifestyle. the first living in the van was great I showered and campgrounds I ate out regularly and I had time to relax and to grieve. but then the anger in the depression about my father's death set in. my freelance job and it and I had to get a full-time job to pay the bills. would have been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer and it became impossible to park anywhere without it being very obvious that I had a cat and a dog with me and it was really hot the cat came and went through the open window in the van the dog you went to doggie daycare and I sweated whenever I could I used employee showers in Office Buildings in truck stops are washed up and in public restrooms. nighttime temperatures in the band rarely drops below 80 degrees Fahrenheit making it difficult or impossible to sleep food right it in the heat ice in my ice chest melted within hours and no it was it was pretty miserable. I couldn't afford to find an apartment or could afford an apartment that would allow me to have the Rottweiler in the cat and I refuse to give them up so I stayed in the van. when the heat made me. too sick to walk the 50 Feet to the public restroom outside my van at night I use a bucket and a trash bag is a toilet when winter weather set in the temperatures dropped below freezing and they stay there and I faced a whole new set of challenges. I parked a different place every night so I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police I didn't always succeed but. I felt out of control of my life and I don't know when or how it happened but the speed at which I went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman living in a van took my breath away I hadn't changed my IQ hadn't dropped my talent. my Integrity my values everything about me remain the same but I changed somehow. a spiral deeper and deeper into a depression and eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic and I went I hadn't bathed in three days how is the smelly and is depressed is anyone in line. I just wasn't drunk or high. and with several of the homeless man realize that. including a former University Professor they said you weren't homeless why are you really here other homeless people didn't see me as homeless but I did. then the professor listen to my story and he said. you have a job. you have hope the real homeless don't have hope. reaction to medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal and I remember thinking if I killed myself no one would notice. a friend. a friend told me shortly after that that she had heard that Tim Russert a nationally renowned journalist have been talking about me on national TV and if they had written about my father the year before he died. wasn't a new book and he was doing the talk show circuit and he was talking about my writing when I realized it Tim Russert for my moderator of Meet the Press was talking about my writing while I was living in a van in a Walmart parking lot I started laughing you should too I started laughing because it got to the point where was I right or was I a homeless woman so I went the bookstore and I found Tim's book and I stood there and I reread my essay and I cried. because I was a writer I was a writer. shortly after that I moved back to Tennessee I alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends and I started writing again. by the summer of the following year I was a working journalist I was winning Awards I was living in my own apartment I was no longer homeless and it was no longer invisible. thousands of people work full and part-time jobs and live in their cars but Society continues to stigmatize and criminalized living in your vehicle or on the streets. so the homeless the working home was primarily remain invisible but if you ever meet one and gauge them encouraged them and offer them hope. the human Spirit can overcome anything if it has hope. and I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless and I'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next Panhandle your meat but I am here to tell you that based on my experience people are not where they live where they sleep or what their life situation is at any given time. 3 years ago I was living in a van in a Walmart parking lot and today I'm speaking at Ted Hope always always finds a way thank you. traffic is a global epidemic traffic is creating 45% of the world's pollution in the UK time wasted in traffic cost twenty billion a year would you place a clean the number to Foster commute Stockholm put it to a vote for it. how to do something install come to improve the environment to end to get the better of a flow in the traffic with put a price on taking your car into the center Palo Alto stock on a cold that congestion charges. if you stop a system that system doesn't work on the first day then you would be in big trouble if not the perfect from Davon. eating a gates to the city each is equipped with cameras on the rear and front license plates these pictures are sent to Central system that identifies the license plates and make sure that the right person pays for the right passages of the license plate we went out to IBM's Global organization and the R&D centres and find a very good software we could use a weight management Limited in two months time to 9 % of old pictures are correctly identified.

44,BenCameron_2010X.sph.wav,now competes with between three and five thousand different marketing messages a typical citizen see every single day we now know in fact that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time five yeas ago gen x 'ers spent twenty point seven hours online and tv the majority on tv gen y 'ers spent even more twenty three point eight hours the majority online and now a typical university entering student arrives at college already having spent twenty thousand hours online and an additional ten thousand hours playing video games we're afraid that technology has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption thanks to the internet we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it delivered to our own doorstep i am a cultural omnivore one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an ipod an ipod that contains wagner and mozart pop diva christina aquilera we can shop at three in the morning or eight at night ordering jeans tailor made for our unique body types expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts which have set curtain times set venues attendant inconveniences of travel parking and the like simply cannot meet and we're all acutely aware what's it going to mean in the future when we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars for a symphony opera or ballet ticket cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet twenty four hours a day for ninety nine cents a song or for free these are enormous questions for those of us who work in this terrain but as particular as they feel to us we know we're not all of us are engaged in a seismic fundamental realignment of culture and communications a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry the magazine industry the book and publishing industry and more saddled in the performing arts as we are by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction and streaming locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the nineteenth century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues where we charge exorbitant prices many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of tower records and ask ourselves are we next everyone i talk to in performing arts resonates to the words of adrienne rich who in doctoreams of a common language wrote we are out in a country that has no language no laws whatever we do together is pure invention the maps they now rather than saying that we're on the brink of our own annihilation i prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental reformation a reformation like the religious reformation of the sixteenth century the arts reformation like the religious reformation is spurred in part by technology with indeed the printing press really leading the charge on the religious reformation both reformations were predicated on fractious discussion internal self doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models and at heart both reformations i think were asking the questions who 's entitled to practice how are they entitled to practice and indeed do we need anyone to intermediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual chris anderson someone i trust you all know editor and chief of wired magazine and author of the long tail really was the first for me to nail a lot of this he wrote a long time ago you know thanks to the invention of the internet web technology mini cams and more the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history and now who in this room doesn't know a fourteen year old hard at work on her second third or fourth movie similarly the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history again in the warner bros rko did that for you now go to youtube facebook you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own this double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market a time when anyone is a potential author but the number of arts participants people who write poetry who sing songs who perform in church choirs is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations and one who lives for my home theater a home theater where i devour dvds video on demand and a lot of television this group others have called the pro ams amateur artists doing work at a professional level you see them on youtube in dance competitions film festivals and more they are radically expanding our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions ultimately we now live in a world defined not by consumption but by participation they currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity not opulence of dignity and they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home but to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community is by far too short sighted and indeed while we've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional for me law and order svu tine fey and thirty rock and judge judy the people are real the cases are real the rulings are the single most exciting development in the last five to ten years has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist the professional artist who works not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage but most frequently around women 's rights or human rights or on global warming issues or aids relief for more not out of economic necessity but out of a deep organic conviction that the work that she or he is called to do cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment today 's dance world is not defined solely by the royal winnipeg ballet or the national ballet of canada but by liz lerman 's dance exchange a multi generational professional dance company whose dancers range in age from eighteen to eighty two and who work with genomic scientists to embody the dna strand and with nuclear physicists at cern today 's professional theater community is defined not only the shaw and stratford festivals but by the cornerstone theater of los angeles a collective of artists that after nine eleven brought together ten different religious communities the muslim the jewish even the native american and the gay and lesbian communities of faith helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play where they explored the differences in their faith and found commonality as an important first step toward cross today 's performers like rhodessa jones work in women 's prisons helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration while today 's playwrights and directors work with young gangs to find alternate channels to violence and more and i'm convinced a lot of you probably share my passions especially my passion for judge judy and more and indeed i think rather than being annihilated the performing arts are posed on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been for a long time we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town and absolutely i hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community and you'd fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us but i'm a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life empathy to articulate change to motivate others the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter especially as we all must confront the fallacy of a market only orientation uninformed by social conscience we must seize and celebrate the power of the arts to shape our individual and national characters and especially characters of the young people who all too often are subjected bombardment of sensation rather than digested experience and in a context of analysis where the thing we hear most repeatedly day in day out in the united states in every train station every bus station every plane station is ladies and gentlemen please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest you when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion the arts whatever they do whenever they call us together invite us a passion for the live professional performing arts performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire yes but jazz as well modern dance opera theater and to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity god knows if we ever needed that capacity in human history we need it you know we're bound together not i think by technology entertainment and design but by common cause we work to promote healthy vibrant societies to ameliorate human suffering to promote a more thoughtful substantive i salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work whatever your purpose may be i promise you the hand of the doris duke charitable foundation is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come and i thank you for your kindness and your patience in listening to me this afternoon thank you and more and more you know frankly it's a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology while we initially heralded the internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems we now realize that the internet is if anything too effective in that regard depending on who you read an arts organization or an artist who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket buyer,1,"I am a cultural omnivore one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an iPod and I popped it contains Vagner and

between three and five thousand different marketing messages a typical citizen sees every single day we now know in fact that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time five years ago at 27 hours online and TV the majority on TV Gen Y 23.8 hours the majority online and now I typically in a typical University entering student arrives at College already having spent $20,000 online and an additional. 10000 hours playing video games a stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context where video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined. moreover we are afraid that technology has altered our various assumptions of cultural consumption thanks to the internet we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it delivered to our own doorstep we can shop at 3 in the morning or 8 at night or during jeans tailor-made for our unique body types X expectations of personalization and customization that the live Performing Arts which I spent curtain time set been used attendant inconveniences of travel parking in the light simply cannot meet. and we're all acutely aware what's it going to mean in the future when we ask someone to pay $100 for a symphony opera or ballet tickets when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet 24 hours a day for 99 cent a song for for free. these are enormous questions for those of us that work in this terrain but it's particular as they feel. We know we're not alone all of us are engaged in a seismic fundamental realignment of culture and Communications a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry the magazine industry the book and Publishing industry and more. saddled in the Performing Arts as we are by Antiquated Union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction in streaming locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the 19th century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues where we charged exorbitant prices mini about shutter in the wake of the collapse of power records and ask ourselves are we next. everyone I talked to him performing arts resonates to the world of age words of Adrienne Rich doing dreams of a Common Language wrote we are out in a country that has no language no laws whatever we do together is pure invention the maps they gave us our out-of-date by years. and for those of you who love the art aren't you glad you invited me here to brighten your day. now rather than saying that we're at the brink of our own Annihilation I prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental Reformation a Reformation like the religious Reformation of the 16th century the Arts Reformation like the religious Reformation is spurred in part by technology with indeed the printing press really leading the charge on the religious Reformation both Reformation for predicated on fractions to an internal self-doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business model and it heart both Reformation so I think we're asking the question who's entitled to practice how are they entitled to practice and indeed do we need anyone to intermediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine. Chris Anderson someone I trust you all know editor-in-chief of Wired Magazine and author of the long tail really with the first for me to nail a lot of this he wrote a long time ago you know thanks to the invention of the internet web cell web technology minicamps and more the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history. in the 1930s if any of you wanted to make a movie you had to work for Warner Brothers are all KO because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment in scoring and more and now who in this room doesn't know what fourteen-year-old hard at work on her second third or fourth movie. similarly the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history again in the 30 go to YouTube Facebook you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom. this double impact is occasionally a massive redefinition of the cultural Market a time when anyone is a potential author. frankly what we're seeing now in this environment is a massive time when the entire world is changing as we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting but the number of Arts participants people who write poetry and sing songs who performance requires is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations. this group other than called the Pro-Am amateur artist doing work at a professional level you see him on YouTube and dance competitions film festivals and more they are radically expanding our Notions of potential of anesthetic vocabulary while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions by consumption but my participation. but I want to be clear just as the religious Reformation did not spell the N to the formal Church of the priesthood I believe that are artistic institutions will continue to have importance they currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lots of economic dignity not opulence of dignity and they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home. but to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the art community is by far too short-sighted. and indeed while we tended to polarize the amateur from the professional the single most exciting development in the last 5 to 10 years has been deprived of the professional hybrid artist the professional artists who works not primarily in the concert hall around the stage but most frequently around women's rights or human rights around global warming issues or Aids relief for more not out of economic necessity but out of a deep organic conviction that the work that she or he is called to do cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic Arts environment. today's Dance World Is Not defined solely by the Royal Winnipeg ballet or the National Ballet of Canada but by Liz luhrmann's dance exchange a multi-generational professional dance company whose dancers range in age from 18 to 82 and who work with your gnome excited to embody the DNA strand and with nuclear physicist at CERN. today's professional theater Community is to find not only by the Sha and Stratford Festival but by the Cornerstone theater of Los Angeles a collective of artists the after 9/11 brought together 10 different religious communities the Baha'i the Catholic the Muslim the Jewish even the Native American and the gay and lesbian Community of Faith helping them create their own individual place and one massive play where they explored the differences in their faith and found commonality as an important first step toward cross community healing. today's performers like we're definitely going to work in women's prison helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration plus today's playwrights and directors work with youth gangs do you find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more. and indeed I think rather than being annihilated to performing art or voice on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been. you know we said for a long time we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town and absolutely I hope you know that every dollar spent on the Performing Arts ticket in the community generates 527 additional dollars for the local economy dollar spending restaurants on parking at the fabric stores where you buy fabric for costumes the piano tuner Tuesday instruments and more. the article to be more important to economy since we go forward especially industry we can't even imagine yet just as they have been Central to the iPod and the computer game industry which few if any of us could have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago. business leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence the ability to listen deeply to have empathy to articulate change to motivate others than very capacities that the Arts cultivate with every encounter. especially now as we all must confront the fallacy of a market only orientation uninformed by social conscience we must seize and celebrate the power of the Arts to shape our individual and National characters and especially characters of the young people who all too often are subjected to bombardment of sensation rather than digested experience. ultimately especially now in this world where we live in a contact of regressive and owners immigration laws in reality TV that thrives on humiliation and in a context of announcements for the thing we hear most repeatedly day in day out in the United States and every train station every bus station every plane station is ladies and Gentlemen please report any suspicious behaviour or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest you when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion. the ark whatever they do whenever they call us together invite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity. I know if we have ever needed that capacity in human history we need it now. you know we're bound together not I think by technology entertainment design but by common cause. we worked 10 healthy vibrant Society to ameliorate human suffering to promote a more thoughtful substitute empathic World Order. I salute all of you is activist in that Quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the Arts in your work whatever your purpose may be. I promise you the hand of the Doris Duke charitable Foundation is stretched out in Friendship for now and years to come and I thank you for your kindness in your patience and listening to me this afternoon thank you and Godspeed. somewhere in America there's a doctor who can peer into the future there's a nurse who can access in an instant every patient's past and because the whole Hospital's working together there's a family who can breathe easy right now somewhere in America we've already answered some of the nation's toughest Healthcare questions and they over 60,000 people of scene are ready to do it again Siemens answers",0.7486978769302368,
45,BenDunlap_2007.sph.wav,meal and then they got into a furious argument and what they were arguing about was this whether the second harry potter movie was as good as the first and doctor robicsek reeled back in his chair but quickly gathered his wits leaned forward and said well that is true but i'll bet you went to the movie with a grandchild i did conceded mister milliken aha said doctor robicsek i went to the movie all by myself and i realized in this moment of revelation that what these two men were revealing was the secret of their extraordinary success each in his own right and it lay precisely in that insatiable curiosity that irrepressible desire to know no matter what the subject no matter what the cost even at a time when the keepers of the doomsday clock are willing to bet even this is what i'm passionate about it is precisely this it is this undaunted appetite for learning and experience no matter how risible no matter how esoteric no matter how seditious it might seem this defines the imagined futures of our fellow hungarians robicsek and teszler and bartok as it does my own as it does i suspect that of everybody here to which i need only add this is our task we know it will be hard it seems to me that this hungarian presence in my life is difficult to account for but ultimately i ascribe it to an admiration for people with a complex moral awareness with a heritage of guilt and defeat matched by defiance and bravado it's not a typical mindset for most americans but it is perforce typical of virtually all hungarians so yo napot i went back to south carolina after some fifteen years amid the alien corn at the tail end of the nineteen sixties with the reckless condescension of that era thinking i would save my people napot pacak which as somebody here must surely know means what 's up guys in magyar that peculiar never mind the fact that they were slow to acknowledge they needed saving i labored in that vineyard for a quarter century before i knew nothing about wofford and even less about methodism but i was reassured on the first day that i taught at wofford college to find among the auditors in my classroom a ninety year old hungarian he was a puckish widower whose wife and children were dead and whose grandchildren lived far away in appearance he resembled mahatma gandhi minus the loincloth plus orthopedic boots he was ostracized as a child not because he was a jew his parents weren't very religious anyhow but because he had been born with two club feet a condition which in those days required institutionalization and a succession of painful operations between the ages of one and eleven he went to the commercial business high school as a young man in budapest and there he was as smart as he was modest and he enjoyed a considerable success and after graduation when he went into textile engineering non indo european language spoken by hungarians for which given the fact that cognitive diversity is at least as threatened as biodiversity on this planet the success continued he built one plant after another he married and had two sons he had friends in high places who assured him that he was of great value to the economy he had left instructions to have done he was summoned in the middle of the night by the night watchman at one of his plants but why do you steal from me if you need money you have only to ask the night watchman seeing how things were going and waxing indignant said well we're going to call well maybe he was too trusting because he stayed where he was long after the nazi anschluss in austria and even after the arrests and deportations began in budapest he took the simple precaution of having cyanide capsules placed in lockets that could be worn about the necks of himself and his family but none who entered that death house had ever come out alive and in a twist you would not believe in a steven spielberg film few would have imagined much of a future even a century or two ago but there it is the gauleiter who was overseeing this brutal beating was the very same thief who had stolen socks from mister teszler 's hosiery mill it was a brutal beating and midway through and whispered into mister teszler 's ear no do not take the capsule help is on the way and then resumed the beating but help help was on the way and shortly afterward a car arrived from the swiss embassy they were spirited to safety they were reclassified as yugoslav citizens and they managed to stay one step ahead of their pursuers for the duration of the war surviving burnings and bombings and at the end of the war arrest by the soviets i said somebody here must surely know because despite the fact that there aren't that many hungarians to begin with and the further fact that so far as i know there's not a drop of hungarian blood and then to the center of the textile industry in the american south which as chance would have it was spartanburg south carolina the location of wofford college and there mister teszler began all over again and once again achieved immense success especially after he invented a process for manufacturing a new fabric called double knit and then then in the late nineteen fifties in the aftermath of brown versus board of education when the klan was resurgent all over the south mister teszler said i have heard this talk before and he called his top assistant to him and asked where would you say in this region he was told and shortly afterwards mister teszler received a visit from the white mayor of kings mountain now you should know that at that time the textile industry in the south was notoriously segregated he also received a visit from the leader of the black community a minister who said mister teszler i sure hope you're going to hire some black workers for this new plant of yours he got the same answer you bring the best workers you can find and if they are good enough i will hire them as it happens the black minister did his job better than the white mayor but that's neither here or there misterteszler hired sixteen eight white eight black they were to be his seed group his future foremen he had installed the heavy equipment for his new process in an abandoned store in the vicinity of kings mountain and for two months these sixteen men would live and work together mastering the new process at every critical juncture of my life there has been a hungarian friend or mentor there beside me i even have dreams that take place in landscapes he gathered them together after an initial tour of the facility and asked if there were any questions there was hemming and hawing and shuffling of feet and then one of the white workers stepped forward and said well yeah this place and there's only one place to sleep there's only one place to eat there's only one bathroom is this plant going to be integrated or what two months later when the main plant opened and hundreds of new workers white and black poured in to see the facility for the first time they were met by the sixteen foremen white and black standing shoulder to shoulder the facility and were asked if there were any questions and inevitably the same question arose is this plant integrated or what one of the white foremen stepped you are being paid twice the wages of any other workers in this industry in this region and this is how we do business do you have any other and there were none in one fell swoop mister teszler had integrated the textile industry in that part of the south it was an achievement worthy of mahatma gandhi conducted with the shrewdness of a lawyer and the idealism of a saint his eighties mister teszler having retired from the textile industry adopted wofford college auditing courses every semester and because he had a tendency to kiss anything that moved becoming affectionately known as opi which is as the landscapes of hungarian films especially the early movies of miklos jancso so the faculty decided to honor itself by naming mister teszler professor of the college partly because at that point he had already taken all of the courses of the catalog but mainly he was so wiser than any one of us to me it was immensely reassuring that the presiding spirit of this little methodist college in upstate south carolina was a holocaust survivor from central europe he was indeed but he also had a wonderful sense of humor and once for an interdisciplinary class i was screening the opening segment of ingmar bergman 's the seventh seal as the medieval knight antonius blok returned from the wild goose chase of the crusades and arrived on the rocky shore of sweden only to find the specter of death waiting for him how do i explain this mysterious affinity maybe it's because my native state of south carolina mister teszler sat in the dark with his fellow students and as death opened his cloak to embrace the knight in a ghastly embrace i heard mister teszler 's but it was music that was his greatest passion especially opera and on the first occasion that i visited his house he gave me honor of deciding what piece of music we would listen to and i delighted him by rejecting cavalerria rusticana in favor of bela bartok 's bluebeard 's castle i love bartok 's music as did mister teszler and he had virtually every recording of bartok 's music ever issued and it was at his house that i heard for the first time bartok 's third piano concerto and learned from mister teszler that it had been composed in nearby asheville north carolina in the last year of the composer 's life he was dying of leukemia and he knew it and he dedicated this concerto to his wife dita who was herself a concert pianist and into the slow second movement marked adagio religioso he incorporated the sounds of birdsong that he heard outside his window in what he knew would be his last spring he was imagining a future which is not much smaller than present day hungary once imagined a future for itself as an independent country and as a consequence of that presumption my hometown was burned to the ground by an invading army for her in which he would play no part and clearly clearly this composition is his final statement to to her it was first performed after his death and through her to the world and just as clearly it is saying whenever you hear this it was only after mister teszler 's death that i learned that the marker on the grave of bela bartok in hartsdale new york was paid for by not long before mister teszler a s own death at the age of ninety seven he heard me hold forth on human iniquity i delivered a lecture in which i described history as on the whole a tidal wave of human suffering you human beings are fundamentally good and i made a vow to myself then and there that if this man who had such cause to think otherwise had reached that conclusion i would not presume to differ until he released me from my vow and now he 's dead so i'm stuck with my vow yo napot i thought my skein of hungarian mentors had come to an end but almost immediately i met francis robicsek a hungarian doctor actually a heart surgeon in charlotte north carolina then in his late seventies who had been a pioneer in open heart surgery and tinkering away in his garage behind his house had invented many of the devices that are standard parts of those procedures he 's also a prodigious art collector beginning as an intern in budapest by collecting sixteenth and seventeenth century dutch art and hungarian painting and when he came to this country moving on to spanish colonial art russian icons and finally an experience that has befallen many a hungarian town and village throughout its long and troubled history or maybe it's because when i was a teenager back in the fifties my uncle henry mayan ceramics he 's the author of seven books six of them on mayan ceramics it was he who broke the mayan codex enabling scholars to relate the pictographs on mayan ceramics to the hieroglyphs of the mayan script and doctor robicsek said with obvious pride now for the piece de resistance and he opened the door and we walked into a windowless twenty by twenty foot room with shelves from floor to ceiling and crammed on every shelf his collection of mayan ceramics now i know absolutely nothing about mayan ceramics but i wanted to be as ingratiating as possible so i said but doctor this is absolutely dazzling yes he said that is what the louvre said they would not leave me alone until i let them have a piece but it was not a good one well it occurred to me that i should invite doctor robicsek to lecture at wofford college on what else leonardo da vinci and further i should invite him to meet my oldest trustee who had majored in french history at yale some seventy odd years before and at eighty nine the world 's largest privately owned textile empire with an iron hand his name is roger milliken and milliken agreed and doctor robicsek agreed and doctor robicsek visited and delivered the lecture and it was a dazzling success and afterwards we convened at the president 's house with doctor robicsek on one hand mister milliken on the other and it was only at that moment as we were sitting down to dinner that i recognized the enormity of the risk i had created because to bring these two titans these two masters of the universe together having denounced the ku klux klan and having been bombed for his trouble and had crosses burned in his yard living under death threat took his wife and children to massachusetts for safety and went back to south carolina to,1,"yeah I know Pata Pata which is somebody here must surely know means what's up guys and Monday are that are non Indo-European language spoken by hungarians for which given the fact that cognitive diversity is at least has threatened to biodiversity on this planet who would have imagined much of a future even a century or two ago but there it is. I said somebody here must surely know because despite the fact that there aren't that many hungarians to begin with and the further fact that so far as I know there's not a drop of Hungarian blood in my veins at every critical juncture of my life there has been a Hungarian friend on Mentor the other side may even have dreams that take place in Landscapes I recognized as the Landscapes especially the early movies of Nicolas on so so how do I explain this mysterious maybe it's because my name is state of South Carolina. not much smaller than present a hungry once imagined the future for itself as an independent country and is a consequence of that presumption my home town was burned To The Ground by the invading Army an experience that has befallen many of Hungarian town and Village throughout its long and troubled history maybe it's because when I was a teenager the Ku Klux Klan and Ben bomb for his trouble in that crosses burned in this yard living on the death threat took his wife and children to Massachusetts for safety and went back to South Carolina to face down to clown alone with a very Hungarian thing to do as anyone will attest to remembers 1956 and of course from time-to-time hungarians have invented their own equivalent of the clan. well it seems to me that this Hungarian presence in my life is difficult to account for But ultimately I ascribe it to an option for people with a complex moral awareness with the heritage of guilt and Deceit by the science and bravado hits not a typical mindset for most Americans but it is perforce typical of virtually all hungarians. Pasic. I went back to South Carolina after some 15 years amid the alien con it's a tail end of the 1960s I'm never mind the fact that they were slow to acknowledge they needed safe and I'll leave it in that venue in for a quarter-century before making my way to a little kingdom with the Justin upstate South Carolina off of this Affiliated institution of Higher Learning called Wofford College I knew nothing about golfing and even less about nothing but I was reassured on the first day of thought I thought it was in college to find among the Auditors in my classroom a 90 year old Hungarian surrounded by a bevy of middle-aged European women who seem to function as an Entourage of Tesla. he was a package with a war whose wife and children with Dad, he's grandchildren's lives far away and apparently she resembled Mahatma Gandhi minus the loincloth plus Orthopedic boots have been born in 1903 in the Providence is the old austro-hungarian Empire he was a Jew his parents weren't very religious anyhow because he'd been born with two club feet a condition which in those days required institutionalization and a succession of painful operations between the ages of 1 and 11 Commercial Business High School in Budapest he was as smart as he was modest and he enjoyed considerable success enough to graduation when he wanted to textile engineering the success continues he built one planet after another and had two sons he had friends in high places to assure him that he was of Great Value to the economy. once that he had left instructions to have fun he was someone in the middle of the night by the nightwatchman it one of his plans the night Watchman had called an employee who was stealing socks it was a truck up to the loading dock in the shoveling in mountains that sucks I miss the Tesla went down to the plant and confronted the thief and said what why do you steal from me it's you need money you have only to ask the night Watchman seeing how things were going and waxing and Denison. but maybe he was too trusting because he stayed where he was long after the Nazi on sluice in Austria and even after the arrests and deportations began in Budapest he took the simple precaution of having cyanide capsules play Stan lockets that could be one about the next of himself and his family and then one day it happened he and his family were arrested and they would take him to a death house on the Danube in those early days of the final solution it was handcrafted politics people were beaten to death in their bodies tossed into the river but none who could ever come out of a Twist you would not believe in a Steven Spielberg film the gal like her who was overseeing this brutal beatings the very same Thief who had stolen Sox from the Tesla Toy Story now. it was a brutal beating and Midway through that brutality one of Mr Tesla's Sons Andrew looked up and said is it time to take the capsule now Papa. I'm the gal I know who after was banished from this story leaned down and whispered into miss the Tesla's hear no do not take the Caps to help is on the way and then resume the beating but help help was on the way in shortly afterwards a car arrived from the Swiss Embassy they were spirited to safety they were reclassified as you can sloths citizens and they managed to stay one step ahead of their pursuers for the duration of the war surviving burnings and bombings and at the end of The Walrus by the Soviets. probably missed a Tesla have gotten some money in the Swiss bank account because he managed to take his family first the Great Britain been to Long Island and then to the sun over the textile industry in the American South which is chance would have it with Spartanburg South Carolina the location of Wallace of college and mr. Tesla began all over again and once again achieved immense success especially after he invented a process for manufacturing a new fabric called double knit and then then in the late 1950s in the aftermath of Brown versus Board of Education in the clan was Resurgence all over the South mr. Tesla said I have heard this talk before. and he called his top assistant to him and ask where would you stay in this region racism is most virulent well I don't rightly know missed a good buy us some land in Kings Mountain and announce we are going to build a major plan to Kings Mountain now you should know that at that time the textile industry in the South was notoriously segregated the white man will be hiring a lot of white workers mr. Tesla told him you bring me the best workers that you can sign them. he also received a visit from the leader of the black community a minister who said Mr Tesla show hope you're going to hire some black workers for this new plant of yours he got the same answer you bring me the best workers that you can find how do you say I'm good enough I will fire them as it happens to an 8 by 8 black they were to be his future Foreman he had installed a heavy equipment for his new process in an abandoned store in the vicinity of Kings Mountain and the two months these sixteen men would live and work together mastering the new process. he gathered them together after the initial to of that facility and he asked if there were any questions that was hemming and hawing a shuffling of feet and then one of the white workers step forward and said well yeah and there's only one place to sleep is only one place to eat is only one bathroom is only one water fountain is this plant going to be it look rated or what you said you were being paid twice the wages of any other textile workers in this region and this is how we do business do you have any other questions and two months later when the main plant open and hundreds of new workers white and black pulled him to see the facility for the first time they were met by the 16 Foreman white and black standing shoulder-to-shoulder they toured the facility and when asked if there were any questions and inevitably the same question arose is this plant emigrated or what and one of the white woman stepped forward and said you are being paid Christ. any other workers in this industry in this region and this is how we do business do you have any other questions and there were none in one Fell Swoop with the Tesla patents granted the textile industry in that part of the South it was an achievement worthy of Mahatma Gandhi conducted with the shrewdness of a lawyer and the idealism of a saint. in his eighties mr. Tesla having retired from the textile industry adopted Walford College or anything becoming a function that they known as opiates which is Monday at 4 grandfather by all and Sundry before I got to the library after I arrived in 1993 The Faculty decided to honor Itself by a professor of the college partly because at that point he had already taken all of the courses in the catalog but mainly because he was so conspicuously wiser than any one of us. give me it was immensely reassuring that the presiding Spirit of this little Methodist College in upstate South Carolina was a holocaust Survivor from Central Europe. why is he wasn't anybody else with that wonderful sense of humor and what's for an interdisciplinary class I was screening the opening segment of in my bergman's the seventh seal is the medieval Knight Antonius block return from the wild goose chase of the Crusades and arrives on the rocky shores Sweden only to find the Specter of death waiting for him Mister Tesla sat in the dock with his fellow students opened his cloak to embrace the night in the ghastly Embrace I heard Mr Tesla's tremulous voice he said. but it was music that was his greatest passion especially Opera tuhan I deleted him by rejecting cavalera Rusticana in favor of Bela Bartok bluebeard's Castle I love Bops music has stood mr. tessland and he had virtually every recording faucets music ever issued and it was at his house that I heard for the first time but talks third piano concerto and learn from this the Tesla that it has been composed and thereby Asheville North Carolina in the last year of the compose his life he was dying of Leukemia and he knew it into the slow second movement mocked Adagio religioso Incorporated the sounds of birds song that he heard outside is ones and what he knew would be his last spring he was imagining. future for her in which he would play no pot and clearly clearly this composition is his final statement to her was first performed after his death and threw her to the world and Justice clearly it is saying it's okay it was all so beautiful whenever you hear this I will be there. it was only after Mr Tesla's death that I learned that the marker on the grave of Bela Bartok in Hartsdale New York was paid for by sounds of a Tesla yellow Park Mala. not long before the test was on death at the age of 97 he heard me hold forth on human iniquity I delivered election which describes history is his own the whole lot of human suffering and brutality and came up to me afterwards with jumps will reproach and said you know doctor human beings fundamentally good. and I made a vow to myself then and there that if this man who had such cause to think otherwise had reached that conclusion I would not presume to defer until he released me from My Vow and now he's dead so I'm stuck with my Val. yellow pot shop door. I thought Mustaine of Hungarian mentors it come to an end but almost immediately Francis robichek in Charlotte North Carolina then in this late 70s with been a Pioneer in open heart surgery and thinking and tinkering Away in his garage behind his house had invented many of the devices that are found in parts of those procedures he's also a prodigious art collector beginning as an intern and Budapest by collecting 16th and 17th century Dutch oven Hungarian painting and when it came to this country moving on to Spanish Colonial off the Russian icons and and finally Mayan Ceramics he's the author of seven books six of them on my own ceramics it was he who broke the Mayan codex and Scholars to relates the pictographs on my end ceramic to the hieroglyphs of the Mayan script on the occasion of my first visit. then we paused in front of a clothes store and back of his head with obvious Pride now for the pas de resistance and he open the door and he walked into a windowless 20 x 20 room with shells from floor to ceiling and crowns on every shelf his collection of my on ceramic nothing about my own ceramics but I wanted to be as ingratiating as possible so I said I would check this is absolutely dazzling she said she said they would not leave me alone. well it occurred to me that I should invite the robichek to lecture at Wofford College on what else did Leonardo da Vinci and further I should invite him to meet my oldest trustee who would majored in French history at Yale some seventy years before and at 89 still rules the world's largest privately-owned textile Empire with an iron hand by his name is Rodger Milliken I managed to Milliken agreed and I agreed and visited and success and afterwards we convened at the president's house. The robot check on one hand but the Milliken on the other and it was only at that moment as we were sitting down to dinner that I recognize the enormity of the risk I had created to bring these to tie these two Masters of the Universe together. it was like introducing mockler the Godzilla over the skyline of Tokyo if they didn't like each other we could all get trampled to death but they did they didn't like each other they got along famously and then they got into a furious argument and what they were arguing about was this. what was the second Harry Potter movie was As Good As the First. listen to work and said it was not talked to Robert check this agreed I was still trying to take in the notion that these Titans these Masters of the Universe and that's about time watch Harry Potter movies when he was in the argument by saying you just think it's so good because you didn't read the book and talked to Robert check real back in his chair but quickly that is with lean forward in the movie with a grandchild yes I did conceive all by myself. and I realized in this moment of Revelation that these two men were reviewing what's the secret of that insatiable curiosity that irrepressible desire to know no matter what the subject willing to bet even money that the human race won't be around to imagine anything in the year 2193 years from now live each day as if it is your last that Mahatma Gandhi learn if you'll live forever this is what I am passionate about it is precisely this it is this. and extinguish about undaunted appetite for Learning and an experienced no matter how it might seem this defines the imagined futures of our fellow hungarians robichek Tesla and bought a book as it does my own as it does not suspect that this everybody here to which I need only add they sent me Moon conch its name is Candice this is our task we know it will be hot.traffic is a global epidemic traffic is creating 45% of the world's air pollution in the UK time wasted in traffic cost 20 billion a year would you pay for clean the name of the Falls to commute Stockholm put it to a vote. how to do something install come to improve the environment to end to get the better of a flow in the traffic will put a price on taking your car into the center post office, and we called that congestion charges. if you stop a system like this and it doesn't work on the first day then you will be in big trouble if not the perfect from Davon. there are teaching them tickets to the city each is equipped with cameras pictures of taking all the rear and front license plates these pictures are sent to Central system that identifies the license plates and make sure that the right person pays for the right passages to read the license plate we went out IBM's Global organization and the R&D centres and find a very good software we could use a weight management Limited in two months time going to 9% of old pictures are correct identified. nice guys this is how it should be all the time you go see the traffic of the truck is 6 p.m. before we have the congestion charge in the traffic was chewing up at this time of day it is I think it's a good idea because I think that we should it take care of the environments in the CD was about fourteen percent better that is huge International interest from different parts of the world from the United States from Latin America from China and its really pretty sure to tell people no proper planning to do what we're actually have done install come she is not thinking like me for. the future I'm thinking for the children and their grandchildren.",0.7252603769302368,
46,BenKatchor_2002.sph.wav,come from is is simply the byproduct of a crude mechanical action or is it an imitation of one half a set of sounds we make to express disappointment the often dedental consonant of no indo european language or is it the amplified sound of a synapse firing in the brain of a cockroach in the nineteen fifties they tried their best to muffle this sound with mercury switches and silent knob controls but today these improvements seem somehow inauthentic the click is the modern triumphal clarion proceeding us through life announcing our entry into every lightless room the sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature i'm going to read a few strips these are most of these are from a monthly page i do in and architecture and design magazine it has a deep melancholy ring children don't like it it's why they leave lights on around the house adults find it comforting but wouldn't it be an easy matter to wire a wall switch so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship or the recorded crowing of a rooster the distant peel of thunder thomas edison went through thousands of unlikely substances before he came upon the right one for the filament of his electric lightbulb why have we settled so quickly for the sound of its switch that's the end praise of the taxpayer that so many of the city 's most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom is cause for celebration these one or two story structures designed to yield only enough income to cover the taxes on the land on which they stand were not meant to be permanent buildings yet for one reason or another they have confounded the efforts of developers to be combined into lots suitable for high rise construction although they make no claim to architectural beauty they are in their perfect temporariness a delightful alternative to the large scale structures that might someday take their place called metropolis and the first story is called the faulty switch another beautifully designed new building ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch the most perfect examples occupy corner lots they offer a pleasant respite from the high density development around them a break of light and air an architectural biding of time so buried in signage are these structures that it often takes a moment to distinguish the modern specially constructed taxpayer from its neighbor the small commercial building from an earlier century whose upper floors have been sealed and whose groundfloor space now functions as a taxpayer the few surfaces not covered by signs are often clad in a distinctive dark green gray striated aluminum siding take out sandwich shops film processing drop offs peep shows and necktie stores now these provisional structures have in some cases remained standing for the better part of a human lifetime the temporary building is a triumph of modern industrial organization a healthy sublimation of the urge to build and proof that not every architectural idea need be set in stone that's the end the lap was a platform upon which to place the earthly possessions of the dead thirty cubits from foot to knee it was not until the fourteenth century that an italian painter recognized the lap as a grecian temple upholstered in flesh and cloth over the next two hundred years we see the infant christ go

school again this morning the ventriloquist must first make us believe that a small boy is sitting on his lap the illusion of speech follows incidentally what have you got to say for yourself jimmy as adults we admire the lap from a nostalgic distance we have fading memories of that provisional temple erected each time an adult sat down on a crowded bus there was always a to sit children and teenage girls who are most keenly aware of its architectural beauty they understand the structural integrity of a deep avuncular lap as compared to the shaky arangement of a neurotic niece in high heels the relationship between the lap and its owner is direct and intimate i envision a thirty six story four hundred and fifty unit residential high a reason to consider the mental health of any architect before granting an important commission the bathrooms and kitchens will of course have no windows the lap of luxury is an architectural construct of childhood which we seek in vain as adults to employ that's the end the hundreds of hours designing the burnished brass switchplates serves as the temporary resting place for the haverpiece collection of european dried fruit the profound convolutions on the surface of a dried cherry the foreboding sheen of an extra large date do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries where everything was displayed in poorly labeled roach proof bins pears dried in the form of genital organs for his new office tower and then left it to a contractor to install these seventy nine cent switches behind them

to read a few strips of these are most of these are from a monthly page I doing an architecture & Design magazine called Metropolis in the first story is called the faulty switch another beautifully designed the new building ruin the by the sound of a common wall light switch it's fine during the day when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight but at dusk Everything Changes the architect spent hundreds of hours designing a burnished brass switch plates for his new office tower and then left it to a contractor to install the $0.79 which is behind them we know instinctively where to reach when we enter a dark room we automatically throat. little knob of plastic upward but the sound we are greeted with as the room is bathed in the simulated glow of late afternoon light record to mind a dirty men's room in the rear of a Greek coffee shop. this sound color is a first impression of any room it can't be helped but where does this sound commonly described as a click come from is it simply the byproduct of a crude mechanical action or is it an imitation of one half the set of sounds we make to express disappointment the orphan the dental consonant have no Indo-European language or is it the Amplified sound of a synapse firing in the brain of a cockroach. in the 1950s they tried their best to muffle this sound with Mercury switches and silent and knob controls but today is improvements seems somehow inauthentic with click is the modern triumphal Clarion proceeding us through life announcing our entry into every lightless room the sound of made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature it has a deep Melancholy ring. children don't like it is why they leave lights on around the house that'll find it comforting but wouldn't it be an easy matter to wire a wall switch so that it triggers the muted Horn of a steamship or the recorded crowing of a rooster. all the distant peel of thunder.

47,BenSaunders_2005.sph.wav,and scott the british guy captain scott scott had sort of ponies and some tractors and a few dogs all of which went wrong and scott and his team of four people ended up on foot i have a school report i was thirteen years old and it's framed above my desk at home it says ben lacks sufficient impetus to achieve anything we started running very low on food we were both pretty hungry losing lots of weight some very unusual weather conditions very difficult ice conditions we had decidedly low tech communications we couldn't afford a satellite phone so we had hf radio you can see two ski poles sticking out of the a wire dangling down either side that was our hf radio antenna we had less than two hours two way communication with the outside world in two months we spoke to the russian helicopter pilots on the radio and they said look boys you've run out of time we've got to pick you up and i felt that i had of this expedition and i got back to heathrow my mum was there my brother was there my granddad was there had in a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition and lying on my mum 's sofa day in day out watching daytime tv one and a half times the size of america five and a half thousand square miles more than two thousand people have climbed everest twelve people have stood on the moon including me only four people have skied solo to the north pole and i think the reason for that my brother sent me a text message an sms it's it was a quote from the simpsons it said you tried your hardest and failed miserably the lesson is don't even try three years i did eventually get off the sofa and start planning another expedition this time i wanted to go right across on my own this time from russia at the top of the map reason this was what i wanted to have a crack at but i knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece let alone make it across to canada i had to take a radical approach and the expedition started in february last year big support team we had a film crew a couple of logistics people with us the next bit we'd chartered a pretty elderly russian plane to fly us up to a town called khatanga which was the sort of last bit of civilization we got to khatanga i think the joke is that khatanga isn't the end of the world but you can see it from loaded up the helicopters two helicopters flying in tandem dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice to make things worse you can just see the white dot up at the top right hand side of the screen that's a full moon because we'd been held up in russia of course the full moon brings the highest and lowest tides thank you i think the reason for that is that it's it's well it's as chris said bonkers it's a journey that is right at the limit of human i didn't have a hope in hell i had to pull one leave it and go back and get the other one literally scrambling through what's called pressure ice the ice had been my record was minus two point five miles i got up in the morning took the tent down skied north for seven and a half hours put the tent up and i was two and a half miles further back than when i'd started i literally couldn't keep up with the drift of the ice just appalling oh drifted back about five miles in the last last later in the expedition the problem was no longer the ice it was it also meant if the worst came to the worst i could actually jump in and swim across and drag the sledge over after me some pretty radical technology a radical approach but it worked perfectly another exciting thing we did last year was with communications technology as dangerous as everest it wasn't all high tech this is navigating in what's called a whiteout when you get lots of mist low cloud the wind starts blowing the snow up you i got to the pole on the eleventh of may it took me sixty eight days to get there from russia and there is nothing there there isn't even a pole at the pole there's nothing there purely because it's sea ice it's drifting stick a flag there leave it there pretty soon it will drift off usually towards canada or greenland i knew this but i was expecting something that sat down on my sledge did a sort of video diary piece took a few photos i got my satellite phone out i warmed the battery up in my armpit i dialed three numbers i dialed my mum i dialed my girlfriend i dialed the ceo of my sponsor and i got three the entire planet is rotating beneath my feet the the whole world i finally got through to my mum she was at the queue of the supermarket she started crying i skied on for a week past the pole i wanted to get as close to canada as i could before conditions just got too dangerous to continue this was the last day i had on the ice when i spoke to the my project management team they said look ben conditions are getting too dangerous there are huge areas of open water just south of your position we'd like to pick you up ben could you please look for an airstrip this was the view outside my tent when i had this fateful phone call find it took me thirty six hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip was exactly four hundred and seventy three meters i could measure it with my skis i didn't tell tony that i didn't tell the pilots that i thought it'll have to do it just about worked a pretty dramatic landing the plane actually passed over four times and i was a bit worried it wasn't going to land at all the pilot i knew was called troy i was expecting someone called troy that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy i was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed troy troy was smoking a cigarette on the ice we took a few photos he climbed up the ladder he said just just get in the back he threw his cigarette out as he got on the front and i climbed in the back his i thought god here we go we 're we're this is all or nothing rammed it forwards bounced down the runway just took off one of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge i could see into the cockpit troy battling the controls and he just took one hand off reached back flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit and it was the fasten seat belt sign you can in the traditional sense i'm not skiing along drawing maps everyone knows where the north pole is at the south pole there's a big scientific base there's an airstrip there's a cafe for me this is about exploring human limits about exploring the limits of physiology of psychology and of technology they're the things that excite me scratching the surface of their potential just doing three or four or five percent of what they're truly capable of so on a wider scale i hope that this journey was a chance to inspire other people to think about what they want to do with their potential and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time we each have on this planet the last question what's next as quickly as possible if i have a minute left at the end i'll go into more detail what's next the coldest highest windiest and driest continent on earth,1,"this is my mother's been told I specialize in dragging heavy things around cold places on May 11th last year I stood alone at the North in an area one and a half times the size of America fighting with a thousand square miles Everest 12 people stole the moon including me only four people have skied so go to the North Pole and I think the reason for that. thank you I think the reason for that is that it's it's it's it's is Chrisette Bonkers it's a journey that is is a human capability of 31 back-to-back 800 miles in 10 weeks and I was dragging the food I needed the supplies the equipment sleeping bag one change of on the way to everything I needed three months. what are you trying to spend I've read somewhere that has 40 Exposed Skin becomes less than a minute so. are you started back in 2001 my first expedition was with a guy who pain headache and no mistake. This is like my my polar apprenticeship we were trying to ski from this group of islands to the North Pole and the list of the floating skin of ice on the oxidation what I've let myself in for I was trying for years old I know when my agent that attempted is a nice and pretty quickly almost everything that could go wrong did go wrong we were attacked by a day to trust we started running right on food we buy pretty hungry. we had a decidedly low-tech Communications we couldn't afford the satellite phones we have HF HF radio antenna we have less than two hours to a communication with the outside world in two months ultimately we run 20 miles left to go to the pole and we've run out of time we were too late in the Summer sun to melt respect Sebastian and they said I felt that I had failed I'm wholeheartedly I I was a failure the one that goes one dream I've had for as long as I can remember I haven't even come close to the video clips that I died replay I've never been in my mind when the going got tough just to keep my keep my motivation guy the first one was. reaching the pole itself I could see it vividly I suppose being filmed out of the door I had a couple music playing in the background zaida a ski pole with a Union Jack Royce my music going to reach you for sending the second video clip that I imagined was getting back to Heathrow Airport and I can see again vividly that I see the autograph Hunters the book agents coming to sign up for deal and of course neither of these things happened we didn't get the pole and we didn't have any money to pay wants to pee also know what I've heard of this Expedition my brother was my granddad was a Jack and that was about it I was physically exhausted mentally and resulted in huge amount of debt and daytime TV. my brother sent me a text message SMS from The Simpsons it said you tried your hardest and failed miserably the lesson is don't even try. fast for 3 days I did eventually get off the sofa and and start planning a Expedition this time I want to get right across on my in the Sun from Russia told the map to the North Pole where they should have came to the Middle East and then on to Canada no one has made a complete crossing without station on their own to to Norwegian to do as a team in 2095 and he was rescued after a week he he described this Expedition has 10 times as dangerous as Everest so if for some reason this was on you that seem to stand a chance of getting hungry one piece let's make it across the kind of approach. this might have been perfecting the song off sub 2 G toothbrush to working with world's leading nutritionist in in developing a completely new revolutionary nutritional from scratch $6,000 a day. and I'm starting in February of big support team at a film crew a couple of logistics people with my girlfriend to to Moscow the next in Siberia to Cross Plains flies up to a Tango Tango which was the last bit of civilization Russian pilot completed at time to fly to six hours if we live. we we got sick at Angela I think the joke is that the katanga isn't the end of the world but you can see it from there it was supposed to be an overnight stay we were 10 days does vodka fuel pay dispute between the helicopter Pilots died in the helicopter say we would stop we can drop me off the edge of paradise are we had a friend takes her to 45 minutes of filming photography while I had to go to a still there I didn't run into him by phone and then climbed back into the house and I was alone.to make things worse you can just see that the brightness of the screen that's a Full Moon because we've been held up in Russia at the full moon brings the highest and lowest Tides when you're standing on the on the Frozen surface of the sea high-low Tides generally mean the interesting things are going to happen unless you can start moving out of it I wish you can see that. So much exactly four hundred pounds when the ice was flat or flat day so I could just about full bass when the ice wasn't flat I didn't even have I had to put one leave it smashed up under the pressure of the currents the oceans of the wind the tides. NASA discovered the ice conditions are she has the worst since records began. I just always drifting apart cuz is away starting I was skiing at the headwinds for 9 out of 10 weeks I was a lying lost it and I was tripping backwards most the time my record is -2.5 MI in the morning to set down the ski house put the tent up for the back the one I still couldn't keep up with the drift of the ice. 6322 lionshead getting ready to Gabe the boiler it's just a cooling rack about the lost last night on a secret weapon up my sleeve this is my little bit of biomimicry mean no way I'm based on a survival suit I paid over a very thin ice and if I fell asleep wasn't in the world it will swim across and drag besides Ava off to me. free radical technology. in 1912 shackleton's endurance Expedition that was one of his crew the explorers of 2012 if there's any left to explore Wireless telephones fitted with Wallace telescopes Strong by by eight years this is my wallet and every single day of the 72 days I was letting you know I was blocking life my tent sending back a little piece sending back information on the distance I covered the ice conditions of temperature and we had less than 2 hours radio contact the outside world lost you blocking life a French person has been described as 10 times as dangerous as a rest was no high-tech this is navigation in what school do y sounds when you get lots of mist low Cloud the wind starts blowing snot Yellow Ribbon. navigate using the direction of the wind so I'm weird combination of high-tech and low-tech from Russia and there is nothing there is there is there isn't even a Poulan pole there's nothing there something strange with your feelings it was extremely warm by the stage a lot of commotion around and elated that I started to 22 really realize that my chances are make it all way across the kind of which you're so fond of miles away was slim at best. are there any proof that I was terrified of that video. My mom I do my girlfriend. Tell the Sea of my phones and I got three. voicemails nicey. this is a special feeling. the entire planet is the rotating beneath my feet. there's a whole world underneath me. I see them for this was the last day I have the ice conditions that are getting too dangerous there huge as like more than just south of your position we'd like to pick you up then could you please look for an airstrip outside my tent when I went to have this this fateful Finkel I never tried to build a strip before attorney there somebody he said that when you go to find 500 find 36 hours of sitting around trying to find a nice trip with exactly four hundred and seventy-three M I can measure it with white with my skis I didn't tell Tony that I didn't tell the pilots.. oh oh oh oh. it just about what's pretty dramatic Landing the plane that she posted it four times. I was a bit worried it was going to land the two of the stuff I was pulling my plane landed the plane. the co-pilot was a lady for money cuz she was out there instead of having to jump the least Metro people I've ever met but he threw a cigarette. text Jeff Meldrum a few times to flatten out already I'm going to get it to go on the roof of the plateau pressure Ridge and thank you I can see into the cockpit controls I just flipped the switch on the seat belt sign you can see on the on the hill. show me how to break up why I kind of an Explorer in the traditional sense. I'm not staying long drawing Maps everyone knows where the North Pole is at the South Pole there's a big scientific-based is an airstrip is a cafe and is a Taurus SHO for me this is about destroying human limits about exploring the limits of physiology of psychology and of technology that this film is a chance to to to explore the limits really push the limits of Miami Central see how far they stretch that potential just doing three or four or five percent of what they are truly capable of so other people to think about. what they want some of that potential I want they want you to the tiny amount of time we each have on this planet that's as close as I can come to some of the next question is how do you spell TV on Sir of course to which cheese is a trade secret and at what temp what's next Antarctica the coldest highest windiest and driest continent on Earth late 1911 early 1912 there's a race to be the first to the South Pole they the Hollis identity comes from France and talks to conclude the eyeshadows is twice the size of Australia is a big place. Scott had to some ponies and some tractors in a few dogs or which went wrong and I'm Scott and his team of four people ended up on foot they got to find a Norwegian flag already there there's a tent unless it's a Norwegian King and they turned around and headed back to Coast on the return Journey since then no one has ever see this is 93 years ago since I haven't skied from the cast on Tosca to the pole and back every South Pole electrician email about is either flown out for the pole or used vehicles or B to do something no one's ever made a return Jenny say that's the plan was doing it and I meant to scan is not forgotten but I have a I have a school report out of setting is out and it's it is framed about my desk at home it says Ben lacks sufficient impetus to achieve anything worth.

48,BenjaminWallace_2008P.sph.wav,eminent and accomplished figures in the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles i think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world i became with the generous backing of a magazine i write for sometimes i decided to sample the very best or most expensive or most coveted item in about a dozen categories which was a very grueling quest as you to play a brief video clip for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them so that's why you're going to see this recurring character which i guess you know communicates to you that i did not think that one was really worth the white truffles one of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world to try this i went to a mario batali restaurant in manhattan del posto the waiter you know came out with the white truffle knob and his shaver and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said you know would signore like the truffles and the charm of white truffles is in their aroma it's not in their taste really it's not in their texture it's in the smell these white that you know their purpose had been served and so i'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me there were several several of these items were disappointments this is soap that's made from silver nanoparticles which have antibacterial properties i washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this and it you know tickled a little bit and it smelled good but i have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness then again nobody has complimented me on the these ones gq did spring for i own these but i will tell you not only did i not get a compliment from any of you i have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that i have owned and i don't think that whether or not you're getting a compliment should be the test of something 's value but i think in the case of a fashion item an article of clothing that's a reasonable benchmark that said a lot of work goes into these they are made from handpicked organic zimbabwean cotton that has been

enthusiastic wine buffs of the eighteenth century oxygen and light he uses tiny bottles the glass is tinted he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas and he actually once he releases a batch of it he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online so you can go online it tasted fine it tasted interesting it was very green it was very peppery but in the blind taste test it came in last which had been oxidizing next to my stove for six months a recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from japan you'll start to notice i don't play golf so i couldn't actually road test these but i did interview a guy who owns them even the people who market these clubs these have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed and thereby drive the ball farther but they'll say look you know you're not getting fifty seven thousand dollars worth of performance from these clubs you're paying for the bling that they're encrusted with gold and platinum the guy who i interviewed who owns them did say that he 's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them so you know this one this is a coffee made from a very unusual process comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations and apparently it's a very picky eater and it you know homes in on only the ripest coffee cherries and then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats leavings then go through the one of the greatest wines in the world the prince of any wine cellar japan is doing crazy things with there is now a toilet that has an mp three player in it there's one with a fragrance dispenser about all the videotape that remains of an event that set off the longest running mystery in the modern wine world and the mystery existed because of a gentleman named hardy rodenstock and transmits the results via email to your doctor it's almost like a home medical center and that is the direction that japanese toilet technology is this one does not have those bells and whistles but for pure functionality it's pretty much the best the neorest six hundred and to try this i couldn't get a loaner but i did go into the manhattan showroom of the manufacturer toto and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use which i it's fully automated you walk towards it and the seat lifts the seat is preheated there's a water jet that cleans you there's an air jet that dries you you get it flushes by itself the lid closes it self cleans not only is it a technological leap forward but i really do believe it's a bit of a cultural leap forward i mean a no hands no toilet paper toilet and i want to get one of these i could not get a loaner of tom cruise supposedly owns this bed there's a little plaque on the end that you know each buyer gets their name engraved on it to try this one the maker of it let me and my wife spend the night in the manhattan showroom lights this was a fun one this is the fastest street legal car in the world and the most expensive production car i got to drive this with a chaperone from the company i get up to eighty they start to rattle i switched lanes on the highway and the driver this chaperone said you know you were just going one hundred and ten miles an hour and i had no idea that i was one of those obnoxious people you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic because it was just that smooth and if i was a this is a completely gratuitous video i'm just going to show of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology this is tom cruise arriving at the mission impossible and cheval blanc is kind of an unusual wine for bordeaux in having a significant percentage of that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following but it's sixty years old there's not much of it left what there is of it left you don't know if it's real it's considered to be the most faked wine in the world not that many people are looking to pop open their one remaining bottle for a journalist so i'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these i'd put out feelers to retailers to auctioneers and it was coming up empty and then i got an email from a guy named is a uc riverside theoretical physicist who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings and he said i 've got a and it was an invitation you do not refuse i went it was three days four meals and at lunch on saturday we opened the forty seven and call my palate a philistine palate so it doesn't necessarily mean something that i wasn't impressed but i was not the only one there who had that reaction and it wasn't just to that wine he wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles he would not revealexactly where the building was and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building any one of the wines served at this tasting if i'd been served it at a dinner party it would have been you know the wine experience of my lifetime and incredibly memorable but drinking sixty great wines over three days they all just blurred together and it became almost a grueling experience and i just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study which came out earlier this year from some researchers at stanford and caltech and they gave subjects the same wine labeled with different price tags a lot of people you know said that they liked the more expensive wine more it was the same wine but they thought it was a different one that was more expensive but what was unexpected was that these researchers did mri brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag thank you the mystery persisted for about twenty years it finally began to get resolved in two thousand and five because of this bill koch is a florida billionaire who owns four of the jefferson bottles and he

Chateau Lafite is one of the greatest Wines in the world the prince of any wine cellar the longest-running mystery in the modern world and the Mystery existed because of the gentleman named Hardy Road in stock in 1985 he announced his friends in the wine world that he had made this incredible Discovery some workmen in Paris has broken through a brick wall and happened upon this hidden cache of wines apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson's 1787 1784 he wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles he would not reveal exactly where the building was and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building a mystery persisted for about 20 years it finally began to get resolved in 2005 because this guy Bill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles and he became suspicious and you ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-fbi and Scotland Yard agents to. try to get to the bottom of this there's now a evidence that already run stock is a con man and that the Jefferson bottles were fakes but for those 20 years and unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figures in a wine world was drawn into the orbit of these bottles I think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the best bottle of wine the world must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world increasingly voyeuristically interested in the question of you know why do people spend these crazy amounts of money and I don't find it on on lots of things and are they living a better life than me so I decided to embark on a quest with the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes I decided to sample the very best or most expensive the most coveted item in about a dozen categories it which was a very grueling Quest as you can imagine so. this was the first one out of the Kobe beef that you see in the u.s. is not the real thing it may come from whag you tattle but it's not from the original Appalachian hyogo prefecture in Japan for a very cheap places where you can where you can try real probate and one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant cut in Los Angeles I went there and I ordered the 8 oz ribeye for $160 and it arrives and it was Tiny and I was outraged was like $160 for this and then I took a bite and I wish that it was tinier because Kobe beef is so rich it's like flaw Graw it's not even like steak I almost couldn't finish it I was really happy when I was done. it's not a photographer who took the pictures but for this project for some reason post his dog and a lot of them so that's why you're going to see this recurring character not think that one was really worth the price. white truffles one of the most expensive luxury Foods by weight in the world to try this I went to a Mario Batali restaurant in Manhattan don't post the waiter you know it came out with his the white truffle knob and the shaver and see if it on to my pasta and he said yeah I would seen you already like the Truffles and the charm of white truffles is in their Aroma it's not in their tastes really it's not in their texture it's in the smell these white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles this haunting wonderful nutty mushroomy smelled wafted up 10 seconds past and it was gone that you know if this were there for their purpose has been served and so I'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me. the magazine wouldn't pay for me to go there. did you give me a tour of though and this is 4300 square feet it has 360-degree views and as for balconies it was designed by the architect I am pay it comes with Rolls-Royce and Driver comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from when I took the toilet actually included some Opus One glad to see $30,000. this is soap that's made from Silver nanoparticles which have antibacterial properties. I wash my face with this this morning in preparation for this. and it took a little bit and it smelled good but I have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today then again nobody has complimented me on the jeans I'm wearing. these ones GQ did spring for anybody in the months that I've owned and warned this I don't think that whether or not you're getting compliments for you to test if something's value but I think in the case of a fashion item an article of clothing that's what that's a reasonable Benchmark that's a lot of work goes into these they are made from hand-picked organic Zimbabwe and cotton has been shuttling and then hand dipped in natural Indigo 24 times but no compliments. thank you. Armando money is a former filmmaker who makes us olive oil from in all of the grows on a single slope in Tuscany and he goes to Great Lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light fuses tiny bottles the glass is tinted he pops the olive oil off with an inert gas and he actually once he releases a batch of it he regularly conduct molecular analyses and post the results online so you can go online and look at your batch number and see how the phenolic for developing and you know gauge its freshness I did a blind taste test people and five other olive oils it tasted fine as interesting as very green as red pepper dip it in the blind taste test it came in last. the olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of Whole Foods 365 olive oil. which is an oxidizing next to my stove for 6 months. a recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from Japan he'll start to notice and I don't play golf so I couldn't actually road test these but I did interview a guy who owns them even the people who Market these clubs and then I'll say these have for Access shafts which minimize loss of Club speed and thereby Drive the ball farther but don't they look that you know you're not getting $57,000 worth of performance from these clubs you're paying for the bling if they're encrusted with gold and platinum the guy who I interviewed who owns them did say that he's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them so. oh yeah you know this one this is a coffee made from a very unusual process. the lueck is an Asian Palm civet a cat that lives in trees and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations and apparently it's a very picky eater in it you know homes in on only the ripest coffee cherries and then an enzyme and it's just attract leaches into the beans and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats leavings then go through the forest collecting the you know results and processing it into coffee all that you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form.unrelated Lee. Japan is doing crazy things with Twilight. there is now a toilet that has an MP3 player in it was one of the fragrance dispenser there's one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl and transmit the results via email to your doctor it's almost like a home medical center and that is the direction that Japanese toilet does not have those bells and whistles but for Pure functionality it's pretty much the best in the other breast 602 try this I can get a loaner but. I did go into the Manhattan charm of the manufacture of Toto and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use which I use it's fully automated you walk towards the end the seat lifts the seat is preheat there's a water jet that cleans you there's an air jet the dry as you get up it flushes by itself the lid closes itself cleans not only is it a technological Leap Forward but I really do believe it's a bit of a culturally formula No Hands no toilet paper toilet and this. this was another one I could not get a loaner of. Tom Cruise is supposed to leave this bed there's a little plaque on the end that you know each buyer gets their name engraved on it. to try this one the maker of it let me and my wife spend the night in the Manhattan showroom lights blaring in off the street and had to hire a security guard and all these things but we have a great night sleep and just want to start of your life in bed I don't think it's that bad of a deal. this was a fun one. this is the fastest street legal car in the world and the most expensive production car I got to drive this with a chaperone from the company a professional race car driver and we drove around the Canyons outside of Los Angeles in down on the Pacific Coast Highway and you know when we pulled up to the stop light the people in the adjacent cars so I kind of gave us respectful nods and it was really amazing there's such a smooth ride most of the cars that I drive if I get up to 80 they start for Rattle and I switch lanes on the highway in the driver's this Chopper and said you know you were just going 110 miles an hour and I had no idea that I was one of those obnoxious before you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic. Smooth and if I was a billion are we going. this isn't a completely gratuitous video I'm just going to show up one of the pitfalls of advanced technology this is Tom Cruise arriving at the Mission Impossible 3 premiere. dentist open the door you could call it Mission Impossible 4. with one object that I could not get my hands on and it was 1947 Cheval Blanc the 4700 block is probably the most mythologize wine of the 20th century and more do in having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape in 1947 was a legendary vintage especially in the right thing of Bordeaux and just together that vintage in that Chateau took on this aura that eventually kind of gave it to this cultish following but it's 6 years old there's not much of it left what there is a bit left you don't know if it's real it's considered to be the most perfect wine in the world not that many people are looking to pop open there one remaining bottle for a journalist so I'd about given up on trying to get my hands on one of these I put out feelers to retailers auctioneers and is coming up empty and then I got an email from a guy named Pippin Desai. fantasize a UC Riverside theoretical physicist who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings and he said I've got a tasting coming up where we're going to serve the 4700 block of double vertical it was going to be 30 min is a struggle Blanc and 30 vintages of Eat Em and it was 3 days for meals and lunch on Saturday we opened the 47 and softness in it that's not a little bit of linseed oil and then I tasted it and it you know had this kind of unctuous sporty richness which is characteristic of that wine that it sort of resembles port and always there were people at my table who thought it was in a fantastic there are some people who were a little less impressed and. I wasn't that impressed and I don't. call my foot pallet of philistine pallet so so it doesn't necessarily mean something that I wasn't impressed but I was not the only one there who had that reaction and it wasn't just to that wine any one of the wine served at this tasting if I'd been served at a dinner party it would have been you know the wine experience of my lifetime and Incredibly memorable but drinking 60 great wines over three days they'll just blur together and I became almost a a grueling experience and finish by mentioning a very interesting study which came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Cal Tech and they give subjects the same wine labeled with different price tags a lot of people you know said that they like the more expensive wine more was the same one but if they thought it was a different one that's more expensive for what was unexpected was that. these researchers did MRI brain Imaging while the people are drinking the wine and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure from the same wine was labeled with a higher price tag thank you",0.7877604365348816,
49,BenjaminZander_2008.sph.wav,classical music is for everybody everybody now how would you walk because you know my profession the music profession doesn't see it that way they say three percent of the population likes classical music if only we could move it to four percent our problems would be if you thought everybody loves classical music they just haven't found out about it yet see different worlds now i had an amazing experience i was forty five years old i'd been conducting for twenty years i see some of you recognize this child now if he practices for a year and takes lessons he 's now eight and he sounds like this and i suddenly had a realization the conductor of an orchestra doesn't make a sound my picture appears on the front of the cd but the conductor doesn't make a sound he depends for his power on his ability to make other people powerful and that changed everything for me it was totally life changing i wanted to know whether i was doing that and you know how you find out you look at their eyes if their eyes are shining you know you're doing it you could light up a village with this guy 's eyes right so if the eyes are shining you know you're doing it if the eyes are not shining you ask a question and this is the question who am i being that my players eyes are not shining we can do that with our children too who am i being that my children 's eyes that's a totally different world now we're all about to end this magical on the mountain week and we're going back into the world and i say it's appropriate for us to ask the question who are we being as we go back out into the world and you know i have a definition of success for me it's very simple it's not about wealth and fame and power it's about how many shining eyes i have around me so now i have one last thought which is that it really makes a difference what we say the words that come out of our mouth i learned this from a woman who survived auschwitz one of the rare survivors she went to auschwitz when she was fifteen years old and her brother was eight and the parents were lost and she told me this she said we were in the train going to auschwitz and i looked down and saw my brother 's shoes were missing so stupid can't you keep your things together for goodness sake the way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother and i made a vow and the vow was i will never say anything that couldn't stand as the last thing i ever say for another year and takes lessons now he 's nine now can we do that no and we'll make ourselves wrong and others wrong but it is a possibility to live into thank you for another and takes lessons now he 's ten if you'd waited if you'd waited for one more year you would have heard this what happened was not maybe what you thought which is he suddenly became passionate engaged involved got a new teacher he hit puberty or whatever it is what actually happened was the impulses were reduced you see the first time he was playing with an impulse on every note by looking at my head the nine year old the nine year old put an impulse on every and the ten year old on every eight notes and the one impulse on the whole phrase i don't know how we got into this position say i'm going to move my shoulder over move my body no the music pushed me over which is why i call it one you know a gentleman was once watching a presentation i was doing when i was working with a young pianist he was the president of a corporation in ohio and i was working with this young pianist and i said the trouble with you is you're a two buttock player you should be a one buttock player and i moved his body like that while he was playing and suddenly the music took off took flight there was a gasp in the audience when they heard the difference and then i got a letter from this gentleman he said i was so moved i went back and i transformed my entire company into a one and one of them wrote situation hopeless stop they don't wear shoes and the other one wrote glorious opportunity they don't have any shoes yet don't mind now comes the third group these are the people who never listen to classical music it's just simply not part of your life you might hear it like second hand smoke at the airport but people think they're tone deaf actually i hear a lot my husband is tone deaf actually you cannot be tone deaf nobody is tone deaf if you were tone deaf you couldn't change the on your car in a stick shift car you couldn't tell the difference between somebody from texas and somebody from rome and the telephone the telephone if your mother calls on the miserable telephone she calls and says hello you not only know who it is you know what mood she's in you have a fantastic ear everybody has a fantastic ear so nobody is tone deaf but i tell you what it doesn't work for me to go on with this thing with such a wide gulf between those who understand love and passionate about classical music and those who have no relationship the tone deaf people they're no longer here but even between those three categories it's too wide a gulf so i'm not going to go on until every single person in this room downstairs and in aspen and everybody else looking now there's a similar situation in the classical music world because there are some people who think that classical music is dying and there are some of us who think you ain't seen nothing yet will come to love and understand classical music so that's what now you notice that there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that this is going to work if you look at my face it's one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he 's leading to realize whatever he 's dreaming imagine if martin luther king had said i have a dream of course i'm not sure they'll be up to it i think probably happened in this room when i started you thought how beautiful that sounds the same place for our summer holidays next year has it ever occurred to you that the reason you feel sleepy in classical music is not because of you but because of us did anybody think while i was playing why is he using so many impulses if i'd done this with my head you certainly would have thought it and for and rather than go into statistics and trends and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing the rest of your life every time you hear classical music you'll always be able to know if you hear those impulses so let 's see what's really going on here we have a b this is a b the next note is a c and the job of the c is to make the b sad with four sads now we have and the record companies that are folding i thought we should do an experiment tonight an experiment actually it's not really an experiment because i know the outcome that might nobody is tone deaf right nobody is you know every village in bangladesh and every hamlet in china everybody knows da da da da da everybody knows who 's expecting that e now chopin didn't want to reach the e there he backs away and he goes up to him again and almost kills him and the critics all of whom are sitting in the back row there they have to have an opinion so they say hamlet is a procrastinator they say hamlet has an oedipus complex no otherwise the play would be over stupid that's why shakespeare puts all that stuff in hamlet you know ophelia going mad and the play within the play and yorick 's skull and the grave diggers that's in order to delay until act five he can kill him it's the same with the chopin he 's just about to reach the now he gets excited have to worry about it now he gets to f sharp and finally he goes down to now we call that a deceptive cadence because it deceives us i always tell my students if you have a deceptive cadence be sure to raise your eyebrows then everybody will know it's the wrong chord now he tries e again it's the same gesture he makes when he comes home after a long day turns off the key in his car and says aah i'm home because we all know where home is so this is a piece which goes from away to all the way through and you're going to follow b c b c b c b down to a down to g down to f almost goes to e but otherwise the play would be over he goes back up to b he gets very excited to e it's the wrong chord it's the wrong chord it's the wrong chord and finally goes to e and it's home and what you're going to see is one buttock playing for me to join the b to the e i have to stop thinking about every single note along the way and start thinking about the long long line from b to e you know we were just in south africa and you can't go to south africa without thinking of mandela in jail for twenty seven years what was he thinking about lunch to follow the line all the way from b to e and i've one last request before i play this piece all the way through would you think of somebody who you who 's no longer there a beloved grandmother a lover somebody in your life who you love with all your heart but that person is no longer with you bring that person into your mind and at the same time follow the line all the way from b to e and you'll hear everything that now you may be you may be wondering why i'm clapping well i did this at a school in boston with about seventy seventh graders twelve year olds and i did exactly what i did with you and i told them and explained them and the whole thing and at the end they went crazy clapping they were clapping i was clapping they were clapping finally i said why am i clapping and one of the little kids said because we were listening by a piece by chopin now that is something now am i sure that every single person followed that understood it was moved by it of course i can't be sure but i tell you what happened to me i was in ireland and one of them came to me the next morning and he said you know i've never listened to classical music in my life but when you played that shopping piece he said my brother was shot last year and i didn't cry for him but last night when you played that piece he was the one i was thinking about and i felt the tears streaming down my face and you know it felt really good to cry for my brother so i made up my mind at that moment,1,"company love you know the story of the two salesmen who went down to Africa in the 1930s in town to find if there was any opportunity to selling shoes and they wrote telegrams back to mention stuff and one of them rode situation hopeless. They didn't wear shoes and the other one wrote glorious opportunity they don't have any shoes yet. now this is similar situation the classical music world cuz there are some people who think the classical music is dying and there are some of us who think you ain't seen nothing yet and rather than going to statistics and Trends and tell you about all the orchestra's that at closing and the record companies that are folding I thought we should do an experiment tonight and experiment actually it's not really an experiment cuz I knew the outcome. but it's like an experiment now before we. before we start I need to do two things one is I want to remind you of what a seven-year-old child sounds like when he plays the piano maybe you have this child at home he sounds something like.I see some of you recognize this child now if you practice his four-year and takes lessons he's now 8 and he sounds like this. maybe practice for another year takes lessons now he's 9 mini prices for 10. at that point they usually give up. if you'd waited if you'd waited for one more year you would have had this. then what happened was not maybe what you thought which is he suddenly became passionate engaged involved got a new teacher here whatever it is what actually happened was the impulses were reduced to see the first time he was playing with an Impulse on every note. and the second with impulse every other note. Cynthia by looking in my head the nine-year-old then I never opened an invoice on every phone.. And the 10-year old on every eight notes. and the 11-year old one impulse on the whole phrase. I know. I do know how it goes into this position. I didn't say I'm going to move my shoulder of a move my buddy knows the music push me over which is why I called it one Buffett playing. you know gentleman was once watching a presentation I was doing and I was working with Young Tennis to he was the president of the corporation in Ohio and I was working with this young panics and I said the trouble with you is you are to budget player you should be the one bus at player and I moved his body like that while he was playing the music took off on this gentleman he said I was so moved I went back and I transfer my entire company in 201 bus at company. not the other thing I want to do is to tell you about you there a 1600 people I believe my estimation is so probably 45 of you I absolutely passionate about classical music adult asking Museo FM is always on that classical dial and you have CDs in your car and you go to the symphony and your children they're playing instruments that's the first group is quite as more vendors and other group bigger group these are the people who don't mind classical music. yeah you come home from a long day and you take a glass of wine and you put your feet up a little divaldi in the background doesn't do anyhow gospel music it's just simply not part of your life you might hear it like secondhand smoke at the airport but I may be a little bit of a March from Aida when you come into the hole that otherwise you never hear that's probably the largest group of all and then there's a very small group these are the people who who sings that tone deaf amazing number people think that turned that actually I have I lost my husband has turned it actually you cannot be tuned at nobody is tone-deaf if you would told me that you couldn't change the gears on your car in a stick shift car you couldn't tell the difference between somebody from Texas and somebody for Road. I need the telephone the telephone it's something your mother calls I'm a miserable telephone she pulls in says hello you know I didn't even know who it is you know what mood she's in you have a fantastic year everybody has a fantastic nobody is tone-deaf but I tell you what it doesn't work for me to go on with this thing with such a wide Gulf between those who understand love and passionate about classical music and those who have no relationship to Adorn the tone deaf people they're no longer here but even between those three categories it's too wide ago so I'm not going to go until every single person in this room downstairs and in Aspen and everybody else looking. will come to love and understand that's cool music so that's what we going to do now you notice that there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that this is going to work if you look at my face oh it's one of the characteristics of a leader that he knocked out for one moment the capacity of the people he's leading to realize whatever he's dreaming imagine if Martin Luther King and said I have a dream cuz I know they'll be up to it. all right so I got to take a piece of shop at this is a beautiful Prelude by Chopin some of you will know it. you know what I think probably happened in this room when I started you thought how beautiful that sounds. I do think you should go to the same place for all summer holidays next year. it's funny how they kind of walked into your head when we listen to gospel music. I requested pieces long you've had a long day you might actually drift off then your companion will give you the rest. but has it ever occurred to you that the reason you feel sleeping classical music is not because of you but because of us did anybody think while I was like why is he using so many impulses if I done this with my head you said you would have thought it. and for the rest of your life every time you hear classical music you always be able to know if you hear those impulses so let's see what's really going on here we have Abby this is Abby the next note is C and the job of the sea is to make the be sad and it does. composers know that if they want sad music they just pay their students. the basic is just to be with four sides. navigate to Santa Fe. now to GE and then to ask next. that might be the flute let's try it again. the Ted quiet. you know just nobody is tone-deaf nobody is here. Every village in Bangladesh and every everybody knows who his uncle killed his father you really keeps on going up to something almost killing him and then he backs away and then he goes out to him again and almost killed him in the critics old from sitting in the back row that they have to have an opinion so they say having it is a procrastinator or they say it's time to test an Oedipus Complex. that's why Shakespeare puts all that stuff inhabited to know if either getting mad in the play with in the play and you are expelled and the gravediggers steps in order to delay until act fighting kill him it's the same she's just about to reach the better go back up and do it again so he does it again now he gets excited and you don't have to worry about it now you get stuff shop and find that he goes down to eat but it's a long cord cuz the police looking for is this one. deceptive Cadence. hi. so I guess you even in Toronto now you try to see you again see you again. Jasmine the front of you in the same gesture he makes me comes home after a long day turns off the key in his car and says I'm home cuz we all know what home is so this is a piece which goes from a way to home and I'm going to pay it all the way through and you're going to follow bcbc bcbc play would be over cuz back out to be gets very excited about this tree is wrong towards the wrong towards the wrong port and finally goes to eat and it's home and what you going to see is playing. Focus for me to join the B to the E I have to stop thinking about every single note along the way and stop thinking about the long long line from b2e in South Africa and you can't go to South Africa Mandela in jail know he was thinking about the fishing for South Africa and for human beings that's what this is about fishing this is about the long line like the bird who flies over the field and doesn't care about the fences underneath so now you going to follow the line all the way from B to eat I live one last request before I pay this piece all the way through would you think of somebody who you a door. who's no longer there a beloved grandmother I love her somebody in your life who you love with all your heart but that person is no longer with you. bring that person into your mind and at the same time follow the line all the way from B to e and you'll see everything that you had to say.you made you made me wondering you you you may be wondering. you may be wondering why I'm clapping while I did this to the school in Boston with about 77th graders 12 year olds and I did exactly what I did with you and I told him I'd explain them the whole thing is crazy, why am I listening. think of it 1600 people busy people involved in all sorts of different things listening understanding and being moved by a piece by chauffeur now that is something now I might show that every single person followed that understood it was moved by the course I can't be sure of it I can see what happened to me I was in Ireland during the troubles 10 years ago and I was working with some Catholic and kids conflict resolution and I did this with them risky thing to do to save a streak kids. and one of them came to me the next morning. and he said you know I've never listen to classical music in my life but when you played that shopping piece. he said my brother was shot last year and I didn't cry for him but last night when you played that piece he was the one I was thinking about. and I felt the tears streaming down my face and you know it felt really good to cry for my brother so I made up my mind at that moment but classical music is for everybody everybody. now how would you walk but you know my profession the music profession doesn't see it that way they say 3% of the population likes classical music if we could move it to 4 %. Problems will be up. I say how would you walk how would you talk how would you be if you sold 3% of the population likes custom is there any way we could move it to 4 to 10 how would you walk how would you talk I would you be if you thought everybody loves classical music stitches haven't found out of bed yet. CDC totally different worlds now I had an amazing experience I was 45 years old I've been conducting for 20 years and I'm suddenly had a realization the conductor of an orchestra doesn't make a sound my picture appears on the front of the CD. but the conductor doesn't make a sound he Depends for his power on this ability to make other people powerful and that changed everything for me it was totally life to Angie miles to Kmart to me to tape and what happened that's what happened I realize my job was to awaken possibility in other people and of course I want you to know what I was doing that and you know how you find out if you look at the eyes the eyes are shining you know you're doing it. you could light up a village with this guy's eyes. but Joey is the IC shiny you know you're doing it it's the eyes are not trying to get to ask a question and this is the question who am I being. that my players eyes are not shiny we can do that without children to who am I being. that my children's eyes are not shiny that's a totally different world now we're all about to end this magical on the mountain week have a going back into the world and I say it's appropriate for us to ask the question who will we be as we go back out into the world and you don't have a definition of success for me it's very simple it's not about wealth and fame and power it's about how many shining eyes I have around me so now I have one lost sword which is that it really makes a difference what we say. the words that come out of Mama's I learned this from a woman who survived Auschwitz one of the rare survivors she went to Auschwitz when she was 15 years old. and dumb. her brother was eight and the parents were lost. and she told me that she said. we were in the train going to Auschwitz and I looked on the show my brother shoes with missing. and I said why are you so stupid can't you keep your things together for goodness sake the way of the elder sister might speak to younger brother. unfortunately it was the last thing she ever said to him cuz she never saw him again he did not survive and so when she came out about you and she made a vow she told me this she said I walked out if I switch into life. and I made a vow and the vial was I will never say anything that couldn't stand as the last thing I ever say. now can we do that know and we'll make ourselves wrong and all this wrong. but it is a possibility to live into. thank you. try guys. shining eyes. psychiatrist",0.6796875,
50,BenoitMandelbrot_2010.sph.wav,now this is the real it's a cauliflower now why do i show a cauliflower a very ordinary and ancient vegetable because old and ancient as it may be it's very complicated and it's very simple both at the same time if you try to weigh it of course it's very easy to weigh it and when you eat it the weight matters but suppose you try to measure its surface very interesting if you cut with a sharp knife one of the florets of a cauliflower and look at it separately you think of a whole cauliflower but smaller and then you cut again again again again again again again again again and you still get small cauliflowers so the experience of humanity has always been that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property that each part is like the whole but smaller did humanity do with that very very little so what i did actually is to study this problem and i found something surprising that one can measure roughness by a number a number two point three one point two and sometimes much more one day a friend of mine to bug me brought a picture and said what is the roughness of this curve i said well just short of one point five it was one point time i've been looking at these things for so long so these numbers are the numbers which denote the roughness of these surfaces i hasten to say that these surfaces and so on the left i took the roughness copied from many landscapes to the right i took a higher roughness so the eye after a while can distinguish these two very well well the topic i'm going to discuss is one which is in a certain sense very peculiar because it's very old roughness is part of human life to learn about measuring roughness this is very rough and this is sort of smooth and this perfectly smooth very few things are very smooth so then if you to ask questions what's the surface of a cauliflower well you measure and measure and measure each time you're closer it gets bigger very very small distances what's the length of the coastline of these lakes the closer you measure the longer it the concept of length of coastline which seems to be so natural because it's given in many cases is in fact completely fallacy there's no such thing you must do it differently what good is that to know these things well surprisingly enough it's good in many ways to begin with artificial landscapes which i invented sort of are used in cinema all the time we see mountains in the distance they may be mountains but they may be just just cranked on now it's very easy to do it used to be very time consuming but now it's nothing something very strange if you take this thing you know very well it weighs very little the volume of a lung is very small but what about the area of why so because in fact the area of the lung is something very the bronchi branch branch branch and they stop branching not because of any matter of principle but because of physical considerations the mucus which is in the lung so what happens is that the way you have a much bigger lung but if it branches and branches down to distances about the same for a whale for a man and for what good is it to have that well surprisingly enough amazingly enough the anatomists had a very poor idea of the structure of the lung until very recently and i think that my mathematics so i found myself in other words constructing a geometry a geometry of things which had no geometry and a surprising aspect of it is that very often the rules of this geometry are extremely short it several times sometimes repeatedly again again again the same repetition and at the end you get things like that this cloud is completely one hundred percent artificial something so complicated like a cloud so unstable so varying should have a simple rule behind it now this simple rule not an explanation of clouds the seer of clouds had to take account of it i don't know how much advanced these pictures are they're old i was very much involved in it but then turned my attention to other phenomena now here is another thing which is one of the shattering events in the history of mathematics which is not appreciated by many people different kinds of mess now in fact by a complete fluke i got involved many years ago in a study of this form of complexity to an extent which was absolutely amazing that man can invent things that nature in particular it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane a curve 's a curve a plane 's a plane and the two won 't mix well they do mix a man named peano did define such curves and it became an object of extraordinary interest it was very important but mostly interesting because a kind of break a separation between the mathematics coming from reality on the one hand and new mathematics coming from pure man 's mind well i was very sorry to point out that the pure man 's mind has in fact seen at long last what had been seen for a long time and so here i introduce something the set of rivers of a plane filling curve and well it's a story unto itself and the objects which were used as examples when i was a child and a student of the break between mathematics and visible reality those objects i turned them completely around i used them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature i first told it to my friends in mathematics they said don 't be silly it's just something well actually i was and to my utter amazement i found traces very strong traces i must say of order in that painter hokusai knew it very well the things on the ground are algae he did not know the mathematics it didn't yet exist and he was japanese who had no contact with the west but painting for a long time had a fractal side i could speak of that for a long time has a fractal aspect and i read the book that mister eiffel wrote about his tower and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood this is a mess mess mess brownian loop one day i decided i was held by so many things in my work i decided to test myself could i just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time and find something dramatically new then i was telling my assistant i don't see anything can you paint it so he painted it which means he put inside everything he said well this thing came out and i said stop stop stop i see it's an island and amazing so brownian motion which happens to have a roughness number of two i measured it one point three three again again again long measurements big brownian motions one point three three mathematical problem how to prove it it took my friends twenty years three of them were having incomplete proofs they got together and together they had the proof and so today i would like to present to you a few examples of what this represents i prefer the word roughness to the word irregularity because irregularity to someone who had latin so they got the big medal in mathematics one of the three medals that people have received for proving things which i've seen without being able to prove them now everybody asks me at one point or another how did it all start what got you in that strange business to be at the same time a mechanical engineer a geographer and a mathematician and so on well actually i started oddly enough studying stock market prices and so here i had this theory and i wrote books about it it was very easy and you can write many books very fast about it there are thousands of books on that now compare that with real price increments and where are real price increments well these other lines include some real price increments and some forgery which i did so the idea there was that one must able to how do you say model price variation and it went really well fifty years ago for fifty years people were sort of pooh poohing me because they could do it much much easier but i tell you at this point people listened to me these two curves are averages standard poor the blue one and the red one is standard poor 's from which the five biggest discontinuities are taken out now discontinuities are a nuisance so in many studies of prices one puts them aside well acts of and you have the little nonsense which is left acts of god in this picture five acts of god are as important as everything in other words it is not acts of god that we should put aside that is the meat the problem if you master these you master price and if you don't master these you can master the little noise as well as you can but it's not important well here are the curves for it now i get to the final thing which is the set of which my name is attached in my long past youth means the contrary of regularity but it is not so regularity is the contrary of in a way it's the story of my life my adolescence was spent during the german occupation of france and since i thought that i might vanish within a day or a week i had very big dreams and after the war i saw an uncle again my uncle was a very prominent mathematician and he told me look there's a problem which i could not solve twenty five years ago and i went from what's called real numbers which are points on a line to imaginary complex numbers which are points on a plane which is what one should do there and this shape came out this shape is of an extraordinary complication equation is hidden there z goes into z squared plus c it's so simple so dry it's so uninteresting now you turn the crank once twice twice marvels come out i mean this comes out i don't want to explain these things this comes out this comes out shapes which are of such complication such harmony and such beauty because the basic aspect of the world is very rough so let me show you a few objects some of them are artificial others of them are very real in a certain sense this comes out repeatedly again again again and that was one of my major discoveries was to find that these islands were the same as the whole big thing more or less and then you get these extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place all that from this little formula which has whatever five symbols in it and then this one the color was added for two reasons first of all because these shapes are so complicated one couldn't make any sense of the numbers and if you plot them you must choose some system and so my principle has been to always present the shapes with different colorings because some colorings emphasize that and others it is that or that it's so complicated a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing so where did this come from obviously from so the newspaper in cambridge published an article about that discovery and received the next day five thousand letters from people saying but that's simply a mandelbrot set very well let me finish this shape here just came out of an exercise in pure mathematics bottomless wonders spring from simple rules which are repeated without end thank you very much,1,thank you very much he's excuse me for sitting under the old because it's very old in human life forever and forever and ancient in a certain sense it seemed to be the extreme of complexity just a mess and messing up miss that many different kinds of a mess in fact I got in the world many years ago in the study of of this form of complexity and do my daughter amazement I found it tastes very strong traces of order in that roughness and so I would like to present to you if you are examples of what. United because somebody had in my lawn fast Yusuf means the country is it country of roughness because the basic aspect of the world is very rough so let me show you and older men anxious as maybe it's very complicated and it's very simple nursing time if you try to wait then the way to Metro Zoo. flower flower the humanity has always been that they are some shapes which have this particular property that each part is like the whole. not a what did you mean to do is that very very little. what I did actually through is to study the problem and found my number 1.2 and sometimes much more when a friend of mine is the definition of this perverted well-dressed Rota 1.5 with 1.48 it didn't think any time are the number to he didn't know what to do roughness of the he surfaces and that number is roughness. and so I took today right after while can distinguish do you mind if you have to learn about Metra I do ask questions how what surface are cauliflower where do you measure measure measure length of Coastline of the concept of length is in fact complete policy there's no such thing you must do it different. what good is that to know these things surprisingly enough is good in many ways the time in distance formula that City longer be something very strange if you would take this thing you know very well it is very little but what about the area of the lung. anatomists we're arguing you're very much about that some say that no longer has an area inside of a basketball and the other state basketballs and not because of any longer so what happens is that so if you have that was surprisingly enough amazingly enough. I think that's my mathematics what is branching systems which for wish to know geometry and surprising aspect of it is that very often the rules of this drama t-shirt your formulas that long did leave again again again to see more proficient and at the end you get things like that this cloud is completely one-hundred-percent artificial 99.9 and the only thought which is natural is a number their definition of cloud which is taken from nature seems so complicated so unstable. behind it and see if it had to take I don't know how much these pictures are too old I was very much involved in it but then turn my attention to other phenomena are they one of them chattering events in the history of mathematics which is not appreciated by many people began to create the shapes that didn't exist in two things that nature did not know in particular it could invent things like a river which feeds the plane a curved curve. amending piano and became an object of it it kind of break a separation between the mathematics coming from reality is coming for Pure remind Alex that the pure my man's mind has in fact. team at long last without being seen for a long time and so here I introduce something the set of rivers of a lien feeling. And the well it's a story unto itself so it was 25 and 25 from the world and the objects which were used as examples and examples of the break between mathematics and visible objects are used for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nation in 1919 introduced a number which was just a joke and I found this number was a good measurement of my friends. they think they're hot sign news very well it seems to have no contact with a binky for a long time have the factor outside that we speak of that for a long time I felt our key understood this is a mess mess mess. I was headed by so many things in my worker I decided to take this myself. Could I just look at something which everybody had a long time and something dramatic can you sing emotion then I was telling my assistant I don't see anything can you play Ain't It so he painted the inside everything when I see you tonight and. and then amazing you so Brian motion which happens to a breathless to number 1.33 on measurements of big emotions 1.33 mathematical problem how to prove it it took my friend 20 years the group together and together they have the proof. so is it Go table for proving things without being able to prove them. no everybody head faster at one point or another how do you do start what's got you in that strange your business and I thought about it financial crisis increments fashionable really fast about it so. compare gas price increments increments of one must be able to have the safe model X navigation and who do much much much easier but I tell you at this point people listen to me. this this to Curves are averages for the blue one from which the five biggest taken out notice what you do with these are a nuisance to show in many studies of prices of the road on this picture at 5 if you master these are you must have rice and if you don't Master this you can Master Dylan noise as well as you can but it's not important when she had the curves for it now I get to find a thing which sets of my name attached to the Story of My Life. since when I saw that I might make vanish with the day of the week and then there's a problem which I could not solve 25 years ago. and there's nobody can seem sort of this is construction Normandin if you could find something New York City simple so I dukes and like the thousands of people at right before I found nothing. but then the computer game and I decided to do a flight from pewter not to new problematic went from Woods Hole to heal numbers are going to the 9 to imagine the complex numbers which are points in the plane which is what one should do their job and they shave him out the shape of an extraordinary complication the equation is sitting there goes into an interesting you turn the crank one twice twice. Marvel's come out interview team event extranaba rock decoration over the place that from this little formula which has has whatever five symbols and this one the color was I did it for two reasons first of all because these shapes are so complicated. doctor make any sense of the numbers and if you plug them you must choose some system and my principal has been to always present the shapes with different color Rings because some coloring is emphasized that another thing is that it's so complicated in 1990 from the University and then a few days later a pilot was flying over the night sleep and found this thing so where did it come from obviously from the 5000 letters from people saying but that's a beautiful baby girl. we'll try to keep it Without End thank you very much,0.64453125,
51,BertrandPiccard_2009G.sph.wav,so you see this is what we're doing on our side everyone has his goal has his dreams has his visions the question i leave you with now is which is the ballast you would like to throw overboard which will be the altitude at which you would like to fly in your life to get to the success that you wish to have to get to the point that really belongs to you with the potential you have and the one you can really fulfill because the most renewable energy we have how do we steer a balloon by understanding that the atmosphere is made out of several different layers of wind which all have different direction so then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory in life or in the balloon we have to change altitude but how do we do that in ballooning or in life how do we change altitude how do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day well in a balloon it's easy we have ballast and when we drop the ballast overboard we climb sand water all the equipment we don't need anymore and i think in life it should be exactly like this you know when people speak about pioneering spirit well very often they believe that pioneers are the ones who have new ideas it's not true the pioneers are not the ones who have new ideas because new ideas are so easy to have we just close our eyes for a minute we all come back with a lot of new ideas learned a lot of things about ballooning especially at the end of these balloon flights around the world i did with brian jones the pioneer is the one who allows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast habits certainties convictions exclamation marks paradigms dogmas and when we are able to do that what happens life is not anymore just one line going in one direction in one dimension no life is going to be made out of all the possible lines that go in all the possible directions in three and pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves to explore this vertical axis of course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon but in life itself this is very practical this can be in politics this can be in spirituality this can be in environment in finance in education of children i deeply believe that life is a much greater adventure if we manage to do politics when i took this picture the window was frozen because of the moisture of the night and on the other side there was a rising sun i deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment if we get rid if we throw overboard this fundamentalism that some of the greens have showed in the past and that we can aim for much higher spirituality if we get rid of the religious dogmas throwing overboard as ballast to change our direction well these basically are things i believed in such a long time but actually i had to go around the world in a balloon to be invited to talk about it one who calculate the direction of each layer of wind at which altitude in order to help the balloonist but sometime it's very paradoxal when brian jones and i were flying around the world the weather man asked us one day to fly quite low and very slow and when we calculated we thought we're never going to make it around the world at that speed so we disobeyed we flew much higher and double the speed and i was so proud to have found that jetstream that i called the weather man and i told him hey guy don't you think we're good pilots up there we fly twice the speed you predicted and he told me don 't do that go down immediately in order to slow down so you see that on the other side of ice you have the unknown you have the non obvious you have the non seen for the people who don't dare to go through the ice and i started to argue i said i 'm not going to do that we don't have enough gas to fly so slow and he told me yes but with the low pressure you have on your left if you fly too fast in a couple of hours you will turn left and end up at the north pole and then he asked me and this is something i will never forget in my life he just asked me you 're the good pilot up there what do you really want you want to go very fast in the wrong direction or slowly in the good direction and this is why you need weathermen this is why you need people with long term vision and this is precisely what fails in the political visions we have now in the political governments we are burning as you heard so much energy not understanding that such an unsustainable way of life can not last for long so we went down actually we slowed down and we went through moments of fears because we had no idea how the little amount of gas we had in the balloon could allow us to travel forty five thousand kilometers in the middle of the pacific when you don't have the good winds you can not land you can not go back that's a crisis that's the moment when you have to wake up from the automatic way of thinking that's the moment when you have to motivate your inner potential your creativity that's when you throw out all the ballast all the certainties in order to adapt to the new situation and actually we changed completely our flight plan we changed completely our strategy and after twenty days we landed successfully in egypt but if i show you this picture it's not to tell you how happy we were it's to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles we took of with three point seven tons of liquid propane we landed with forty kilos when i saw that i made a promise to myself i made a promise that the next time i would fly around the world it would be with no fuel so many people who prefer to suffer in the ice they know instead of taking the risk of going through the ice to see what there is on the other side i had no idea how it was possible i just thought it's a dream and i want to do it and when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the air and space museum in washington together with the airplane of charles lindbergh with apollo eleven with the wright brothers flier with chuck yeager 's sixty one i had really a thought then i thought well the twentieth century that was brilliant it allowed to do all those things there but it will not be possible in the future any more it takes too much energy it will cost too much it will be prohibited because we'll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now so how can we perpetuate this pioneering spirit with something that will be independent from fossil energy and this is when the project solar impulse really started to turn in my head it has been done but rather to improve the quality of life how can we go through the ice of certainty in order to make the most incredible a possible thing what is today completely impossible rid of our dependency on fossil energy if you tell to people we want to be independent from fossil energy in our world people will laugh at you except here where crazy people are invited to speak and i think that's one of the main problems of our society we learn maybe not the famous ted audience but so many other people learn so the idea is that if we fly around the world in a solar powered airplane using absolutely no fuel nobody ever could say in the future that it's impossible to do it for cars for heating systems for computers and so on and so on well solar power airplanes are not new they have flown in the past but without saving capabilities without batteries which means that they have more proven the limits of renewable energies than the potential of if we want to show the potential we have to fly day and night that means to load the batteries during the flight in order to spend the night on the batteries and fly the next day again it has been made already on remote controlled little airplane models without pilots but it stays an anecdote because the public couldn't identify to i think you need a pilot in the plane that can talk to the universities that can talk to students talk to politicians during the flight and really make it a human adventure that unfortunately four meters wingspan is not enough you need sixty four meter wingspan because fuel is not easy to replace that's for sure and with two hundred square meters of solar power on our plane we can produce the same energy than two hundred little lightbulbs that means a christmas tree a big christmas tree the unknown the doubts the question marks are dangerous and we have to resist to the changes we have to keep everything under control so the question is how can you carry a pilot around the world with an airplane that uses the same amount of energy as a big christmas tree people will tell you it's impossible and that's exactly why we try to do it we have gone through the stages of simulation design computing preparing the construction of the first prototype that has been achieved after two years of work propeller engine just the fuselage here it's so light it's not designed by an artist but it could be fifty kilos for the entire fuselage couple of kilos more for the wing spars this is the complete structure of the airplane and one month ago we have unveiled it you can not imagine how it is for a team who has been working six years on it to show that it's not only a dream and a vision it's a real airplane real airplane that we could finally present and what's the goal now the goal is to take end of this year for the first test but mainly next year spring or summer take off on our own power without additional help without being to nine thousand meters altitude the same time we load the batteries we run the engines and when we get at the maximum we arrive at the beginning of the night and there there will be just one goal just one reach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty well the unknown is part of life and in that sense ballooning is a beautiful metaphor because in the balloon like in life and this is exactly the symbol of our world if our airplane is too heavy if the pilot wastes energy never make it through the night and in our world if we keep on spoiling wasting our energy resources if we keep on building things that consume so much energy that most of the companies now go bankrupt it's clear that we'll never give the planet to the next generation without a major problem so you see that this airplane is more a symbol i don't think it will transport two hundred people in the next but when lindbergh crossed the atlantic the payload was also just sufficient for one person and some fuel and twenty years later there were two hundred people in every airplane crossing the atlantic so we have to start and show the example a little bit like on this picture here this is a painting from in the museum in holland that i love so much it's a pipe and it's written this is not a pipe this is not an airplane this is a symbol of what we can achieve when we believe in the impossible when we have a team when we have pioneering spirit and especially when we understand that all the certainties we have should be thrown overboard pleases me very much is that in the beginning i thought that we would have to fly around the world with no fuel in order to have our message been understood and more and more we're invited around the world with andre to talk about that project to talk about the symbol of it invited by politicians invited in we go very well in unforeseen directions we want to go in a direction but the winds push us in another direction like in life energy forums in order to show that it's not anymore completely stupid to think about getting rid of the dependency on fossil energies so through speeches like this one today through interviews through meetings our goal is to get as many people possible on the team success will not come if we just quote unquote fly around the world in a solar powered airplane no the success will come if enough people are motivated to do exactly the same in their daily life save energy go to renewables and this is possible you know with the technologies we have today we can save between thirty and fifty percent of the energy of a country in europe and we can solve half of the rest with renewables it leaves twenty five or thirty percent for oil gas coal nuclear or whatever this is acceptable this is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team you can just go on solarimpulse com subscribe to just be informed of what we're doing but much more to get advices to give your comments to spread the word that if it's possible in the air of course it's possible in the and as long as we fight horizontally against life against the winds against what's happening to us life is a nightmare and each time we have some ice in the future we have to know that life will be great and the success will be brilliant if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice to go through the obstacle to go through the problem in order to see what there is on the other side,1,"I learned a lot of things about ballooning especially at the ends of these balloon flight around the world I did with Brian Jones when I took this picture. the window was frozen because of the moisture of the night and then the other side there was a rising sun. so you see that's on the other side of ice. you have the unknown you have the none of juice you have the nun scene for the people who don't dare to go through the eyes that so many people who prefer to suffer in the eyes they know instead of taking the risk of going through the eyes to see what there is on the other side. and I think that's one of the main problem of our society we learn maybe not descendants Ted audience but so many other people learn that the unknown the doubt the question marks how dangerous and we have to resist to the changes we have to keep everything under control. well the unknown is part of life and in that sense ballooning is a beautiful metaphor because it like in life we do very well in unforeseen directions to go in a direction that the winds push us in another Direction like in life and as long as we fight horizontally against life against the win against what's happening to us life is a nightmare. how do we steer a Balloon by understanding that the atmosphere is made out of several different layers of wind which all have different direction. so then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory in Life or in the balloon we have to change altitude. changing altitude in life that means raising to another psychological or philosophical spiritual level. but how do we do that in ballooning or in life how do we change altitude how do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use everyday we have ballast and when we drop the balance to the board we climb sound water old equipment we don't need any more like it should be exactly like this you know when people speak about pioneering Spirit very offended believe that pioneers of the one have new IDs it's not true the Pioneers another one have new ideas because new ideas are so easy to have we just close our eyes for a minute we all come back with a lot of new ideas know the Pioneers the one who allows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast. habits certainties convictions exclamation marks. paradigm's dogmas and when were able to do that what happens. life is not anymore just one line going in One Direction in one dimension know life is going to be made out of all the possible lines that go in all the possible directions in three dimensions. and pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves to explore these vertical axis of course not just like in the atmosphere in the balloon but in life itself that means explore all the different ways to do all the different ways to behave all the different ways to think before we find the one that goes in the direction we wish. this is very practical this can be in politic. this can be in spirituality in environments in finance education of children believe that life is much greater Adventure if we manage to do politic without the trench between the left and the right wing because you will throw away this political documents. I deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment if we get rid if we threw overboard this time the matter is that some of the greens have shown in the past and that we can a much higher spirituality if we get rid of the religious dogmas. triangle be bold as ballast to change a direction well this busy clearing things I believe in such a long time but I actually have to go around the world in the balloon to be invited to talk about it.it's clear that it's not easy to know which ballast to drop and which altitude to take some time we need friends family members of a psychiatrist wedding balloons we need weatherman the one who calculate the direction of each layer of went at which altitude in order to help the balloonist but sometimes when Brian Jones and I were flying around the world the way the name the Oscars one day to fly quite low and very slow and when we calculated without we're never going to make it from the world at that speed so we disobeyed which were much higher than double the speed and I was so proud to have found that dress dream that I called the weather man that told him a guy don't you think we're good Pilots up there we fly twice the speed predicted. and he told me don't do that go down immediately in order to slow down and I started to argue I said I'm not going to do that we don't have enough gas to fly so slow and he told me yes but for the low pressure you have on your left if you fly too fast in a couple of hours you will turn left and end up at the North Pole. and then he asked me. and this is something I would never forget in my life he just asked me you the good part of their what do you really want you want to go very fast in the wrong direction or slowly the good direction. and this is why you need to wear them this is why you need people with long-term vision and this is precisely what fails in the political divisions we have now in the political governments we are burning as you heard so much energy not understanding that such a sustainable way of life. so we went down actually we slow down and we went through mom to fears because we had no idea how the little amount of gas we had in the balloon poodle hours to travel 45000 kilometers. but you accepted to have doubts who accepted to have fears and actually this is where the adventure really started when we were flying over the Sahara and then yeah it was nice holidays with Woodland anytime and fly back home dinner plans in the middle of the Pacific when you don't have the good ones you cannot slam you cannot go back that's a Rises that's the moment where you have to wake up from the automatic way of thinking that's the moment where you have to let you date your inner potential your creativity that's when you threw out all the ballast all the certainties in order to adapt to the new situation and actually we can complete your flight plan will change completely our strategy and after 20 days we landed successfully in Egypt. but if I show you this picture it's not to tell you how happy we where it's to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles. we took off with 3.7 tons of liquid propane. we landed with 40K. when I sold out I made a promise to myself I made the promise that the next time I would fly around the world it would be with no fuel. independent from fossil energies in order to be safe not to be threatened by the fuel gauge I have no idea how it was possible I just thought it's a dream and I want to do it. and when the capsule of my balloon was introduced official in the air and space museum in Washington together with the airplane of Charles Lindbergh with Apollo 11 with the Wright brothers flyer with Chuck Yeager 61 I have really thought then I thought well the 20th century that was brilliant it allowed to do all these things there. but it would not be possible in the future anymore it takes too much energy it would cost too much it would be prohibited because we have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now so how can we perpetuate this pioneering spirit. with something that would be independent from fossil energy and this is when the project solar impulse really started to turn in my head and I think it's a nice metaphor also for the 21st century pioneering Spirit should continue but on another level not to conquer the planet of space not anymore but rather to improve the quality of life how can we go through the eyes of certainty in order to make the most incredible that possible thing. what is today completely impossible. get rid of a dependency on fossil energy. if you tell it to people we want to be independent from fossil energy in the world people will laugh at you accept here where crazy people invited to speak. so the idea is that if we fly around the world in a solar-powered airplane using absolutely no fuel nobody ever could say in the future that it's impossible to do it for Cal for heating system for computers and so on and so on. what solar power airplanes on the new they have flown in the past but without saving capacities without batteries which means that they have more proven the limits of renewable energies them the potential of it if we want to show the potential we have to fly day and night that means to load the batteries during the flight in order to spend the night on the batteries and Supply the next day again it has been made already on remote controls little airplane models without pilot and it stays the public wouldn't identify to it I think you need a pilot in the plane that can talk to the universities that can talk to students do to politicians during the flight and we make it to Human Adventure. all that unfortunately for me wingspan is not enough unit 64 M wingspan 64 wingspan to carry One Pilots the batteries slowly enough with the aerodynamic efficiency is not easy to replace that's for sure and with two hundred square metres of solar power on airplane we can produce the same energy than 200 little light bulbs that means a Christmas tree a big Christmas tree so the question is how can you carry a pilot around the world with an airplane that uses the same amount of energy as a big Christmas tree. people will tell you it's impossible and it's exactly why we try to do it. we don't see the project with my credit card above bearing 6 years ago. we have now is 70 people in the team working on it we have gone through the stages of simulation design Computing preparing the construction of the first prototype that has been achieved after 2 years of work cook B propeller engine just diffuse large here with so lied it's not designed by you know it is but it could be fifty kilos for the entire large couple of kilos more for the wing spars this is the complete structure of the airplane and one month ago we have in veiled it you can imagine how it is for a team who's been working six years on it to show that it's not only a dream and vision it real airplane a real airplane that we could finally present and what's the goal now the goal is to take up. end of this year for the first test but Mindy next year spring or summer pick up on our own power without additional help without being told climb to five thousand meters altitude with it at the same time we load the batteries we run the engines and when we get at the maximum height. we arrived at the beginning of the night and there they will be just one goal just one reach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty. and this is exactly the symbol of a world he's our airplane is too heavy you're the pilot waste his energy will never make it through the night and in our world if we keep on wasting our energy resources if we keep on building things that consume so much energy that's most of the company is now go bankrupt. it's clear that would never give the pendant to the next generation without a major problem. so you see that this airplane is more symbol I don't think it will transport 200 people in the next year's but when Lindbergh cross the Atlantic Ocean for one person and some fuel and 20 years later they were 200 people in every airplane crossing the Atlantic so we have to start and show the example painting from Madrid Museum in Holland that I love so much it's a pipe and it's written this is not to bite. this is not an airplane. this is a symbol of what we can achieve when we believe in the impossible when we have a team when we have pioneering spirit and specially when we understand that's all the certainties we have should be thrown overboard. what's pleases me very much is that in the beginning I said that we would have to fly around the world with no fuel in order to have a message being understood and more and more were invited around the world with the older hate to talk about that project to talk about the symbol of it righted by politicians invited in energy forms in order to show that it's not any more completely stupid to think about getting rid of the dependency on fossil energy is so true speeches like this one today through interviews through meetings our goal is to get as many people as possible in the team. this success will not come if we just go out and go to fly around the world in a solar-powered airplane know the success will come if enough people are motivated to do exactly the same in their daily life save energy Renewables and this is possible you know where the Technologies we have today we can save between 30 and 50% of the energy of a country in Europe. and we can sell half of the rest with Renewables it leaves 25 or 30% for. all-gas call you clear or whatever this is acceptable this is why all the people who believe in this type of spirits are welcome to be in the team you can just go on soldering post that gum subscribe to just be informed of what we're doing but much more to get advisors to give your commands to spread the word that if it's possible in the air of course it's possible in the ground. and each time we have some ice in the future we have to know that life would be great and the success would be brilliant if we dare to overcome our fear of the eyes to go through the obstacle to go through the problem in order to see what there is on the other side. so you see this is what we're doing on the outside. everyone has his goal has his dreams has his visions. the question I leave you with now is which is the baddest you would like to throw the board which will be the altitude at which you would like to fly in your life. to get to the success that you wish to have to get to the point that really belongs to you with the potential you have and the one you can really fulfil because the most renewable energy we have is our own potential and our own passion so let's go for it and I wish you an excellent adventure in the winter the future thank you. traffic is a global epidemic traffic is creating 45% of the world's pollution in the UK time wasted in traffic cost 20

52,BeverlyJoubertandDereckJoubert_2010W.sph.wav,is probably true that's really what it needs we need it we respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman as a community and as part of this planet getting to know her that individual personality of hers and really coming to know her now i'm destined to spend a lot of time with some unique very very special individualistic and often seductive female characters clearly one of them and this little leopard legadema is another and she changed our lives well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her in fact more time than even her mother did when her mother would go off hunting we would stay and film and early on a lightning bolt hit a tree twenty paces away from us it was frightening and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell and of course we were standing for well we needn't have worried she came charging out of the thicket straight towards us sat next to us shivering with her back towards dereck and looking out and actually from that day on she's been comfortable with us so we felt that that day was the day that she really earned her name we called about the african wilderness and protecting the african wilderness and so what we've done is we've focused on which means light from the sky now we've found these individualisms in all sorts of animals in particular in the cats this particular one is called eetwidomayloh he who greets with fire and you can just see that about him you know that's his character but only by getting up close to these animals and spending time with them can we actually even reach out and dig out these personal characters that but through our investigation we have to seek the wildest places in africa and right now this is in the okavango delta in botswana yes it is swamp we live in the swamp in a tent but i must tell you everyday is exhilarating but also our hearts are in now one of the big things of course everybody knows that cats hate water and so this was a real revelation for us and we could only find this by pushing ourselves by going where no sane person should go and i know in the light of around we don't always get we seriously underestimated the depth we got deeper and deeper until it we drowned our pride i must tell you which was really serious and we seized the and of course one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who drowns the vehicle gets to swim with the crocodiles notice also that all of these images here are taken from the top angle by beverly the dry top angle all the places we get stuck in really have great views and it wasn't a moment and these lions came back towards us and beverly was able to get a great but we truly do spend day and night trying to capture unique footage and twenty years ago we did a film called eternal enemies one would it was amazing because you can see that this lion is doing exactly what his name eetwidomayloh represents he 's focused on this hyena and he is going to get it but that 's i think what this is all about is that these individuals have these personalities and characters but for us to get them not only do we push ourselves but we live by certain rules of engagement which mean we can't interfere today we're here to share with you a message that we have learned from a very important and special character this so as dereck says we have to work through extremes extreme temperatures push ourselves at night sleep deprivation on the edge through a large part of the time for ten years we tried to that it was a disturbing night for me i had tears rolling down my cheeks i was shaking with anxiety but i knew that to capture something that had never been seen before had never been documented and i do believe you should stay with us the amazing thing about these moments and this is probably a highlight of our career is that you never know how it's going to end many people believe in fact that death begins in the eyes not in the heart not in the lungs and that's when people give up hope or when any life form gives up and you can see the start of it here this elephant against overwhelming odds simply gives up well our lives have basically been like a super long episode of csi something like twenty eight years but by the same token so just when you think it's all over something else happens some spark gets into some sort of will to fight that iron will that we all have that this elephant has that conservation has that big cats have everything has that will to survive to fight to push through that mental barrier and to keep going and for us in many ways this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration for us a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our this is about couples working together and so i do need to say that within the vehicle we have quite strict territories beverly and but when this little cub saw that i had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear she came in like a curious cat to come and it was phenomenal and we felt grateful that she trusted us to that extent but at the same time we were concerned that if she created this as a habit and jumped into somebody else's car it might not turn out the same way she might get shot for that so we knew we had to react quickly and the only way we thought we could without scaring her were excited i was like watching a graduation ceremony we felt like we were surrogate parents and of course we knew now that she was going to survive but only when we saw the tiny baby baboon clinging to the mother 's fur did we realize that something very unique was taking place here with the next couple of hours was very unique it was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety protecting it from the hyena over the next five hours she took care of it we realized that we actually don't know everything and that so she was a little bit but in fact what we were seeing here was interesting because she is a wanting to play but she was also a predator needing to kill and yet conflicted in some way because she was also an emerging mother she had this maternal instinct and of course through the night they lay together they ended up sleeping for hours but i have to tell you everybody always asks what happened to the baby baboon die and we suspect it was from the freezing so at this stage i guess we had very very firm ideas on what conservation meant we had to deal with these individual personalities we had to deal with them with respect and celebrate them and so we with the national geographic formed the big cats initiative to march forward into conservation taking care of the big cats that we loved and then had an opportunity to look back over the last fifty years to see how well we had all collectively been doing so when beverly and i were born there were four hundred and fifty thousand lions and today there are twenty and then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to twelve thousand leopards have plummeted from seven hundred thousand down to fifty thousand now in the extraordinary time that we have worked with legadema which is really over a five year period ten thousand leopards were legally shot by safari hunters and that's not the only leopards that were being killed through that period the same tree that we found her mother in and her grandmother and she took us on a journey and revealed something very special to us an immense amount of poaching as well and so possibly the same amount it's simply not sustainable we admire them and we fear them we want to steal their power it used to be the time where only kings wore a leopard skin but now throughout rituals and ceremonies traditional healers and ministers and of course looking at that has been skinned it eerily reminds me of a human hand and that's ironic because their fate is in our hands a burgeoning bone trade south africa just released some lion bones onto the market lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same and so in the lion bone industry is going to wipe out all the tigers so we have a real problem here no more so than the lions the male lions so the twenty thousand lion figure you just saw is actually a red herring because there may be three or four thousand male lions and they all are actually infected with the same disease because there's a sport there's an activity going on that we're all aware of that we and you have to know that when a male lion is into the area and takes over the pride and of course first of all kills all the cubs and possibly some of the females that eight days old and the minute we found this leopard we realized that we needed to move in and so we basically stayed with this leopard for the next four so we've estimated that between twenty to thirty lions are killed when one lion is hanging on a wall somewhere in a far off place so what our investigations have shown is that these lions are essential they're essential to the habitat it they disappear whole ecosystems in africa disappear an eighty billion dollar a year eco tourism revenue stream into africa so this is not just a concern about lions it's a concern about communities in africa as well if they disappear all of that goes away but what i'm more concerned about in many ways is that as we de link ourselves from nature as we de link ourselves spiritually from these animals we so you have to know looking into the eyes of and leopards right now it is all about critical awareness and so what we are doing in february we're bringing out a film called the last and the last lion is exactly what is happening right now that is the situation we're in the last that is if we don't take action and do something these plains will be completely devoid of big cats and then in turn everything else will disappear and simply if we can't protect them we're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well and in fact that original thing that we spoke about and designed our lives by that conservation was all about respect and celebration,1,"we are truly passionate about the African Wilderness and protecting the African Wilderness and so what we've done is we've focused on iconic cats in the life of human suffering and poverty and even climate change one would wonder why worry about a few cats. quote today we share to share with you a message that we have learned from a very important and special character does leopard. well as it basically being like a super long episode of CSI something like 28 years that we've seen over 2,000 kills by these amazing animals but one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality that that individual personality that is animals. and he has a prime example we found the slip it in a 2000 year old baby between Africa and the same fee that we found another in and her grandmother and she took us on a journey and revealed something very special to us. her and daughter ate a salt and the minute we found this lipid we realize that we needed to move in and so we basically stayed with his leopard for the next four and a half years following her ever getting to know her that individual personality of hers and really coming to know her to spend a lot of time with some unique very very special individualistic and often seductive female characters. Beverly's Kelly one of them and. this little Lady Foot Locker edema is another and she changed our lives. what time then even another good wear their mother would go hunting we would stay informed and early on a lightning bolt hits at three Twenty Paces away from us it was frightening and it's showered us with leaves and the pungent smell and of course we was done for a while but when we managed to get our wits about us we looked at it doesn't take my gosh what's going to happen with that little cup Associated Stephanie crashed with us well when he's not worried she can't charging out of a second straight towards us to ask shivering with her back towards Eric and looking out and actually from that day on she's been comfortable with us. so we felt that that's a with the day that you really earned her name we called her lucky day, which means life from the sky looks of animals in particular in the cats this particular one is called in try to measure he greets with fire and you can just see that about him you know that's his character and spending time with them can we actually even reach out and dig out these personal characters that they have in the okavango delta in Botswana yes it is out of the time because we draw a sea king and searching and foaming the iconic cat. now one of the big things of course everybody knows that cats hate water and so this was a real Revelation for us and we could only find this by pushing ourselves we're going with no sane person should not without some prompting by the way from Beverly and just pushing the envelope going out there pushing pushing ourselves but we managed to find that these lines are 15% bigger than any others and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water. and then of course the challenge is knowing when to turn around we do we got until it to that Derek's Chase time well then we hit a deep depression and we seriously submerge the vehicle we actually managed to $200 with a camera gear Round Up ride I must tell you which was pretty serious and received the injured. and of course one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he drowns the vehicle gets to swim with the crocodiles. you'll notice also that all of these images were taken from the top angle by Beverly the dry mango in the moment and these lines came back towards us and David was able to get a great photograph of it. but we truly to spend day and night trying to capture unique footage and twenty years ago we did a phone called Eternal enemies where we managed to capture this unusual Disturbing Behavior across two species lines and a heinous and surprisingly it became a cold sore and we can kind of side dish side of Nature and gang Warfare you can see the line is doing exactly what he represents he's focused on the side he knows and he is going to get it. but that's not think what this is all about is that these individuals have these personalities and characters but for us to get to know that I need to refresh ourselves but we live by certain Rules of Engagement which mean we can't interfere the sort of behavior has been going on for 345 million years and we can step in and say that's wrong and that's right but that's not always easy for us. text Eric says we have to work through extreme extreme temperatures for ourselves at night sleep deprivation is Extreme we on the edge through a large part of the time but 14 years we tried to capture lions and elephants together and never ever manage until this particular line. and I have to tell you that it was a disturbing nice for me I had tears rolling down my cheeks I was shaking with anxiety but I knew that you captured something that I've never seen before had never been documented and I do believe you should stay with us. the amazing thing about these moments and this is probably a highlight of that Korea is that you never know how it's going to end. many people believe in fact that this begins in the eyes not in the heart's not in the lungs and that's when people give up hope for when any life-form gives up hope and you can see the start of here. this elephant against overwhelming odds simply gives up hope. but all the same token. you can get you her back again. so just when you think it's all over this something else happened some spot gets into you some sort of will to fight that that on will that we all have that this elephant has that conservation has that big cats have everything has that will to survive to fight to push through that mental barrier and to keep going. and for us in many ways this elephant is becoming a symbol of inspiration for us the symbol of that hurt as we go forward in our work. come back to the leopard we're spending so much time with us later than getting to understand or individualism her personal character that maybe we were taking it a little bit taking her for granted and maybe she didn't like that that much this is about couples working together and so I do need to say that within the vehicle we have clots pick territories Beverly or not family sits on the one side with all their cameras and I'm on the other side with a bit more space is precious to us these device located my seat and climb to the back to get some camera gear she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate it was phenomenal and we felt grateful that she trusted us to that extent but at the same time we were concerned that if she created this as a heaven and jump into somebody else's car it smart not to not to stay where she might catch up for that so we knew we. had to react quickly and the only way before we could is without scaring her is to trying to stimulate to growl like a mother would make a hissing sound but they're turned on the heat in the car very Innovative any way for me to save the marriage goes baby feels she's being replaced. but really and truly this was how this little leopard was displaying her individual personality but nothing prepared us for what happened next in a relationship with her when she started an enormous the first time that we truly were excited was like watching a graduation ceremony we felt like we was Sarah good parents and of course we knew now that she was going to survive but we saw the tiny baby boo Boon keng into the mother's food did we realize that something very unique was taking place with La Cadena and of course it didn't turn and run. so what we watched over the next couple of hours with very unique. it was absolutely amazing which you picked it up at 2 safety protecting us from the the hyena. and over the next five hours she took care of it we realized that we actually don't know everything and that nature is so unpredictable we have to be open at all times. okay so she was a little bit rough. wedding fact. what we missing here was interesting because she is a cub wanting to play but she was also Predator needing to kill and yet conflicted in some way because she was also emerging mother she had this maternal Instinct much like a young girl on her way to Womanhood this really took us to this new level of understanding that personality. and of course through the night they laid together they ended up sleeping for hours but I have to tell you everybody always ask what happened to the baby Boon it's at die and we suspect it was from the freezing winter night. so at this stage I guess that we had very very firm ideas on what conservation meant we had to deal with these individual personalities way to deal with them with respect and celebrating and so we we with a National Geographic from the big cats initiative to March forward into conservation taking care of the big cats that we love and then had an opportunity to look back over the last 50 years to see how well we all collectively been doing so in 50,000 lines and today they 20,000. Tyga 7 fit any better 45,000 down two maybe three thousand from 700000 down to a mere fifty thousand times that we've worked with like a deal. Ten thousand leopards legally shop by Safari hunters kill to that. There's an immense amount of poaching as well and to possibly the same amount something off stainable we admire them and we fear them. and yes as man we want to steal their power. it used to be the time where any Kings war and epic skin but now throughout rituals and ceremonies traditional healers and ministers and of course looking at this line pool that is being skinned it reminds me of a human hands and that's ironic because they faces in our hands release timeline burns on to the market and bones and tiger bones look exactly the same and so in this truck the line burning the street is going to wipe out all the Tigers we have a real problem here no more so than the male line so the 20,000 line figure that you just saw was actually a red herring because they may be three or four thousand mail on Sunday ol actually infected with the same disease I call it complacency. call complacency because it's a sport there's an activity going on that we're all aware of that we condone. and that's probably because we haven't seen it like we are today. and you have to know that when a male line is killed it completely disrupt the whole pride and you mail comes into the area and takes over the pride and of course Festival killed all the Cubs and possibly some of the female that the defendant make up the weave is tomato that between 20 to 30 lines or killed when one line is hanging on a wall somewhere in a foreign place so what are African disappear is an 80 billion dollars a year ecotourism Revenue stream into Africa so this is not just a concern about land as well. if they disappear all of that goes away but what I'm more concerned about in many ways is that as we dalinka sounds from nature as we did link yourself spiritually from these animals we. we lose hope we don't lose that that spiritual connection now dignity that thing within us that keeps us connected to the planet of lions and leopards right now it is all about critical awareness and so what we are doing in February bringing out a phone call the last time and exactly what is happening right now that is a situation we in the Lost land that if we don't take action and do something these planes will be completely devoid of big Cass and then he's tuned everything else will disappear and simply if we can protect them we got to have a job protecting ourselves as well and design dialogues by the conservation was all about respect and celebration is probably true that's really what it needs we needed with respect and celebrate each other as a. a man and a woman as a community and it's part of this planet and we need to continue that well we can report in fact that we're grandparents. thank you very much.

53,BillClinton_2007.sph.wav,of of the the less than three tenths of one percent about forty percent of all the a the fact that that for those of on for in to save as many lives as quickly as we can but to do it in in to a on them to help this it and a of a couple of in the united were more important than public the of try to to to that would to with me and i want to it five hundred dollars first week we were working we got the price down to five hundred dollars of the and a low margin the i we can't do this or the other thing in poor countries in to to a in in of in haiti and that we're and the and put the full resources of the government the in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of is,1,"I thought in getting up to my Ted wish. I will try to begin by putting in perspective. what I try to do and how it fits with what they try to do. we live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent but insufficient. in three major ways it is first of all profoundly unequal. half the world's people still living on less than $2 a day been in people with no access to clean water two and a half bed in no access to sanitation the bed and going to bed hungry every night one in four deaths every year from AIDS TV malaria and the variety of infections associated with dirty water 80% of them under 5 years of age. even in wealthy countries. it is, now to see any quality growing in the United States since 2001 we've had five years of economic growth five years of productivity growth in the workplace but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of Working Families dropping below the poverty line is up by 4% the percentage of Working Families without Healthcare up by 4%. so this Skinner dependent World which has been pretty good to most of us which is why we're all here in Northern California doing what we do for a living enjoying this evening is profoundly unequal. it is all so unstable. unstable because of the threats of. Terror weapons of mass destruction the spread of global disease. in a sense that we are vulnerable to it in a way that we weren't not so many years ago. and perhaps most important of all that is unsustainable because of climate change resource depletion and species destruction. when I think about the world I would like to leave to my daughter and my grandchildren I hope to have. it is a world that moves. away from unequal unstable unsustainable interdependence to integrated communities locally nationally and globally that share the characteristics of all successful Community broadly shared accessible set of opportunities. a shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common Enterprise and a genuine sense of belonging. all easier said than done. when the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom couple of years ago I think even though they didn't claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on 9/11 I think the thing that troubled the British most was that the perpetrators were not Invaders but homegrown citizens. whose religious and political identities were more important to them than the people that grew up with went to school with work with shared weekends with shared meals with. in other words they thought their differences were more important than their common Humanity. it is the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century. end of this mix People Like Us who are not in public office have more power to do good than at any time in history. because more than half the world's people live under governments they vote it in and can vote out and even non democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion. because. primarily of the power of the internet people of modest means can band together and a mass of vast sums of money that can change the world for some public good if they all agree. when the tsunami hit South Asia the United States contributed 1.2 billion dollars 30% of our households gave half of them gave over the internet. the median contribution was somewhere around $57. and thirdly because of the rise of non-governmental organizations. they businesses other citizens groups have enormous power to affect the lives of our fellow human beings. when I became president in 1993 there were none of these organizations in Russia there are now a couple hundred thousand nine in India there now at least a half a million active none in China there now 250,000 register with the government probably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons. when I organize my Foundation. and I thought about the world as it is in the world that I. hope to leave to the Next Generation. and I try to be realistic about. what I had cared about all my life that I can still have an impact on. I wanted to focus on activities that would help to. alleviate poverty fight disease combat climate change Bridges the religious racial and other divides that torment the world but to do it in a way that would either use whatever particular skills we could put together in our group. to change the way. some public good function was performed so that would sweep across the world more you saw one reference to that. in what we were able to do with AIDS drugs and I I want to say that the head of our aides effort and the person who also is primarily active in the wish I'll make tonight our magazine is here with me and I want to thank him for everything he's done but we could he's over here. when I got out of office and was asked to work first in the Caribbean to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis. generic drugs were available for about $500 a person a year if you bought them in the bass box you could get them at a little under $400 first country we went to work in the Bahamas was paying $3,500 for these drugs the market was so terribly disorganized that they were buying this medicine through two agents who were gigging them Sevenfold. to the very first week waiting for working we got the price down to $500 and all the sudden they could save seven times and they live so the same amount of money. then we went to work with the manufacturers of age medicines one of them was sighted in the film. and negotiated a whole different changing business strategy because even at $500 these drugs were being sold on the high-margin low-volume uncertain payment basis so we worked on improving the productivity of the operations in the supply chain and went to a low-margin high-volume absolutely certain payment business I joked it it's the main contribution we made in the battle against aids with to get the manufacturers to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy. but price went to $140 from 540 soon the average price was $192 now we can get it for about $100 children's medicine was $600 because nobody could afford to buy any of it we negotiated it down to 190 then the French impose their brilliantly conceived Airline tax to create a something called unitaid got a bunch of other countries to help a children's medicine is now $60 a person a year. the only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives of everybody who needs a medicine stay alive or the absence of systems necessary to diagnose treat and care for people in the liver this mess. we started a childhood obesity initiative with a Heart Association American we try to do the same thing by negotiating industry ride deals with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric another dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools we just reorganize the markets and it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental World somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets. and that is now what we're trying to do and working with this large cities group to fight climate change to negotiate huge big volume deals that will enable cities which generates 75% of the world's greenhouse gases to drastically and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a way that is good economics. and this whole discussion is if it's a some sort of economic burden is a mystery to me I think it's a bird's nest on the ground. when Al Gore won his well-deserved Oscar for them Inconvenient Truth movie I was thrilled but I had urged him to make a second movie quickly for those of you who saw An Inconvenient Truth. the most important. slide in the gore lecture is the last one which shows here's where the greenhouse gases are going if we don't do anything here's where they could go and then there are six different categories of things we can do to change the trajectory we need a movie on those six categories and all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize ourselves around it so we're trying to do that. so organizing these markets is one thing we try to do. now we have taken on a second thing and this gets to my wish it has been my experience in working in developing countries. that while the headlines may all be he's with the pessimistic headlines may say well we can't do this at the other thing because of corruption. I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption. and fees corruption. we now have the money given these low prices to distribute AIDS drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach. today these low prices are available in the 25 countries where we work and then a total of 62 countries in about 550,000 people are getting the benefits of them. but the money is there to reach others the systems are not there to reach the people. so what we have been trying to do. working first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places but I want to talk about Rwanda tonight. is to develop a model. for real Health Care in a very poor area that can be used to do with a TV malaria other infectious diseases maternal and child health the whole range of health issues for people are grappling with in the developing world that can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda and then we'll be a model that could literally be implemented in any other four country in the world and the test is one will it do the job will develop provide high-quality care and to will it do it at a price that will enable the country to sustain the healthcare system without foreign donors after 5 to 10 years. because of the longer I deal with these problems and more convinced I am that we have to whether it's economics health education whatever we have to build systems and the absence of systems that function. break the connection which got you all in this sea tonight you think about whatever your life has been however many obstacles you have faced in your life at critical junctures you always knew there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted and the results you achieved. in a world with no systems with chaos everything becomes a gorilla struggle. and thus predictability is not there and it becomes almost impossible to save lives educate kids develop economies whatever. the person in my view who has done the best job of this. in the healthcare area of building a system in a very poor area is Doctor Paul Farmer who many of you know his work for now 20 years. with his group Partners in Health. primarily in Haiti where he started but they'll also working Russia and Peru and other places around the world. his poor is Haiti is in the area where Farmers Clinic is active and they serve a catchment area far greater than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve since 1988 they are not lost one person to tuberculosis. not one. and they've achieved a lot of other amazing health results. so when we decided to work in Rwanda on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country in 5th problem we wanted to build a healthcare Network cuz it have been totally destroyed during the genocide in 1994 and a cap and I'm kind of still under a dollar a day. so I ran I asked Paul Farmer if he would help. because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti and a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country. number one it would be a wonderful thing for a country that has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last 15 years and number two we would have something that they could then be adapted to any other poor country anywhere in the world. and so we have set about doing that now. we started working together 18 months ago. and we're working in an area called Southern kion's of which is one of the poorest areas in Rwanda with a group that originally includes about 400,000 people. we are essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti we he develops and trains. paid community health workers. who are able to identify health problems. ensure that people who have AIDS or TV or properly diagnose and take their medicine regularly. who work on bringing about health education clean water and sanitation providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of healthcare if they have problems of the severity that requirement. the procedures that make this work have been perfected as I said by Paul Farmer and his team and they're working real Haiti over the last 20 years. recently we did an evaluation of the first 18 months of our efforts in Rwanda. and the results were so good that the Rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country and is strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it. I'll tell you a little bit about our team because it's indicative of what we do we have about 500 people around the world working in our age program. some of them for nothing just for transportation room and board and then we have others working in these other related programs our business planning Rwanda was put together under the leadership of Diana Noble who is an unusually gifted woman but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work she was the youngest partner is shorter ventures in London in our twenties she was CEO of a successfully Ventures she started and built Reed elsevier Ventures and it 45 she decided she wanted to do something different with her life so she now works full-time on this for very little pay. she and her team of former business people have created a business plan that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country. and it would be worthy of the kind of private Equity work she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it. when we came to this rule area 45% of the children under the age of five has stunted growth due to malnutrition. 23% of them died before they reach the age of 5. mortality at Birth was over two and a half percent over 15% of the deaths among adults and children occur because of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation all entirely preventable and treatable. over 13% of the desk or from respiratory illnesses again all preventable and treatable and not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis. within the first 18 months the following things happen we went from 0 to about 2,000 people being treated for AIDS that's 80% of the people who need treatment in this area. listen to this less than four tenths of 1% of those being treated stop taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment that's lower than the figure in the United States less than three tenths of 1% had to transfer to the more expensive second line drugs. 400000 pregnant women were brought into counseling and will give birth for the first time within an organized Healthcare System. that's about 43% of all the pregnancies. about 40% of all the people that died said foreign time in 40,000 about 40% of all the people who need TV treatment or now getting it and just 18 months up from zero when we started. 43% of the children in need of an infant feeding program prevent malnutrition in early death are now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive in the grow. we started the first malaria treatment program slip ever had their. patient admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide that we have renovated. along with four other clinics complete with solar power generators good lab technology we now or treating 325 people a month. despite the fact that almost 100% of the AIDS patients are now treated at home. and the most important thing. is the cause we've implemented Paul Farmers model using community health workers we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda 4 between 5 and 6 per cent of GDP. and that the government could sustain that without depending on foreign aid after five or six years. for those of you understand Healthcare economics you know that all wealthy countries spend between 9 and 11 per cent of GDP on health care except for the United States we spend 16 but that's a story for another day. we're now working with Partners in Health in the Ministry of Health in Rwanda and now Foundation folks to scale this system up. we are also beginning to do this and Malawi and the Sue to. and we have similar projects in Tanzania and Mozambique Kenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing to save as many lives as quickly as we can but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented Nationwide and then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world we need initial upfront investment to train doctors nurses health administration at community health workers throughout the country to set up the information technology the solar energy the water and sanitation the transportation infrastructure but over a five to 10-year. We will take down the need for outside assistance and eventually it will be phased out. my wish. is that Ted assist us in our work and help us to build a high-quality real health system in a poor country Rwanda they can be a model for Africa and indeed for any poor country anywhere in the world. my belief. is that this will help us to build a more integrated world with more partners and fewer terrorist. with more productive citizens and fewer haters a place we all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up in. it has been an honor for me particularly. to work in Rwanda where we also have a major economic development project in partnership with the Tom Hunter of the Scottish philanthropist where last year we using the same thing with 8 rows cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on micro-credit loans by 30% and achieved three to four hundred percent increases in crop yields with the farmers. these people have been through a lot and none of us most of all me helped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other. we're on doing that now and they are so over it and so into their future. we're doing this in an environmentally responsible way I'm doing my best to convince them not to run the Electric good to the 35% of the people that have no access but to do it with clean energy. they have responsible reforestation projects the rwandans interesting Lee enough have been quite good mr. Wilson and preserving their topsoil. the decision a couple of guys from Southern farming families the first thing I did when I went out to this place was to get on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt and see what they done with it. we have a chance here. to prove that a country that almost slaughtered itself out of existence. can practice reconciliation. reorganize itself focus on tomorrow. and provide comprehensive Quality Healthcare with minimal outside help. I am grateful for this price. and I will use it to that end. we could use some more help to do this but think of what it would mean if we could have a world-class health system in Rwanda in a country with less than $1 a day per capita income. one that could save hundreds of millions of lives over the next decade if applied to every Sun Ali situated country on Earth. it's worth a try and I believe it would succeed thank you and God bless you",0.59765625,
54,BillDavenhall_2009P.sph.wav,but this part of the equation i didn't really get and i don't think my physicians really get this part of the equation what does that mean my environment well it can mean a lot of things this is my life these are my life places we all have these while i'm talking i'd like you to also be thinking about how many places have you lived just think about that you know wander through your life thinking about this and you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places you spend it at rest and you spend it at work and if you're like me you're in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place so it's not really simple when somebody asks you where do you live where do you work and where do you spend all your time and where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don't even see well when i have done this on myself i always come to the conclusion that i spend about seventy five percent of my time and i don't wander far from that place for a majority of my time even though i'm an extensive global trekker can geographic information but this is where i spent my first nineteen years with my little young lungs you know breathing high concentrations here of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and methane gas in unequal quantities nineteen years of this and if you've been in that part of the country this is what those piles of burning smoldering coal waste look like make you healthy so then i decided to leave that part of the world and i was going to go to the mid west okay so i ended up in louisville kentucky well i decided to be neighbors to a place called they manufacture plastics they use large quantities chloroprene and benzene okay i spent twenty five years in my middle age lungs now in two thousand and one i got hit by a train it it was insidious and it was really happening and then i decided i had to get really smart i would take this job in the west coast and i moved to redlands california very nice and there my older senior lungs as i like to call them i filled with particulate matter carbon dioxide and very high does of ozone well the picture is there is a huge gap here the one thing that never happens in my doctor 's office they never ask me about my place history my train was a heart attack doctor can i remember ever asking me asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that i put in my mouth or the food that i ingest into my stomach they really don't do that it's missing look at the kind of data that is available i found myself in a hospital in an intensive care ward so how many people are in the white how many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space anybody boy you're lucky how many have spent it in the red places not so lucky some sense of what's going to be our train wreck but none of that is in my medical record and it's not in yours either recuperating from emergency surgery and i suddenly realized something that i was completely in the dark so here is my friend paul he 's a colleague he allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours twenty four seven three hundred and sixty five days out of the year for the last two years everywhere he and you can see he 's been to a few places around the united states and this is where he has spent most of his time if you really studied that you might have some clues as to what paul likes to do anybody got any clues skiing right we can zoom in here and we suddenly see now we see where paul has really spent a majority of his time and all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the did you know that data existed for every community in the united states you could have your own personalized map of that our cellphones can now build a place history this is how paul did it he did it with his iphone this might be what we end up with this is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room i started asking my questions well why me why now why here could my doctor have warned me so what i want to do here in the few minutes i have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health i suggest that maybe you not decide just because you're out here in beautiful california and it's warm every day that you get out and run at six o'clock at night i'd suggest that that's a bad idea bill because of this report what i'd like to leave you for are two prescriptions okay number one is we must teach physicians about the value of geographical information it's called geomedicine there are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this and they're in the early stages of development these programs need to be supported and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information i've shared here with you today the second thing we need to do is while we're spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record will also be useful for us with that i would like to just say that jack lord said this almost ten years ago just look at that for a minute that was what the conclusion of the dartmouth atlas of healthcare was about with saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease in illness in wellness and how our healthcare system actually operates that was what he was talking about on that quote and i would say he got it right almost a decade ago so i'd very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records so with that i'll leave you that in my particular view of view of health geography always matters and i believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy thank you well i understand the genetics and lifestyle part and you know why i understand that because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this you ever had to fill out those long legal size forms in your doctor 's office i mean if you're lucky enough you get to do it more than once right do it over and over again and they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history your medication history your surgical history your allergy history did i forget any history,1,can geographic information make you healthy. in 2001 I got hit by a train. my train was a heart attack I found myself in a hospital and in intensive care Ward recuperating from emergency surgery and I suddenly realized something that I was completely in the dark. I started asking my questions well why me why now why here could my doctor have warned me so what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health genetics lifestyle and environment that's going to sort of container risks and if we manage those wrist we're going to live a good life and a good healthy life well I understand the genetics and lifestyle part and you know why I understand that because my Physicians constantly ask me questions about this have you ever had to fill out those long legal size forms in your doctor's office I mean if you're lucky enough to get it to do it more than once right do it over and over again and they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history your medication history your surgical history at your allergy history did I forget any history. but this part of the equation I didn't really get and I don't think my Physicians really get this part of the equation what does that mean my environment well can mean a lot of things this is my life these are my life places we all have these while I'm talking I'd like you to also be thinking about how many places have you lived. just think about that and you don't wander through year your life thinking about this and you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places you spend it rest and you spend it at work and if you're like me you're in Airplane a good portion of your time traveling someplace so it's not really simple when somebody asks you where do you live where do you work and where do you spend all your time and where do you expose yourself to risk that maybe perhaps you don't even see. well when I have done this on myself I always come to the conclusion that I spend about 75% of my time relatively no small number of places and I don't wander far from that place for a majority of my time even though I'm an extensive Global tracker. I'm going to take you on a little journey here I started off in Scranton Pennsylvania I don't know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania but this is where my spent my first 19 years with my little young love you know breathing high concentrations hear of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and methane gas and unequal quantities 19 years of this and if you've been in that part of the country this is what those piles of burning smoldering cold waste look like so then I decided to leave that part of the world and I was going to go to the Midwest okay so I ended up in Louisville Kentucky Well I decided to be neighbors to a place called rubbertown they manufacture Plastics they use large quantities chloroprene and Benzene okay I spent 25 years in my middle-aged Long's now. breathing various concentrations of that and on a clear day at always look like this so you never saw it it was Insidious and it was really happening and then I decided I could get really smart I would take this job in the west coast and I moved to Redlands California very nice and they're my older senior lungs as I like to call him I filled with particulate matter carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone pay almost the highest in the nation right this is what it looks like on a good day if you've been there you know what I'm talking about so what's wrong with this picture. well the picture is there's a huge gap here the one thing that never happens in my doctor's office they never asked me about my place history no doctor can I remember ever asking me where have you lived they haven't asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that I put in my mouth or the food that I ingest in my stomach they really don't do that it's missing look at the kind of day that it's available. this data is from all over the world countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research not I circled the places where I've been well by Design if I wanted to have a heart attack I've been in the right places. right. so how many people are in the White House many people in the room is spent the majority of their life in the whitespace anybody boy you're lucky how many of spending in the red places. oh not so lucky there are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in Atlas has all over the world that give is some sense of what's going to be the R Train Wreck but none of that's in my medical record and it's not in yours either. so here's my friend Paul he's a colleague he allowed his cellphone to be tracked every 2 hours 24 7 365 days out of the year for the last two years are everywhere he went and you can see he's been in a few places around the United States and this is where he has spent most of his time. if you really study that you you might have some Clues as to what Paul likes to do anybody got any clues Ski-Doo we can zoom in here and we suddenly see that now we see where Paul his really spend the majority of his time and all those black dots are all of the Toxic release inventories that are monitored by the EPA did you know that data existed for every community in the United States you can have your own personalized map of that it's our cell phones can now build a place history this is how Paul did he did it with his iPhone this might be what we end up with this is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter right this could be my little assessment and it looks at that nice has Bill. I suggest that maybe you not decide just because you're out here in beautiful California and it's warm every day that you get out and run at 6 at night I'd suggested that a bad idea bill. because of this report. what I like to leave you for two prescriptions okay number one is we must teach Physicians about the value of geographical information it's called Geo Madison there's about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this and they're in the early stages of development these programs need to be supported and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information I've shared here with you today the second thing we need to do is why we're spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world golden electronic health record we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record. it not only will value the food be important for the position will be important for the researchers that now will have huge samples to draw pain but a loss would be useful for us I could have made the decision if I had this information not to move to the ozone capital of the United States could night I could make that decision or I could negotiate with my employer to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company. with that I would like to just say the Jack Lord said this almost 10 years ago just look at that for a minute. that was what the conclusion of the Dartmouth atlas of healthcare was about was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease and illness and wellness and how our Healthcare System actually operates that was what the he was talking about on that on that the quote and I would say he got it right almost a decade ago so I'd very much like to see us begin to really sees this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records in my particular view of Hell geography always matters and I believe the geographic information can make both you and me very healthy thank you,0.79296875,
55,BillGates_2009.sph.wav,first of all there's a lot more testing going on and that's given us the picture of where we are and that allows us to understand that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis is very practical in all public schools and so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say ok here 's a little clip of something i thought i did well little clip of something i think i did poorly advise me when this kid acted up how should i have dealt with that and they could all sit and work together on those problems you can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff you can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course learn from that if you have a kid who 's behind you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept and in fact these free courses could not only be available just on the internet but you could make it so that dvds were always so that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate it's a phenomenal thing each one of those lives matters a lot available and so anybody who has access to a dvd player can have the very best teachers and so by thinking of this as a personnel system we can do it much better and i thought it was so fantastic it gave you a sense of what a good teacher does i'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book i really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have in fact we have in the stimulus bill it's interesting the house version actually had money in it for these data systems and it was taken out in the senate because there are people who are threatened by these things but i i'm optimistic i think people are beginning to recognize how important this is and it really can make a difference for millions of lives if we get it right only had time to frame those two problems there's a lot more problems like that see you're getting excited just at the very name of these things and the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad you know the system doesn't naturally make it happen governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way the private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things so it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things get other people involved and the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs vaccines that were used more widely and you're helping to come up with solutions and with that i think there's some great things that will come out of it well under twenty years why well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths diarrhea pneumonia last week talking about the work of the foundation sharing some of the problems and warren buffet had recommended i do that being honest about what was going well what wasn 't and making it kind of an annual thing actually peaked at a bit over five million in the nineteen thirties so it was absolutely gigantic and the disease was all over the world a terrible disease it was in the united states it was in europe people didn't know what caused it until the early nineteen hundreds when a british military man figured out that it was mosquitoes so it was everywhere two tools helped bring the death rate down one was killing the mosquitoes with ddt the other was treating the patients with quinine or quinine derivatives and so that's why the death rate did come down and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries it doesn't get much investment for example there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria now baldness it's a terrible and rich men are afflicted and so that's why that priority has been set but malaria even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact over two hundred million people at any one time are suffering from it it means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much a goal i had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems because i think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally that is the market does not drive now malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitoes i brought some here just so you could experience this we'll let those roam around the the those mosquitoes are not infected so we've come up with a few new things we've got bed nets and bed nets are a great tool what it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night so the mosquitoes that bite late at night can't get at them and when you use indoor spraying with ddt and those nets you can cut deaths by over fifty percent and that's happened now in a number of countries it's great to see but we have to be careful because malaria and so you end up with two choices if you go into a country with the right tools and the right way you do it vigorously you can actually get a local eradication and that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking or if you go in kind of half heartedly for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden but eventually those tools will become ineffective and the death rate will soar back up again and the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention now we're on the upswing bed net funding is up there's new drug discovery going on our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months over two thirds of the lives if it's effective so we're going to have these new tools but that alone doesn't give us the road map the scientists the communicators the thinkers the governments to do the right things and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care it involves social scientists so we know how to get not just seventy percent of the people to use the bed nets but ninety percent we need mathematicians to come in and simulate this to do monte carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise we need rich world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things and so as these elements come together i'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria let me turn to a second question a fairly different question but i'd say equally important and this is how do you make a teacher great let 's start with why this is important well all of us here i'll bet had some great teachers we all had a wonderful education that's part of the reason we're here today part of the reason we're successful i can say that even though i'm a college drop out i had great teachers in fact in the united states the teaching system has worked fairly well there are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places so the top twenty percent of students have gotten a good education and those top twenty percent have been the best in the world if you measure them against the other top twenty percent and they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the u s at the forefront now the strength for those top twenty percent is starting to fade on a relative basis but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to so this morning i'm going to share two of these problems and talk about not only has that been weak it's getting weaker and if you look at the economy it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education and we have to change this we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity we have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education like science and mathematics when i first learned the statistics i was pretty stunned at how bad things are over thirty percent of kids never finish high school and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and the stated dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over thirty percent for minority kids it's over fifty percent and even if you graduate from high school if you're low income you have less than a twenty five percent chance of ever completing a college degree if you're low income in the united states you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four year degree and that doesn't seem entirely fair so how do you make education better our foundation for the last nine years has invested in this there's many people working on it we've worked on small schools we've funded scholarships we've done things in libraries a lot of these things had a good effect but before i dive into those i want to admit that i am an optimist any tough problem i think it can be solved but the more we looked at it the more we realized having great teachers was the very key thing and we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers between say the top quartile the very best and the bottom how much variation is there within a school or between schools and the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable a top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class based on test scores by over ten percent in a single year what does that mean that means that if the entire u s for two years had top quartile teachers the entire difference between us and asia would go away within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away so it's simple all you need are those top quartile teachers and so you'd say wow we should reward those people we should retain those people we should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people but i can tell you that absolutely is not happening today part of the reason i feel that way is looking at the past you might think these are people with master 's degrees they've gone back and they've gotten their master 's of education this chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality that bottom thing which says there's no effect at all is a master 's degree over the past century average lifespan has more than doubled now the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded one is seniority because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension the second is but it in no way is associated with being a better teacher teach for america slight effect for math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect but overwhelmingly it's your past performance there are some people who are very good at this and we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it to raise the average capability or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system another statistic perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths now there are a few places very few where great teachers are being made a good example of one is a set of charter schools called kipp kipp means knowledge is power it's an unbelievable thing they have sixty six schools mostly middle schools some high schools and what goes on is great teaching they take the poorest kids and over ninety six percent of their high school graduates go to four year colleges and the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different in the normal public schools they're team teaching they're constantly improving their teachers they're taking data the test scores and saying to a teacher hey you caused this amount of increase they're deeply engaged in making teaching better actually go and sit in one of these classrooms at first it's very bizarre i sat down and i thought what is going on the teacher was running around and the energy level was high i thought i 'm in the sports rally or something what's going on and the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention which kids were bored and calling kids rapidly putting things up on the board it was a very dynamic environment because particularly in those middle school years fifth through eighth grade keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who a normal school teachers how good they are the data isn't gathered in the teacher 's contract it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom sometimes to once per year and they need advanced notice to do that so imagine running a factory where you've got these workers some of them just making crap and the management is told hey you can only come down here once a year but you need to let us know because we might actually fool you and try and do a good job in that one brief moment even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it they don't have the test scores and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data for example new york passed a law five years ago one hundred and thirty five million children were born so more and less than ten million of them died before the age of five that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachers but i'm optimistic about this i think there are some clear things we can do,1,"I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation Sharon some of the problems and Warren Buffett had recommended I do that being honest about what was going well what was and making it kind of an annual thing a goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally that is the market does not drive the scientist the communicators the thinkers the government's to do the right things and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and other people in can we make as much progress as we need to. so this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand but before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist any problem I think it can be solved and part of the reason I I feel that way is looking at the past over the last century average life span is more than doubled another statistic perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths as recently as 1960 110 million children were born and 20 million of those died before the age of 55 years ago 135 million children were born so more and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five so that's a factor to reduction in the child to death rate it's a phenomenal things I mean each one of those lives matters a lot. and the key reason we were able to do it I was not only Rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs vaccines that were used more widely for example measles was four million of the deaths back as recently as 1990 and now is under 400,000 who we really can make changes the next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again and I think that's doable in well under 20 years why there's only a few diseases they account for the vast majority of those deaths diarrhea pneumonia. and malaria and that brings us to the 1st problem at all I'll raise this morning which is how do we stop a disease a deadly disease that spread by mosquitoes. what's the history of this disease it's been a severe disease for thousands of years in fact we look at the genetic code it's the only disease we can see the people who lived in Africa actually bought several things to avoid malarial deaths. that's actually Pete had a bit over 5 million in the 1930s so it was absolutely gigantic and the disease was all over the world terrible disease it was in the United States was in Europe people didn't know what caused it until the early 1900's when I'm British military man figured out that it was mosquitoes it was everywhere to tools help bring the death rate down one was killing the mosquitoes with DDT and the other was treating the patients with quinine or quinine derivatives and so that's why the death rate did come down now ironically what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones which is where all the rich countries are so we can see 1970 where 1945 still most places 1970 the US and most of Europe have got rid of it 1990 you've gotten. most of the Northern areas and then more recently you can see it's just around the equator and to this leads to the Paradox that because the disease is only in the poor countries it doesn't get much investment for example there's more money put into baldness drugs that are put into malaria now Paul this is a terrible thing and rich men are afflicted and so that's why that priority. has been sacked but malaria they even the million deaths a year are caused by Mi area greatly understated impact over 200 million people at any one time or suffering from it that means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because others just it holds things back so much, Larry's first transmitted by mosquitoes and I brought some here so you could experience this will let my pills roam around the. auditorium little bit. there is no reason only poor people should have to have the insurance. not those mosquitoes are not not infected but. show me come up with a few new things we've got bed nets and bed net for a great tool what it means is the mother and child stay in the bed mad at night and so the mosquitoes bite late at night I can't get at them and when you use indoor sprain with DDT and those Nets you can cut deaths by over 50% and that's happened on the number of countries it's great to see but we have to be careful because malaria parasite involves and the mosquito evolves to every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective and Sia end up with two choices if you go into a country with the right tools in the right way and you do it vigorously you can actually get a local eradication and that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking or if you go in kind of half-heartedly for a. Of time. reduce the disease burden but eventually those tools will become ineffective in the death rate will sore back up again and the world is gone through this paid attention and then didn't pay attention now we're on the upswing. bed net funding is up there new drug Discovery going on our foundation is back to vaccine that's going into phase 3 trial that starts in a couple months and that should save over two-thirds lives if it's effective and sore going to have these new tools but that alone doesn't give us the roadmap cuz the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things and involves communicators to keep the funding I'd keep the visibility hi to tell the success stories in above social scientist do we know how to get not just 70% of people use the bed nets but ninety percent are we need mathematicians coming in simulate this to Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together ofcourse we need drug companies to give us their expertise we need Rich World governments to be very generous and in providing aid for these things and so is these elements come together. I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria. well let me turn to a second question really different question but I'd say equally important and this is how do you make a teacher great that seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on and that we'd understand very well and the answer is really that we don't. let's start with why this is important. well all of us here I'll bet had some great features and we all had a wonderful education that's part of the reason we're here today part of the reason we're successful I can say that even though I'm a College Dropout I had great teachers and in fact in the United States the teaching system is work fairly well there are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places so the top 20% of students have gotten a good education and those top 20% have been the best in the world if you measure them against the other top 20% and they've gone on to create the Revolutions in software and and biotechnology and keep the us at the Forefront now the strength for those top 20% is starting to fade on a relative basis but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting. not only is that Ben week it's getting weaker and if you look at the economy it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education and we have to change this we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity we have to change it so that the country's strong and and stays in the Forefront of things that are are driven by Advanced education like Science and Mathematics. when I first learned the statistics I was pretty stunned at how bad things are over 30% of kids never finished high school and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate is the number who started and Senior year and and then compared to the number of the penny senior year because they were tracking where the kids were before that but most of the dropouts and take him place before that so they had to raise the state of dropout rate as soon as that practice was done to over 30% for minority kids it's over 50%. and even if you graduate from high school. if you're low income you have less than a 25% chance of ever complaining a college degree if you're low income in the United States you have a higher chance of going to jail then you do with getting a four-year degree. and that you know doesn't seem entirely fair so how do you make education better our foundation for the last nine years is invested in this there's many people working on it now we worked on small schools are we funded scholarships we've done things in libraries a lot of these things had a good effect but the more we looked at it the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing until we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers between save the top quartile the very best in the bottom quartile how much variation is there within a school or between schools and the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable a top-quartile teacher. will increase the performance of their class based on test scores by over 10% in a single year what does that mean well that means that the entire us 42 years had top quartile teachers the entire difference between us and Asia would go away and within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world the way so it's simple all you need is those top-quartile teachers until you'd say well wow that's good we should reward those people we should retain those people we should find out what they're doing and Prancer that's guilt other people but I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today. what are the characteristics of this top Court found what what are they they look like you might think will these must be very senior teachers and the answer is no one somebody is taught for three years they are teaching quality does not change their after the variation is very very small he might think these are people with master's degrees they've gone back and they've got their masters of education this chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality that bottom thing with says there's no effect at all is a master's degree. now the way the pee system works is there two things are rewarded 12 seniority as your pay goes up and you got some your pension in the second is given extra money do people get their master's degree but it in no way to associated with being a better teacher Teach for America slight effect for Math teachers majoring in math U see a measurable effect but overwhelmingly. it's your past performance there are some people who are very good at this and we've done almost nothing to study what that is and a Draught in replicated to raise the average capability or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system you might say will do the good teachers stay in the Bad Teachers leave the answer is on average to slightly better teachers leave the system and it's a system with very high turnover has very few where great teachers are being made a good example one is a set of charter schools called kept hid means knowledge is power it's an unbelievable thing that 66 schools mostly Middle School 7 high schools and what goes on he's great at teaching they take the poor kids and over 96% of their high school graduates go to for your call. and the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the Normal Public School their team teaching they're constantly improving their teachers they're taking day that the task force and sandwich eater hate you cause this amount of increase until they're deeply engaged in making teaching better we actually go in and sit in one of these classrooms at first it's very bizarre I sat down and I thought what is going on the teacher was running around and the energy energy levels I thought while I'm in the prep that the sports Rally or something what's going on in the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention which kids were bored and calling on kids rapidly putting things up on the board it was a very Dynamic environment because he knows Middle School years fifth through eighth grade keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention nobody gets made fun of it or have the position of another key. who who doesn't want to be there everybody needs to be involved and so Kip is doing it. how does that compare to a normal school in a normal school teachers are told how good they are the data isn't gathered in the teacher's contract limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom sometimes to once per year and then they need advance notice to do that so mad and running the factory we've got these work some of them just making crap and the management has told her you can only come down here once to hear but you need to let us know because we might actually do full you when you try and do a good job and that one brief moment. even if teacher wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it they don't have the test scores and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data for example New York pass the law that said that the teacher Improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachers. and so that's sort of working in the opposite direction but I'm optimistic about this I think there's some clear things we can do first of all there's a lot more testing going on and that's given us the picture of where we are and that allows us to understand who's doing it well and call them out and find out what those techniques are of course digital videos cheap now putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are are being recorded on an ongoing basis at is very practical in all public schools until every few weeks teachers could sit down and say okay here's a little clip of something I thought I did well. here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly advised me when this kid acted up how should I have dealt with that they can all sit and work together on those problems you can take the very best teachers I'm kind of annotated have it so everyone sees Who is the very best teaching the stuff you can take those Great Courses and make him available so that a kid could go out and watch the Physics course learn from that if you have a kid is behind you would know you could have signed in that video to watch and review the concept and impact these three courses could not only be available just on the internet but you can make it so that DVDs were always available and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers. and so by thinking of this as a Personnel system we can do it much better now there's a book actually about KIPP the place that this is going on the Jay Matthews a news reporter called work hard be nice and I thought it was so fantastic give you a sense of what a good teacher does I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book. that we put a lot of money and education and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a futuristic should have like we have in the stimulus Bill 1015 the house version actually had money in it for these Data Systems and will take it out in the Senate cuz they're people are threatened by these things but I am optimistic I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is and it really can make a difference for millions of lives if we get it right. why do we have time to frame those two problems there's a lot more problems like that aids pneumonia I'm just see her getting excited the very name of these things the skill sets were required to tackle these things are very broad you know the system doesn't naturally make it happen governments don't naturally take these things the right way out of the private sector doesn't naturally put its its resources into these things so it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things that other people involved and you're helping to come up with Solutions and with that I think there's some great things will come out of it thank you",0.7890625,
56,BillGross_2003.sph.wav,really good combination of those two factors it turns out there's a lot of powerful sun all around the world obviously but in special places where it happens to be relatively inexpensive to place these and also in many more places where there is high wind power so an example of that is here 's the map of the united states and all this does is affect the payback period it doesn't mean that you couldn't use solar energy you could use solar energy anywhere on earth it just affects the payback period if you're comparing to grid supplied electricity three lotus one two three came out and i was completely blown away by lotus one two three i began operating my business with one two three began writing add ins for one two three chances for solar energy and of course look at africa it's just unbelievable what the potential is to take advantage of solar energy there and i'm really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that so in conclusion i would say my journey has shown me that you can revisit old ideas in a new light and sometimes ideas that have been discarded in the past can be practical now if you apply some new technology or new twists if you get it down below five years then it becomes almost a no brainer because the interest to own it someone else will finance it for you and you can just make money basically from day one so that's our real powerful goal that we're really shooting for in the company other things that i learned that were very surprising to me one was how casual we are about energy at full power so there's basically fifteen horses running at full speed just to keep the stage lit not to mention the two hundred horses that are probably running right now to keep the airconditioning going just amazing walk in the elevator and there's lights on in the elevator of course now i'm very sensitive at home when we leave the lights on by mistake basically oil is solar energy concentrate it's been pounded for a billion years with a lot of energy to make it have all that energy contained in it and we don't have a birthright to just use that up as fast as we are i think then much much later in two thousand very recently the new california energy crisis or what was purported to be a big energy crisis was coming and i was trying to figure if there was some way we could build something that would capitalize on that and try and get people back up energy in case the crisis really came i started looking at how we could build battery back up systems that could give people five hours ten hours maybe even a full day or three days worth of back up power i'm glad you heard earlier today batteries are unbelievably energy lack of density compared to fuel so much more energy can be stored with fuel than with batteries you'd have to fill your entire parking space of one garage space just to give yourself four hours of battery back up and i concluded after researching every other technology that we could deploy for storing energy flywheels different formulations of batteries it just wasn't practical to store energy so what about making energy maybe we could make energy i tried to figure out maybe solar 's become attractive it's been twenty five years since i was doing this let me go back and look at what's been happening with solar cells and the price had gone down from ten dollars a watt to about four or five dollars a watt but it stabilized and it really needed to get much lower than that to be cost effective i studied all the new things that had happened in solar cells and was trying to look for ways we could innovate and make solar cells more inexpensively a lot of new things that are happening to do that but fundamentally the process requires a tremendous amount of energy some people even say it takes more energy to make a solar cell than it will give out in its entire life hopefully if we can reduce the amount of energy it takes to make the cells that will become more practical but right now you pretty much have to take so i thought of an idea what if we collect the sun with a large reflector like i had been thinking about way back when when i was in high school but maybe with modern technology we could make a cheaper large collector concentrate it to a small converter and then the conversion device wouldn't have to be as expensive because it's much smaller rather than solar cells which have to covering the entire surface area that you want to gather sun from very short on genetic algorithms it's a powerful way of solving intractable problems using natural selection you take a problem that you can't solve with a pure mathematical answer you build an evolutionary system to try multiple tries at guessing the energy crisis was in full bore i started reading popular science magazine and i got really excited about the potential of solar energy to try and solve that crisis you add sex where you take half of one solution and half of another and then make new mutations and you use natural selection to kill off not as good solutions usually with a genetic algorithm on a computer today with a three gigahertz processor you can solve many many formerly intractable problems in just a matter of minutes we tried to come up with a way to use genetic algorithms to create a new type of concentrator and i'll show you what we came up with traditionally concentrators look like this those shapes are they take all the parallel incoming rays and focus it to a single spot they have to track the sun because they have to be pointing directly at the sun they usually have about a one degree acceptance angle meaning once they're more than about a degree off with no moving parts so we created this genetic algorithm to try this out we made a model in xl of a multi surface reflector and an amazing thing evolved literally evolved from trying a billion cycles a billion different attempts with a fitness function that defined how can you collect the most light from the most angles over a day from the sun and this is the shape that evolved two places and take two bounces so for direct light it takes only one bounce for off axis light it might take two and for extreme off axis it might take three i had just taken trigonometry in high school i learned about the parabola and how it could concentrate rays of light to a single focus that got me very excited your efficiency goes down with more bounces because you lose about ten percent with each bounce but this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus twenty five degree angle so about two and a half hours of the day we could collect with a stationary component solar cells collect light for four and a half hours though on an average adjusted day a solar cell because the sun 's moving across the sky the solar cell is going down with a sine wave function of performance at the axis angles it collects about four an a half average hours of sunlight a day so even this although it was great with no moving parts we could achieve high temperatures enough we needed to beat solar cells so we took a look at another idea we looked at a way to break up a parabola into individual petals that would track so what you see here is twelve separate petals that each could be controlled with individual microprocessors that would only cost a dollar you can buy a two megahertz microprocessor for a dollar now and you can buy stepper motors that pretty much never wear out because they have no brushes for a dollar we can control all twelve of these petals for under fifty dollars and what this would allows us to do is not have to move the focus any more only move the petals the whole system would have a much lower profile but also we could gather sunlight for six and a half to seven hours a day now that we have concentrated sunlight what are we going to put at the center to and i really felt that there would be potential to build some kind of thing that could concentrate light so i started this company called solar devices and this was a company where i built so we tried to look at all the different heat engines that have been used in history to try and convert sunlight to electricity or heat to electricity and one of the great ones of all time he added a condenser to cool the steam outside the cylinder he made the engine double acting so it had double the power those were major breakthroughs i mean all of the improvements he made and it's justifiable that our measure of energy the watt today is named after him so we looked at this engine and this had some potential steam engines are dangerous and they had tremendous impact on the world as you know industrial revolution and ships and locomotives but they're usually good to be large so they're not good for this engine because it was so interesting it only worked on air no steam has led to hundreds of creative designs over the years that use the stirling engine principle and it was a major achievement because it brought the power density of the engine way up you could now get a lot more power in a lot smaller space and that allowed the engine to be used for mobile applications so once you have mobility so because it went into mass production costs were reduced one hundred years of refinement emissions were reduced looking at these three and forty seven others we concluded that the stirling engine would be the best one to use i want to give you a brief explanation of how we looked at it and how it works so we tried to look at the stirling engine in a new way because it was practical weight no longer mattered for our application the internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered because you were moving around but if you're trying to generate solar energy in a static place the weight doesn't matter so much the other thing we discovered is that efficiency doesn't matter so much if your energy source is free normally efficiency is crucial because the fuel cost of your engine over its life dwarfs the cost of the engine but if your fuel source is free then the only thing that matters is the up front capital cost of the engine so you don't want to optimize for efficiency you want to optimize for power per dollar so using that new twist with the new criteria we thought we could re look at the stirling engine and also bring genetic algorithms in basically robert stirling didn't have gordon moore before him to get us three gigahertz of processor power so we took the same genetic algorithm that we used earlier to make that concentrator which didn't work out for us to optimize the stirling engine and make its design sizes and all of its dimensions the exact optimum to get the most power per dollar irrespective of weight irrespective of size to get the most conversion of solar energy because the sun is free and that's the process we took let me show you how the engine works the simplest heat engine or hot air engine of all time would be this take a box a steel canister with a piston put a flame under it the piston moves up the problem is the efficiency is one hundredth of one percent because you're heating all the metal of the chamber and then cooling all the metal of the chamber each time you move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you're only shifting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end down to the hot end and up to the cold end so now you're i sold the plans for this engine and for this dish in the back of popular science magazine for four dollars each i'm still heating the air every time and cooling the air every time what about if i put a thermal sponge in the middle in the passageway between where the air has to move between hot and cold so he made fine wires and cracked glass and all different kinds of materials to be a heat sponge so when the air pushes up to go from the hot end to the cold end it puts some heat into the sponge and then when the air comes back after it's been cooled it picks up that heat again so you're reusing your energy five or six times and that brings the efficiency up between thirty and forty percent it's a little known but brilliant genius invention of robert stirling that takes the hot air engine from being somewhat impractical like i found out when i made the real simple version in high school to very potentially possible once you get the efficiency up if you can design this to be low enough cost so we really set out on a path to try and make the lowest cost possible we built a huge mathematical model of how a stirling engine works we applied the genetic and i earned enough money to pay for my first year of caltech it was a really big excitement for me to get into caltech and my first year at caltech i continued the business we got the results from that for the optimal engine we built engines so we built one hundred different engines over the last two years we measured each one we readjusted the model to what we measured and then we led that to the current prototype it led to a very compact inexpensive engine and this is what the engine looks like let me show you what it looks like in real life so this is the engine it's just a small cylinder down here which holds the generator inside and all the linkage and it's the hot cap the hot cylinder on the top this part gets hot this part is cool and electricity comes out the exact converse is also true if you put electricity in this will get hot and this will get cold you get refrigeration so it's a complete reversible cycle a very efficient cycle and quite a simple thing to make so now you put the two things together so you have the engine now what if you combine the petals and the engine in the center the petals track thank you so this is a unit with the twelve petals these petals cost about a dollar each lightweight injection bolted plastic aluminized the mechanism to control each petal is below there with a microprocessor on each one but then in the second year of caltech they started grading the whole first year was pass fail but the second year was graded i wasn't able to keep up with the business there are thermocouples on the engine little sensors that detect the heat when the sunlight strikes them each petal adjusts itself separately to keep the highest temperature on each one of these petals figures out where the sun is with no user set up so you don't have to tell what latitude longitude you're at you don't have to tell what your roof slope angle is doesn't really care what it does is it searches to find the hottest spot it searches again a half an hour later it searches again a day later it searches again a month later it basically figures out where on earth you are by watching the direction the sun moves so you don't have to actually enter anything about that the way the unit works is when the sun comes out the engine will start and you get power out here and i ended up with a twenty five year detour my dream had been to convert solar energy at a very practical cost but then i had this big detour first the hot water 's optional you don't have to use the hot water it will cool itself but you can use it to optionally heat hot water and that brings the efficiency up even higher so this is the first test where we took it outside and each of the petals were individually seeking and what they do is step it could be on your roof or in your backyard or somewhere else you don't have to have enough units to power your entire house you just save money with each incremental one you add so you're still using the grid potentially in this type of application to be your back up supply of course you can't use these at night and you can't use these on cloudy days but by reducing your energy use pretty much at the peak times usually when you have you air conditioning on or other times like that,1,"that's when I was 15 when I first got interested in solar energy I had my family had moved from Fort Lee New Jersey to California we moved from the snow too lots of heat and gas lines there was gas rationed in 1973 the energy crisis was in full bore I started reading Popular Science magazine when I got really excited about the potential of solar energy just try and solve at crisis I just taking trigonometry in high school I learned about the parabola and concentrate light rays of light to a single Focus that got me very excited and I really felt that it would be potential to build some kind of thing that can concentrate light so I started this company called so we're devices and it was a company that I built for a blister I took metal shop and remember walking to Middletown building problems and Stirling engines and is doing the stirling engine over in the lathe and all the biker guys motorcycle guy came over said you're building a bond or do I said no it so stirling engine really is didn't believe thee. I sold the plans for this engine and for this dish in the back of Popular Science magazine for $4 each and I aren't enough money to pay for my first year at Caltech was really big excitement for me to get into Cal Tech at my first year tell sec I continue the business but then in the second year of Caltech they started grading pull first year was pass-fail but the second you were graded I wasn't able to keep up with the business and I ended up with a 25-year detour my dream has been to convert solar energy at a very practical cost but then I had this big detour first the coursework at Caltech then when I graduated from Cal Tech the IBM PC came out and I got a dick to the IBM PC and I truly wanted an 93 Lotus 1-2-3 came out and I was completely blown away by lotus 1-2-3 began operating my business with 123 began writing an ad in for 1 to 3 to go to natural language interface to 123 start educational software company after I joined Lotus and then started ID lab so I can have a roof under which I could build multiple companies in succession. then much much later in 2003 recently the new California energy crisis or what was reported to be a big energy crisis was coming and I was trying to figure out if there was some way we could build something they would capitalize on that and find get people back up energy in case the price is really came when I started looking at how we could build battery backup systems that can get people 5 hours 10 hours maybe even a full day or 3 days worth of backup power glad you heard earlier today batteries are unbelievably energy lack of density not compared to fuel so much more energy can be stored with the old in with batteries you have to fill out your entire parking space of one garage days just to give yourself 4 hours of battery backup and I concluded after researching every other technology that we could deploy for storing energy flywheels different formulations of batteries it just wasn't practical to store energy. so what about making energy maybe we can make energy I tried to figure out Maybe soldiers become attractive it's been twenty-five years since I was doing this let me go back and look at what's been happening with solar cells and the price has gone down from $10 to about for $5 Whopper it stabilized and it really need to get much lower than that to be cost-effective I studied all the new things that happen in solar sales and was trying to look for some way we can innovate and makes or sells more inexpensively there a lot of new things that are happening to do that but fundamentally the process requires a tremendous amount of energy some people even say that takes more energy to make a solar cell and we'll get out in his tire life hopefully we can reduce the amount of energy it takes to make the cells become more practical but right now you pretty much have to take silicon put it in the oven at 1600 use Fahrenheit for 17 hours to make the sales lot of people are working on things to try and reduce that much but I didn't have anything to contribute in that area so I tried to figure out what other way can we try and make cost-effective so electricity but maybe with modern. how to make a cheaper lard collector concentrated to a small converter and then the conversion device wouldn't have to be as expensive because it's much smaller rather than solar cells with have to be covering the entire surface area that you want to get her son from the same practical now because a lot of new technologies how come in the 25 years since I last looked at it first was a lot of new manufacturing techniques not to mention really cheap miniature Motors brushless motors service motor stepper Motors are used in printers and scanners and things like that so that's a breakthrough of course inexpensive microprocessors and they're very important breakthrough genetic algorithms I'll be very sure it's a powerful way of all the intractable Problems by using natural selection you take a problem you can't solve with a mathematical answer you build an evolutionary system to try multiple tries to guessing you had sex before you take half of one solution have another and then make new mutations and you use natural selection to kill off not as good at Solutions usually with a genetic algorithm in computer today with a 3 GHz processor. you can solve many many formal intractable problems in just a matter of minutes so we tried to come up with a way to use genetic algorithms to create a new type of concentrator and I'll show you what we came up with those shapes are parabolas they take all the parallel incoming razor focus it to a single spot they have to track the sun because I have to be pointing directly at the Sun that usually have about a 1 degree acceptance angle meeting was there more than a degree off none of the sun light rays to hit the focus we try to come up with a way of making a non tracking collector collect it would gather much more than one degree of light with no moving parts so we created them to try this out we made a model in a Cell of a multi surface reflector and an amazing thing of all literally evolved from frying a billion cycles billion different attempts with a fitness function that they find how can you collect the most light from the most angles over a day from the Sun and this is the shaping of all it's just not tracking collector with these sticks to the like horns and each of them collect light in the following way if the sunlight is streit's right here but it might be. go to the center of the hot spot directly but if the Sun is off access and come from the side did my hit two places and take to bounce house so for direct B it takes only one bounce for all that says like it might take us to Cypress Tree Mall taxes it might take three your officials he goes down with more bounce house cuz you lose about 10% with each bounce but this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus 25 degree angle so about two-and-a-half hours a day we could collect with the stationary component solar cells collect light for four and a half hours though on an average adjusted a solar cell cuz the sun's moving across the sky at the store sell is going down with the sine wave function of performance at the office have access angles to collect about four-and-a-half average hours of sunlight a day even this although it was great with no moving parts we can achieve high temperatures wasn't enough we needed to beat solar cells to tackle another idea we've lived in a way to break up a parabola into individual pedals that would track so what you see here is twelve separate pedals that you could be controlled with individual microprocessors. only cost a dollar you can buy a 2 MHz microprocessor for a dollar now and you can buy stepper Motors that pretty much never wear out because they have no brushes for a dollar so we can control all twelve of these pedals for under $50 and what this will allow us to do is not have to move the focus anymore we only move the pedals the whole system would have a much lower profile but also we could gather sunlight for six and a half to 7 hours today. We have concentrated sunlight what are we going to put the sensor to a cattle to electricity. so we try to look at all the different heat engines that have been used in history to try and convert sunlight to electricity or heat to electricity and one of the great ones of all time James watt's steam engine of 1788 was a major major breakthrough invented steam engine you just re-signed it but his refinements were incredible he had a new linear motion guys to the Pistons he added a condenser to cool the scene outside the cylinder he made the engine double acting so I double up our bills were major breakthroughs the improvements he made and it's it's a justifiable that our measure of energy is to watch today is named after him to look at this engine and just had some potential damages are dangerous and they had tremendous impact on the world as you know it. Show Revolution and ships and locomotives but they're usually good to be large but are not good for distributed power generation they're also very high pressure so they're dangerous another type of engine is the hot air engine and the hot air engine also was not invented by Robert Sterling but Robert Sterling came along in 1816 and radically improved it because it was so interested. it's only worked on are no steam has led to hundreds of creative designs over the years that use the stirling engine principle but after the stirling engine Auto came along and also he didn't invent the internal combustion engine you just refined it you showed it in Paris 1867 and it was a major achievement because it brought the power density of the engine way up you can add that a lot more power in a lot smaller space and that allow the engine to be used for mobile applications. Once you have Mobility now you're making a lot of engines cuz you got lots of units at supposed to steam ships or big factories We're Not Making of a unit so this was the end of that ended up benefiting from mass production we're all the other engines get benefits so because it went into mass production costs are reduced hundred years of refinement emissions were reduced tremendous production volumes written hundreds of millions of internal combustion engine build a 2,000 Mercury Engines built and not nearly as many small steam engines being built anymore only large ones for big operations are looking at these 3 and 47 others we concluded that the stirling engine would be the best one to use. I want to give you a very brief explanation of how we will look at it and how it works so we tried to look at the stirling engine in a new way because it was practical wait no longer mattered for application the internal combustion engine took off his weight matter cuz you were moving around but if you're trying to generate solar energy in the static placed the way it doesn't matter so much do the thing we discovered was that efficiency doesn't matter so much if your energy source is free normally efficiency is crucial because the fuel cost of your engine overheats life dwarf the cost of the engine but if your fuel sources free then the only thing that matters is The Upfront Capital costs of the engine you don't want optimized for efficiency if you want to talk to my eyes for power per dollar so using that new twist with a new criteria we thought we could relook at the stirling engine and also bring genetic algorithms in basically Robert Sterling didn't have courted more before him to get us we get a processor power so we took the same genetic out within that we use earlier to make that concentrator which didn't work out for us to optimize the stirling engine and make it. design sizes and all of its Dimensions the exact Optimum to get the most power per dollar irrespective of the wait a respectable size just to get the most conversion of solar energy cuz it's on his free. and that's the process return let me show you how the engine works the simplest heat engine or hot air engine of all time would just be this take a box of Steel canister with a piston put a flame under it the Piston move up take off the flame and pour water on it or let it cool down the Piston move down that's a heat engine that's based on the most fundamental he didn't you could possibly have the problem is the efficiency is one-hundredth of 1% because you're getting all the metal of the chamber and then cooling all the middle of the chamber each time and only getting power from the air that's eating at the same time but you're wasting all the energy heating the middle in the middle so someone came up with a very clever idea to instead of heating wholesale the recording the whole cylinder what about if you put a display sir inside a little thing that shuttles hair back and forth you move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you're only shift in the air down to the hot end and up to the cold in down to the Hot N Cold in so now you're not alter Lee Heating and Cooling the metal you just alter the heating and cooling the air that allows you to get the efficiency up from 100% to about 2% and then Robert Sterling came out wrong with this genius. which was well I'm still not getting the mail now with this kind of engine but I'm still reheating all the air I'm still hitting the air every time and cool in the air every time what about if I put a thermal sponge in the middle in the passageway between where they are has to move between hot and cold so he made fine wires and cracked glass and all different types of materials to be a heat sponge so when the air pushes up to go from the hot and the cold and it put some heat into the sponge and then when the air comes back after it's been cool it picks up that heat again for your we using your energy 5 or 6 times and that brings efficiency up to between 30 40% it's a little-known but brilliant genius invention of Robert Sterling's to take the hot air engine from being somewhat practical like I found out when I did the real simple version high school to very potentially possible. what you get the efficiency up if you can design this to be alone up cost we really set out on a path to try and make the lowest-cost possible we got the results from that the optimal engine rebuilt engines who built a hundred different answers over the last two years we measured each one we read adjusted the model to what we measured and then we fled that to the car prototype it meant to a very compact inexpensive engine and this is what the engine looks like I'm sure what it looks like in real life. so this is the engine it's just a small cylinder down here which holds the generator inside and all the linkage and it's the hot Capp hot cylinder on the top this part gets hot this part is cool and electricity comes out I think that Converse is also true if you put electricity in this will get hot in this will get cold you get Refrigeration so it's a completely reversible cycle a very efficient cycle and quite a simple thing to make now you put the two things together so you have the engine now what if you combine the pedals and the engine the sensor the pedals track and the engine get the concentrate sunlight take that heat and turned into electricity this is what the first prototype of our system look like together with the Petals in the edge in the center this is being run out the Sun and now I want to show you what the actual thing looks like. thank you so so this is a unit with a twelve petals these pedals cost about a dollar each their lightweight injection molded plastic aluminized the mechanism to control each petal is below there with the microprocessor and each one their thermocouples on the engine little sensors that detect the heat when the sunlight strikes them so each petal adjust itself separately to keep the highest temperature on that when the sun comes out in the morning the pedals will seek the sun find it by searching for the highest temperature about a minute and a half or two minutes after the rays are striking a hawk have the engine we warm enough to start and then the engine will generate electricity for about six and a half hours a day six and a half to 7 hours of sun moves across the sky is each one of these panels are autonomous each one of these pedals figure out where the sun is with no user setup so you don't have to tell what latitude longitude you're at you don't have to tell what the roof slope angle is you want to tell her orientation it doesn't really care what it does is it searches to find the hottest spot. it searches again in half an hour later it starts again a day later so just getting left later because he figures out where on Earth You Are by watching the direction to sun moves so you don't have to actually enter anything about that the way that unit works is when the sun comes out the engine will start and you get power out here we have AC and DC get 12 volts DC so that could be used for certain applications we have an inverter in there so you get 117 v a c and you also get hot water the hot water is optional you don't have to use the hot water it will cool itself but you can use it to option we need hot water and that brings you fish in sea up even higher because some of the heat that you know we be rejecting you can I use as useful energy weathers for a pool or hot water let me show you a quick movie what this looks like running. this is the first test for we took it outside in each of the petals were individually seeking and what they do is Step very carefully at first and then very finely afterwards once they get a temperature reading on the thermocouple indicating they found the Sun and they slow down and do I find search and it all the pedals will move into position and then the engine will start sweeping working on this for the last two years were very excited about the progress we do have a very long way to go though still and let me tell you a little more about that this is how we envision it would be in a residential insulation you probably have more than one unit on your roof I could be in your room for your backyard or somewhere else you don't have to have enough units to power your entire house you just save money with a big metal when you add so you're still using the great potential in this type of application to be your backup Supply course you can't use these at night and you can't use that uses on cloudy days but by reducing your energy use pretty much at the peak times usually when you have your air conditioning on or other times like that. this generates the peak hour at the pq's of time so it's very complimentary in that sense this is how we would have been in the residential application we also think there's great potential for energy Farms especially in remote land what happens to be a lot of fun to really good combination of those two factors it turns out there's a lot of powerful son all around the world obviously but in special places where it happens to be relatively expensive to place these and also and many more places when there is where there is high wind power so example of that is here's the map of the United States pretty much everywhere that's not green or blue is really ideal place but even the green or blue areas are good just not as good as the places that are red orange and yellow but the hotspot ride around Las Vegas and Death Valley in that area is very very good and all this does is affect the payback. Doesn't mean that you could use solar energy could use solar energy anywhere on Earth it does affect the pay back. If you're comparing to grid Supply lectra City but if you don't have Ritz applied electricity in the whole question of payback is a different one entirely it's just how many watts do you get $4 and how could you benefit from that using that power. to change your life in some way this is a map of the United States this is the map of the whole earth and he can't even see a huge swath of the middle of pretty much where large part of the population is their tremendous chances for solar energy and of course look at Africa it's just unbelievable what the potential is to take advantage of solar energy there and I'm really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that so in conclusion I would say my journey has been that you can read is showing me that you can read is it old ideas in a new light and sometimes ideas have been discarded in the past can't be practical now if you play some new technology or new twist we believe we're getting very close to something got to go for double our short-term goal for this is to be half the price of solar cells and a longer-term goal is to be less than a five-year pay back and in less than five your pay back all the stuff is becomes very economics you don't have to just want to feel good attitude about energy to want to have one of these it just makes economic sense right now so we're paybacks are between Thirty and fifty years if we get down below five years and it just becomes almost a no-brainer because the interest to own it someone else. answer for you and you can just make money basically from day one so if that's a real powerful goal that we're really shooting for the company. 20 things I learned they were very surprising to me that one was how casual we are about energy I was walking from the elevator over here and you can just looking at the stage right now so there's probably 2500 watt lights right now there's ten thousand watts of light brown the stage 1 horsepower 746 w at full power so this is basically 15 horses running at full speed just to keep the stage with not to mention the 200 horses that are probably running right now to keep the air conditioning going and it's just amazing it walk in the elevator and his lights on in the elevator course now I'm very sensitive at home and we leave the lights on by mistake but everywhere around us we have insatiable used for energy because it's so cheap and it's cheap because we've been subsidized by energy to be concentrated by the sun basically oil is solar energy concentration it's been pounded for a billion years with a lot of energy to make it have all that energy contained in it and we don't have a Birthright to just use that up. fast as we are I think and it would be great if we could find a way to make our energy using renewable whereas we're using the energy trading at the same pace and I really hope we can get there thank you very much for the great audience",0.7395833730697632,
57,BillJoy_2006.sph.wav,so that people who are doing things that had a higher cost of catastrophe would have to take insurance against that risk so if you wanted to put a drug on the market you could put it on but it wouldn't have to be approved by regulators you'd have to convince an actuary with the law and finally i think we have to do something that's not really it's almost unacceptable to say this which we have to begin to design the future we can't pick the future but we can steer the future our investment in trying to prevent pandemic flu is affecting the distribution of possible outcomes we may not be able to stop it but the likelihood that it will get past us is lower if we focus on that problem so we can design the future if we choose what kind of things we want to have happen and not have happen and steer us to a lower risk place vice president gore will talk about how we could steer the climate trajectory into a lower probability of catastrophic risk but above all what we have to do is we have to help the good guys the people on the defensive side have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things and what we have to do to do that is we have to limit access to certain information and growing up as we have and holding very high the value of free speech this is a hard thing for us to accept for all of us to accept it's especially hard for the scientists to accept who still remember you know galileo essentially locked up and who are still fighting this battle against the church but that's the price of having a civilization the price of retaining the rule of law is to limit the access to the great and kind of unbridled power thank you it extends beyond a nation state it's not the nation states that have potential access to mass destruction but individuals and this is a consequence of the fact that these new technologies tend to be digital we saw genome sequences you can download the gene sequences of pathogens off the internet flu is too dangerous to fedex around if people want to use it in their labs for working on research just reconstruct it yourself what technology can we really apply because you know it might break in fedex so that this is possible to do this is not it be biological or other are clearly a danger in our world and the danger is that they can cause roughly what's a pandemic and we really don't have experience with pandemics and we're also not very good as a society at acting to things we don't have direct and sort of gut level experience with so it's not in our nature to pre act to reducing global poverty and in this case piling on more technology doesn't solve the problem because it only super empowers people more so the solution has to be as people like russell and einstein and others imagine in a conversation that existed in a much stronger form i think early in the twentieth century solution had to be not just the head but the heart you know public policy and moral progress the bargain that gives us civilization is a bargain to not use power and what i found was quite surprising we started looking at things like death rates in the twentieth century and how they'd been improved and very simple things turned out we get our individual rights by society protecting us from others not doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is legal and so to limit the danger of these new things we have to limit ultimately the ability of individuals to have access essentially to pandemic power we also have to have sensible defense because no limitation is going to prevent a crazy person from doing something the troubling thing is that it's much easier to do something bad than to defend against all possible bad things so the offensive uses and then i signed a book contract to write more gloomy thoughts about this and moved into a hotel room in new york with one room full of books on the plague and you know nuclear bombs exploding in new york where i would be within the circle and so on and then i was there on september and i stood in the streets with everyone and it was quite an experience to be there i got up the next morning and walked out of the city and all was quite a compelling experience but not really i suppose a surprise to someone who 'd had his room full of the books it was always a surprise that it happened then and there but it wasn't a surprise that it happened at all and everyone then started writing about this thousands of people started writing about this and i eventually abandoned the book and then chris called me to talk at the conference i really don't talk about this any more because you know there's enough frustrating and depressing things going on but i agreed to come and say a few things about this and i would say that we can't give up the rule of law to fight an asymmetric threat which is what we seem to be doing because of the present the people that are in power because that's to give up the thing that makes civilization and we fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we're doing because a million dollar act causes a billion dollars of damage causes a trillion dollar response which is largely ineffective and arguably so after giving up on the book and i had the great honor to be able to join kleiner perkins about a year ago and to work through venture capital on the innovative side and to try to find some innovations that could address what i saw as some of these big problems things where you know a factor of ten difference can make a factor of a thousand difference in the outcome the last year at the incredible quality and excitement of the innovations that have come across my desk it's overwhelming at times i'm very thankful for google and wikipedia so i can understand at least a little of what people are talking about who come through the doors but i wanted to share with you three areas that i'm particularly excited about and that relate to the problems that i was talking about in the wired article then early web the first is this whole area of education and it really relates to what nicholas was talking about with a hundred dollar computer and that is to say that would clearly make a huge difference to we've seen and i've had the pleasure to invest in companies that give me great confidence that we'll extend moore 's law all the way down to roughly the ten scale another factor of say six in dimensional reduction which should give us about another factor of one hundred in raw improvement in what the chips can do and so to put that in practical terms if something costs about one thousand dollars today that problem say the best personal computer you can buy that might be its cost i think we can have that in two thousand and twenty for ten dollars now just imagine what that hundred dollar computer will be in two thousand and twenty as a tool for education i think the challenge for us is i'm very certain that that will happen the challenge is will we develop but i also in looking at more powerful technologies and nanotechnology and genetic engineering the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device i'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers but we don't have very good software for them when they took the apple mac interface and they put it back on the apple ii the apple ii was perfectly capable of running that kind of interface we just didn't know how to do it at the time so given that we know and should believe because moore 's law a constant i mean it's just been very predictable progress over the last forty years or whatever we can know what the computers are going to be like in two thousand and twenty it's great that we have initiatives to say let 's go create the education and educate people in the world because that's a great force for peace and we can give everyone in the world a hundred dollar computer or a ten dollar computer in the next other new emerging kind of digital technologies became very concerned about the potential for abuse the thing that we see as the kind of moore 's law trend that's driving improvement in our ability to address the environmental problem is new materials we have a challenge because the urban population is growing in this century from two billion to six billion in a very short amount of time people are moving to the cities they all need clean water they need energy they need transportation and we want them to develop in a their strength they're almost the strongest material tensile strength material known if you make a three dimensional structure like a buckyball they have all sorts of incredible properties if you shoot a particle at them and knock a hole in them they repair themselves they go zip and they repair the hole in femtoseconds which is not is really quick if you think about it in history a long long time ago we dealt with the problem of if you shine a light on them they produce electricity in fact if you flash them with a camera they catch on fire if you put electricity on them they emit light if you run current through them you can run one thousand times more current through one of these than through a piece of metal you can make both p and n type semiconductors which means you can make transistors out of them they conduct heat along their length but not across well there is no width but not in the other direction if you stack them up that's a property of carbon fiber also if you put particles in them and they go shooting out the tip they're like miniature linear accelerators or electron guns the inside where the kind of things lisa randall 's talking about are in there i had one business plan where i was trying to learn more about witten 's cosmic dimension strings to try to understand what the phenomenon was going on in this proposed nanomaterial so that we can do things with different properties lighter stronger and apply these new materials to the environmental problems new materials that can make water new materials that can make fuel cells work better new materials that catalyze chemical reactions that cut pollution and so on ethanol new ways of making ethanol new ways of making electric transportation the whole green dream because it can be profitable we've dedicated we've just raised a new fund we dedicated one hundred million dollars to these kinds of investments we believe that genentech the compaq the lotus the sun the netscape the amazon the google in these fields are yet to be found because this materials revolution will drive these things forward the third area that we're working on and we just announced last week we were all in new york we raised two hundred million dollars in a specialty fund to work on a pandemic in biodefense and to give you an idea of the last fund that kleiner raised was a four hundred million dollar fund so this for us is a very substantial fund john doerr and brook and others got concerned and we started looking around at what the world was doing about being prepared for a pandemic and we saw to keep the many from tyrannizing the one we came up with concepts like individual liberty a lot of gaps and so we asked ourselves you know can we find innovative things that will go fill these gaps and a break here he said he 's found so much stuff he can't sleep because there's so many great technologies out there we're essentially buried and we need them you know we have one antiviral that people are talking about stockpiling that still works roughly that's tamiflu but tamiflu the virus is resistant it is resistant to tamiflu we've discovered with aids we need cocktails to work well so that the viral resistance we need several antivirals we need better surveillance we need networks that can find out what's going on we need rapid diagnostics so that we can tell if somebody has a strain of flu which we have only identified very recently we've got to be able to make the rapid diagnostics quickly we need new antivirals and cocktails we need new kinds of vaccines vaccines that are broad spectrum vaccines that we can manufacture quickly we believe that if we could fill these ten gaps we have a chance to help really reduce the risk of a pandemic and the difference between a normal flu season and a pandemic is about a factor of one thousand in deaths and certainly enormous economic impact that will address this so if we can address use technology help address education help address the environment help address the pandemic does that solve the larger problem so what we need to do is we need better policy and for example some things we could do that would be policy solutions which are not really in the political air right now but perhaps with the change of administration would be use markets markets are a very strong force for example rather than try to regulate away problems which probably won 't work if we could price into the cost of doing business the cost of catastrophe,1,"what technology can we really apply to reducing Global poverty and what I found was quite surprising that you started looking at things like death rates in the twentieth century how they didn't improve in very simple things turned out you think maybe antibiotics made more difference than clean water but it's actually the opposite and so very simple things off-the-shelf technologies that we could find these lianda then early web would clearly make a huge difference to to that problem but I also and looking at more powerful Technologies and nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital Technologies became very concerned. about the potential for abuse if you think about it in history a long long time ago we dealt with the problem of an individual abusing another individual we came with something to Ten Commandments. Shall not kill that's a kind of a one-on-one thing we are going to extend the cities we had many people and to keep the menu from tyrannizing the one we came up with Concepts like individual liberty. home and then have to deal with large groups at the nation-state level and we had to have mutual non-aggression or through a series of conflicts we eventually came to a rough International bargain to largely keep the peace but now we have a new situation. are really in a cement with people calling asymmetric situation where technology is so powerful that it extends beyond the nation-state it's not the nation states that have potential access to mass destruction but the butt individuals and as a consequence of the fact these new technologies tend to be digital we saw genome sequences you can download the gene sequences of pathogens off the internet if you want to and clearly someone recently I saw a Science magazine I said well the 1918 flu is too dangerous to FedEx around if people want to use it in their labs for working on Research just reconstruct it yourself. so because we mean I'm not getting my break and then FedEx so that this is possible to do this is not deniable so individuals and small groups super empowered by access to these kind of self-replicating Technologies whether it be biological or other are clearly a danger in our world and the dangerous that they can cause roughly what's a pandemic and we really don't have experience with pandemics and we're also not very good as a society at acting two things we don't have direct into a gut-level experience with that's not our nature is not in our nature to pre-act. and in this case more than worth calling on more technology doesn't solve the problem cuz it only super empowers people more so the solution has to be as people like Russell and Einstein and others to imagine the conversation that existed in a much stronger form I think early in the twentieth century that the solution had to be not just a head but the heart on your towels public policy moral progress. how the civilizing the bargain that gives a civilization is a bargain to not use power we get our individual rights by Society protecting us from others using not doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is his legal and so to limit the danger of these new things we have to limit ultimately ability of individuals to have access to sensitive pandemic power we also have to have sensible defense because no no a limitation is going to prevent a crazy person from doing something but the bad them to defend against all possible bad thing so the offensive uses I really have an asymmetric Advantage so these are the kind of thoughts I was thinking in 1999 and 2000 and my friends told me I was getting really depressed and they were really worried about me and then I signed a book contract to write more gloomy thoughts about this and moved into a hotel room in New York with a with one room full of books on the plague and you know the nuclear bomb. exploding in New York where I would be within the circle and so on and then I was there on September 11th. am I still in the streets with everyone and it was quite it was quite an experience to be there I got up the next morning and walked out of the city and they were all the sanitation trucks are parked on Houston Street ready to go down and start taking the rubble away and I walk down the middle up to the train station and you do everything below fourteenth street was closed it was quite a compelling experience but not really a I suppose as surprised as someone who'd had this control of the books I do it's always so surprised that that happened and then into there but it wasn't surprised that it happened at all when I M Chris called me to talk to conference I really don't talk about this anymore because he knows there's enough frustrating and depressing things going on but I agreed to come and stay a few things about this and I would say that. you know we can't give up the rule of law to fight an asymmetric threat just what we seem to be doing because of the present the people that are in power because that's to give up the thing that makes civilization and we can't fight the threat in the kind of stupid we were doing because a million-dollar act causes a billion dollars of damage causes a trillion-dollar response which is largely ineffective and arguably probably almost certainly has made the problem worse so we can't we can't fight the thing with a million to one cost 1 and 1/2 a million cost-benefit ratio. so. so after giving up on the book and I had the great honor to be able to join Kleiner Perkins about a year ago and to work that through Venture Capital fund the innovator side and to try to find some innovations that could address what I saw is some of these big problems things where you know a factor of ten difference can make a factor of a thousand difference in the outcome I've been amazed in the last year at the incredible quality of an excitement of the innovations that have come across my desk. It's overwhelming at times I'm very thankful for Google and Wikipedia so I can understand that the least a little of what people are talking about who come through the doors. I wanted to share with you three areas that I'm particularly excited about and that relate to the problems that I was talking about in the. the word article. the first is this whole area of education and it really relates to a necklace was talking about was $100 computer and that is to say that there's a lot of legs left in Moore's law on the most advanced transitions today read 65 nanometers and we've seen and I had the pleasure to invest in companies that give me great confidence that will extend Moore's law all the way down to run for the 10 Nana 10 nanometer scale another factor of say six in dimensional reduction which should give us about another factor of 100 and Improvement and what the chips can do. and so to put that in Practical terms if something cost about $1,000 today say the best personal computer you can buy them a cost I think we can have that in 2020 for $10. okay now just imagine what that hundred-dollar computer will be in 2020 as a tool for education I think the challenge for us is I'm very certain that that will happen the challenges will we develop the kind of Educational Tools and things with a net to make it to let us take advantage of that device I'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computer so we don't have very good software for them and it's only in retrospect after the better offer comes along you take it and run on a 10 year old missing say God the machine was that fast or when they took the Apple Mac interface and I put it back on the Apple to the Apple 2 was perfectly capable of running that kind of interface we just didn't know how to do it at the time so given that we we no one should believe because Moore's laws been like the constant I'm it's just been it's been very predictable progress over the last 40 years or whatever we can we can know what the computers are going to be like in 2020 it's gray. we have initiative to sagos Coke recreate the education and educate people in the world cuz that's a great force for peace and we can give everyone in the world and a hundred-dollar computer a $10 computer in the next 15 years the second area that I'm focusing on is the Environmental problem because that's clearly going to put a lot of pressure on this world will have a lot more about that from Al Gore very shortly I want the thing that we see is the kind of Moore's Law Trend that's driving improvement in our ability to address environmental problem is is new materials are we have a challenge because the urban population is growing in the century from 2 billion to 6 billion in a very short amount of time people are moving to the cities they all need clean water The energy they need Transportation if we want them to develop in a Greenway. we're reasonably efficient in the industrial sectors we've made improvements in energy and resource efficiency but the consumer sector especially in America is very very inefficient but these new materials bring such an incredible innovations that there's a strong basis for hope that these things will be so profitable if they can be brought to the market and I want to give you a specific example of a new material that was discovered 15 years ago to take carbon nanotubes Museum of discovery of a 1991 they just have incredible properties news of the kinds of things were going to discover as we start to engineer at the nanoscale their strengths are almost the strongest material of tensile strength of material known there's they're very very stiff they stretch very very little in two dimensions of you make a a like a fabric out of them there 30 times stronger than Kevlar and if you make a three-dimensional structure like a buckyball that they have all sorts of incredible properties they if you. shoot a particle at them and knock a hole in them they repair themselves they go zipping to repair the hole in femtoseconds which is not is really quick if you shine light on them. they produce electricity affect you flashing with a camera that catch on fire if you put electricity on them they admit light if you'd run current through them you can run a thousand times more current through one of these then through a piece of metal you can make both P&M type semiconductors which means you can make transistors out of them they conduct heat along their length but not across the weather in the woods but not in the other direction if you stack them up that's what property of carbon fiber also if you put particles in them that if they're like little miniature or linear accelerators are electron guns the inside of the nanotubes is so small the smallest ones are points 7 nanometers that it's basically a Quantum world it's a strange place inside a nanotube and so we begin to see and we seen business plans already for the kind of things Lisa randle's talking about her in there I had one business plan where I was trying to learn more about witten's Cosmic Dimensions strings to try to understand what the phenomenon was going on. proposed nanomaterial so in the inside of a Nana to were really at the at the limit here so what we see is with these and other new materials. that we can we can do things with different properties lighters stronger and apply these new materials to the environmental problems new materials that can make water new materials that can make fuel cells work better new materials that catalyze chemical reactions that that cut pollution and so on a fan all new ways of making ethanol new ways of making electric transportation the whole green the whole green dream because it can be profitable and we've dedicated we just raced a new phone we dedicated a hundred million dollars to these kinds of Investments we we we believe the Genentech the compact a Lotus the Sun the Nets gave the Amazon to Google in this in this field are yet to be found because this materials Revolution will drive these things forward. the third area that we're working on and we just announced last week we were all in New York we raised two hundred million dollars especially fund to work on a pandemic and bio-defense and to give you an idea of the last phone decline a race with a 400 million dollar fun so this is Bruster's a very substantial and we did it over the last two months 2 months ago a cruise one I wrote an op-ed in the New York Times about how publishing a 1918 Gina was very dangerous and John Doran broken others got got concerned for bars and we started looking around at what the world was doing about being prepared for a pandemic and we saw a lot of gaps and so we asked ourselves you know can we find Innovative things that will go fill these gaps and Brooke told me to break here he says he's found so much stuff he can't sleep just there's so many great technology. out there we're since we buried and we need them you know we have one antiviral that people are talking about stack of stockpiling that still works roughly that's Tamiflu. the Tamiflu the virus is resistant resistant to Tamiflu with food cocktails to to work well so that the resistance we need several girls we need better surveillance we need networks that can find out what's going on we need rapid diagnostic so we can tell if somebody has a strain of a strain of fluids me love only identified very recently we got to be able to make the rapid Diagnostics quickly we can do antivirals and Cocktails we need new kinds of vaccines vaccines that are broad-spectrum vaccines that we can manufacture quickly cocktails more pollyville and vaccines normally get at rival and vaccine against 3000 poster as we need we need we don't know where this thing is going we believe that if we could fill these 10 gaps we have a chance to help really reduced the risk of a pandemic and the difference between a normal flu season and a pandemic is about a factor of 1000 in in in in Des and. currently enormous economic impact so we're very excited cuz we think we can fund 10 or speed up 10 projects and see what kind of Mark in the next couple years all that will address this so we can address you sick Knology help address education help address the environment Health address of pandemic does that solve the larger problem that I was talking about in the word out of freed the answer is really know because you can't solve a problem with the management technology with more technology if we let an unlimited amount of power loose then we will a very small number of people will be able to use that we can't fight it again it a million to one disadvantage so what we need to do is we need better policy and for example some things we could do that would be policy Solutions which are not really in the political are right now but crafts with a change of administration would be use Market. markets are a very strong force for example rather than trying to regulate away problems which probably won't work if we could price into the cost of doing business the cost of catastrophe. so that people who are doing things that had a higher cost of a test you would have to take insurance against that risk so if you want to put a drug on the market you could put it on but it wouldn't have to be approved by Regulators you'd have to convince an actuary said it would be safe and if you apply the notion of insurance more more broadly you can you can use a more powerful force a market for us to provide feedback how could you keep the law I think the law would be a really good thing to keep what you have to hold people accountable the law requires accountability today scientist acknowledgement technologist businessman Engineers don't take any don't have any personal responsibility for the consequences of their actions so you could try that you have to tie that back with the law and then finally I think we have to do something that's not really it's almost unacceptable to say is which we have to begin to design the future. we can't pick the future but we can steer the future our investment in trying to prevent pandemic flu is affecting the distribution of possible outcomes we may not be able to stop it but the likelihood that it'll get past this is lower if we focus on that problem so we can we can design the future if we choose what kind of things would want to have happen and not have happened and steer the stairs to a lower risk place like vice president Gore we'll talk about how we could steer the climate trajectory into a lower probability of catastrophic risk but above all we have to do is we have to help the good guys the people on the defensive side have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things and we have to do to do that as we have to limit access to certain information. and growing up is we have and holding very high the value of free speech this is a hard thing for us to accept for all of us to accept us especially hard for the scientists to accept who still remember no Galileo essentially locked up and we're still fighting this battle against the church but that's the price of having a civilization of the price of retaining the rule of law is to limit the access to the great and kind of unbridled power thank you",0.7708333134651184,
58,BillStone_2007.sph.wav,it can be done in seven years with the right backing those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history and join other bold individuals from time past who had they been here today would have heartily approved we have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance from the entrance this is nothing like a commercial cave there was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier we have collectively forgotten that lesson now we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward one hundred years after sir ernest shackleton wrote these words i intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon and complete the final piece that will open the space frontier in our time for all of us thank you you're looking at camp two in a place called j two not k two but j two we're roughly two days from the entrance at that point and first place i'd like to take you is what many believe will be damp moist cold conditions in utterly dark places i should mention that everything you're seeing here by the way is artificially illuminated at great effort otherwise it is completely dark in these places deeper you go the more you run into a conflict with water it's basically like a tree collecting water coming down and eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous and unfortunately slides just don't do justice so i've got a very brief clip here taken in the late nineteen eighties descend into huautla plateau in mexico the world 's deepest natural abyss and i say believe because this process is still ongoing right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year that i'll talk a little bit about i have to tell you that the techniques being shown here are obsolete and dangerous we would not do this today unless we were doing it for film along that same line to tell you that with the spate of hollywood movies came out last year we have never seen monsters underground at least the kind that eat you if there is a monster underground it is the crushing psychological remoteness that begins to hit every member of the team once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance next year i'll be leading an international team to j two we're going to be shooting from minus two thousand six hundred meters that's a little over eight thousand six hundred feet down at thirty kilometers from the entrance the lead crews will be underground for pushing thirty days straight i don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time when you used to find these things they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon now i remember that term really well for two reasons number one it's the name of my rock band and second is because the confrontation of these things forced me to become an inventor and we've since gone on to develop many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this this is some life support equipment closed cycle and you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally underwater and to depths of two hundred meters straight down underwater when you do this kind of stuff it's like doing eva it's like doing extra vehicular activity in space at much greater distances and at much greater physical peril so it makes you think about how to design your equipment for long range away from a safe haven here 's a things that's changed here in the last one hundred and fifty years since jules verne had great science fiction concepts of what the underworld was like is that this is where the it was developed within a two year period and used on actual exploratory projects this gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper and it produced the first three dimensional map anybody has ever done of a cave and it happened to be underwater in wakulla springs it was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door to another unexplored world this is europa carolyn porco mentioned another one called enceladus the other day this is one of the places where couple of years ago called aliens of the deep there was a brief clip a mission to explore under the ice of europa would be the ultimate to it's basically a nuclear heated torpedo when you reach the surface needs to be one smart puppy able to navigate and make decisions jim didn't know when he released that movie was that six months earlier nasa had funded a team i assembled three years of engineering meetings design and system integration and introduced depthx deep phreatic thermal explorer and as the movie says this is one smart puppy more than ten kilos of tnt in electrical onboard equivalent this is the target site the world 's deepest hydrothermal spring at cenote zacaton in northern mexico it's been explored to a depth of two hundred and ninety two meters and beyond that nobody knows anything this is part of depthx 's mission there's two primary targets we're doing here one is how do you do science autonomy underground how do you take a robot and turn it into a field wall where there's a high probability of life we move along the wall in what's called proximity operations looking for changes in color if we see something that looks interesting we pull it into a microscope if it passes the microscopic test and chambers so large that you can see for hundreds of meters without a break in the line of sight we go for a collection we either draw in a liquid sample or we can actually take a solid core from the wall no hands at the wheel this is all behavioral autonomy here that's being conducted by the robot on its own the real hat trick for this vehicle though is a disruptive new navigation system we've developed known as three d slam for simultaneous localization and mapping an all seeing eyeball its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time allowing it to do new exploration while it's still achieving geometric sensor lock on what it's gone through already what i'm going to show you next is the first fully autonomous when you go on a thing like this we can usually be in the field for anywhere from two to four months with a team of as small as twenty or thirty to as big as one hundred and fifty this may we're going to go from minus one thousand meters in zacaton and if we're very lucky depthx will bring back the first robotically discovered division of bacteria the successful conclusion of that mission will result in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number of government scientists and pilots it will leave us no further along in the general expansion of humanity into space than we were fifty years ago to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas and i hope you'll bear with me and have some faith that there's credibility behind what we're going to say here there are three underpinnings is the requirement for economical earth to space transport the bert rutans and richard bransons of this world have got this in their sights and i salute them go go go the next thing we need people ask me you know what kind of people do you get for a project like this and while our are places to stay on orbit orbital hotels to start with but workshops for the rest of us later on the final missing piece the real paradigm buster is this a gas station on orbit it's not going to look like that if it existed it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning now ten thousand dollars for that in orbit the second is more than ninety percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant thus every time you'd want to do anything in space you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money every time you hit the accelerator not even the guys at tesla can fight that physics so what a place where you can in fact you can get it better you can get it at fourteen times lower if you can find propellant on the moon was a strong hydrogen signature at shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon that signal was so strong it could only have been produced by ten trillion tons of water buried in the sediment collected over millions and billions of years by the impact of asteroids and comet material if we're going to get that and make that gas station possible we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space we can't do that right now the way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack that has to be launched from the ground and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces we have to beat that we can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics we can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything this is an idea that again to just about everything bob bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit we can go much further we can build space tugs orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water there's another thing when you're coming back from the moon you have to deal with orbital mechanics it says you're moving ten thousand feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station you got two choices you can burn rocket fuel to get there or you can do something really incredible but we also value esprit de corps and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter personal conflict while under great stress in remote locations the traditional approach to space exploration has been that you carry all the fuel you need to get everybody back in case of an emergency if you try to do that for the moon you're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there but if you send a mining team there without the return propellant first this is not like that i'm much more like scotty i like this equipment you know and i really value it so we're not going to burn the gear but if you were truly bold you could get it there manufacture it and it would be the most dramatic demonstration that you could do something worthwhile off this planet that has ever been done that's not true in seven years we could pull off an industrial mission to shackleton and demonstrate that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low earth orbit the orbital refueling stations i've just described could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key for opening space to the general exploration to bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed we can do it by jump starting with an industrial lewis and clark expedition to shackleton crater like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at ted i intend to lead that expedition,1,"first place I'd like to take you is what many believe will be the world's deepest natural this and I say believe because the process is still ongoing right now there are major Expedition is being planned for next to your little talk a little bit about why things have changed here in the last hundred and fifty years since Jules Verne had great science fiction concepts of what the underworld was like is that technology has enabled us to go to these places that were previously completely unknown and speculated about we can now the send thousands of metres into the Earth with relative impunity along the way we've discovered fantastic abysses and Chambers so large that you can see for hundreds of meters without a break in the line of sight when you go on a thing like this we can usually be in the field for anywhere from two to four months with a team of a small has 20 or 30 to as big as 150 and. why do people ask me what kind of people do you get for a project like this in a while. while our selection process is not as rigorous as NASA it's nonetheless thorough we're looking for confidence discipline endurance and strength feature wondering this is our strength test but we also value Esprit de corps and the ability to diplomatically resolve interpersonal conflict while under great stress and remote locations. we have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance from the entrance this is nothing like a a commercial cave you looking at Camp to and in a place called Jay to not K2 but J2 we're roughly two days from the entrance at that point and it's kind of like a high-altitude mountaineering trip in Reverse except that you're now running a string of these things down the ideas to try to provide some measure of physical Comfort while you're down there otherwise in damp moist cold conditions in out early Dark Places I should mention that everything you're seeing here by the way is artificially illuminated at great effort otherwise it is completely dark in these places the deeper you go the more you run into a conflict with water but like basically like a tree collecting water coming down and eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous and unfortunately slides just don't do justice I've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the. 1980s the descendant of the W Le plateau in in Mexico. I have to tell you that the techniques is being shown here are Obsolete and dangerous we would not do this today unless we were doing it for film. along that same line I have to tell you that with the Spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year we have never seen Monsters underground at least kind of eat you if there is a monster underground it is the crushing psychological remoteness that begins to hit every member of the team once you cross about 3 days inbound from the nearest entrance. next year I'll be leading an international team to J2 we're going to be shooting 4 - 2600 M that's a little over eight thousand six hundred feet down at 30 km from the entrance the lead Crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight I don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time eventually if you keep going down in these things probability says that you're going to run into a place like this it's a place where there's a fold in their geologic stratum that collects water and fills to the roof and when used to find these things they would put in a label on a map that said terminal siphon now I remember that turned really well for two reasons. Number one it's the name of my rock band and second is because the confrontation of these things forced me to become an inventor and we've since gone on to develop many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this is some life-support equipment close cycle and you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally under water and two deaths of two hundred meters straight. underwater when you do this kind of stuff it's like doing Eva it's it's like doing extra hit you later activity in space but at much greater distances and it much greater physical Peril so it makes you think about how to design your equipment for long-range away from a safe haven from a National Geographic movie that came out in 1999 process of putting your foot in places where he has never stepped before. it's been for the last little nugget of totally unknown to experience it is a privilege. that was taken in Wakulla Springs Florida couple things to note about that movie every piece of equipment that you saw in there did not exist before 1999 it was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects this gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper and It produced the first three-dimensional map anybody has ever done of a cave and it was happened to be under water in Wakulla Springs it was that Gadget that serendipitously open the door to another unexplored world. this is Europa Carolyn Porco mentioned another one called and saw this the other day this is one of the places where planetary scientists believe there is a highest probability of detection of the first wife off Earth in the ocean that exist below there for those who have never seen this story Jim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie couple years ago called aliens of the deep there was a brief clip with Custom Sounds on a mission to explore under the ice of Europa would be the ultimate challenge. Europa is so far away but even at the speed of light it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle it has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards and to find a good Landing site on the ice. now I got to get through the ice. you need some milk. It's basically a nuclear hida torpedo. you guys could be anywhere from 3 to 6 p.m. I beat week after week the milk produce think of its own way through the ancient eyes until finally. now what you going to do when you reach the surface of that early. you need an Aug an autonomous underwater vehicle needs to be one smart puppy able to navigate and make decisions on its own and inhaling an ocean. what Jim didn't know when he released that movie was the six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled to develop a prototype for the Europa auv. I'm going to cut through. 3 years of engineering meetings design and system integration and introduce depthx deep phreatic thermal Explorer and as the movie says this is one smart puppy. it's got 96 sensors 36 onboard computers a hundred thousand lines of Behavioral autonomy code. Pax more than 10 kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent this is the target site the world's deepest hydrothermal spring at cenotes Aqua tone in Northern Mexico has been explored to a depth of 292 M & Beyond. Nobody knows anything. this is part of depth xmission there's two primary targets were doing here one is how do you do science autonomy underground how do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist there's more stages involved her then I've got time to tell you about the basically we drive through the space we populate it with environmental variables sulfide halide things like that we calculate gradient services and drive the bot over to a wall where there is a high probability of life we move along the wall in what's called proximity operations looking for changes in color if we see something that looks interesting we pulled into a microscope if it passes the microscopic test we go for a collection we the drawing a liquid sample or we can actually take a solid core from the wall no hands at the wheel this is all behavioral autonomy here that's being conducted by the robot on its own. the real hat trick for this vehicle though is a disruptive new navigation system we've developed known as 3D slam for simultaneous localization and mapping. depthx is an All-Seeing Eye ball its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time allowing it to do new exploration while it's still at even geometric sensor lock on what it's going through already I'm going to show you next is the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground that's ever been done.this may not we're going to go 4 - 1000 in socket own and if we are very lucky that sex will bring back the first robotically discovered division of bacteria the next step after that is the tested in Antarctica and then if the funding continues that NASA has the resolution to go we could potentially launch by 2016 and by 2019 we may have the first evidence of Life off this planet. what then of man space exploration. the government recently announced plans to return to the Moon by 2024 the successful conclusion of that mission will result in the infrequent visitation of the Moon by a small number of government scientists and Pilots it will leave us no further along in the general expansion of humanity into space than we were fifty years ago something fundamental has to change if we are to see, and access to space In Our Lifetime show you next to a couple of controversial ideas and I hope you'll bear with me and and have some faith that there's credibility behind but we're going to stay here there are three underpinnings of working in space. privately one of them is the requirement for economical Earth to space transport and Richard Branson's of this world have got this in their sights and I salute them go go go the next thing we need are places to stay on orbit orbital hotels to start with that workshops for the rest of us later on the final missing piece the real Paradigm Buster is this. a gas station on orbit it's not going to look like that if it existed it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning now to give you a chance to understand why there is power in that statement I've got to give you the basics of space 101 and the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kg. anybody drink one of these here this week. you paid $10,000 for that in orbit. that's more than you pay for it here for a Ted If Google drop their sponsorship. the second is more than 90% of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant. Every time you do want to do anything in space you are literally blowing away in your sums of money every time you hit the accelerator not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics. so what if. you can get your gas at a tenth the price. there's a place where you can in fact you can get it better if you can get it at 14 X lower if you can find propellant on the moon there was a little-known mission that was launched by the Pentagon 13 years ago now called Clementine and the most amazing thing that came out of that mission was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater on the South Pole the Moon that signal was so strong it could only have been produced by ten trillion tons of water buried in the sediment collected over millions and billions of years by the impact of asteroids and comets material. if we're going to get that and make that gas station possible we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space we can't do that right now the way you normally build a system right now if you have a tubestock that has to be launched from the ground and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces we have to beat that we can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics we can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything this is an idea that again I came out to Livermore back in 1989 with Dr laurelwoods group and we can extend that now to just about everything. Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit we can go much further we can build space tugs orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water. there's another thing when you're coming back from the Moon you have to deal with orbital mechanics it says you're moving 10,000 feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station you got two choices you can bring Rocket Fuel to get there or you can do something really incredible you can dive into the stratosphere and precisely dissipate that velocity and come back out to the space station it has never been done it's risky and it's going to be one hell of a ride better than Disney. the traditional approach to space exploration has been that you carry all the fuel you need to get everybody back in case of an emergency you try to do that for the moon you're going to burn a billion dollars and fuel loan sending a crew out there but if you send the mining team there without the return propellant first. can any of you guys hear the story of Cortez. this is this is not like that I'm much more like Scotty I like this equipment you know and I really value it's where I got to burn the gear but if you were truly bold you could get it there manufacturer it and it would be the most dramatic demonstration that you could do something worthwhile off this planet that has ever been done there's a myth that you can't do anything in space for less than a trillion dollars. I'm 20 years that's not true in 7 years we could pull off an industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate that you could provide commercial reality out of this and Laura torben. we're living in one of the most exciting times in history we were at a magical Confluence were private wealth in imagination or driving the demand for access to space you are the refueling stations have just described to create an entirely new industry and provide the final key for Opening space to the general exploration the bus the Paradigm a radically different approach is needed we can do it by jump-starting with an industrial Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater the mind the moon for resources and demonstrate they can form the basis for profitable business on orbit space always seems to be hung on ambiguities of purpose and timing is here by putting a stake in the sand at Ted. I intend to lead that expedition. it can be done in 7 years with the right backing those who join me and making it happen will become a part of history and join other bold individuals from timepass to had they been here today with a part of the approved. there was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier we have collectively forgotten that lesson. now we are at a time when boldness is required to move forward. 100 years after sir Ernest Shackleton wrote these words I intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon and complete the final piece that will open the space Frontier in our time for all of us thank you",0.7669271230697632,
59,BillStrickland_2002.sph.wav,i i can't get these parents to come to the school he said i 'll get them to to sign a piece of paper that says you can art opening but you probably didn't have one children at the manchester craftsmen 's guild because there is no statistical difference between the white parents so for the remaining two years of my high school have to i even stuck just got this slide i gave this little slide show at a place and i did all right and the woman came out of the audience she said that was a great story and i was very criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old and i said well what do you do for a living you that hp and a furniture company called steelcase have adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology and all you so it's kind of the world debut of our digital imaging center i only have a couple more slides and this is where the story gets kind so i just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes and and a guy named dizzy gillespie showed up to play there because he knew this man over here marty ashby and i stood on that stage with dizzy gillespie on sound on a wednesday afternoon and i said dizzy why would you come to a black run center in the middle of an industrial park with a high crime rate that doesn't even have a reputation in music he said because i heard you built the center and i didn't believe that you i wanted to see for myself and i have i want to give you a gift i said you 're the gift he said no sir and i recorded dizzy and he died a year later and and a band called the count basie orchestra guy named gary burton all have come to this center in the middle of an industrial park the greatest artists and i don't want it on my conscience but not before his last recording was school and i'm taking you with when the basie band came the band got so excited about the school they voted to give me the rights to the music he drove me out to the university of pittsburgh where i filled out a college application jazz orchestra dropped and we recorded them and got nominated for a second grammy back to back hot city with a high crime place all filled up with bomb on that room you'd have wiped out all the money in including my mother and father just like and he was was our first recording studio which was and i can now tell you with absolute certainty an appearance on oprah winfrey will sell ten thousand cds we are currently number four on the billboard charts right tony bennett and i think we're going to be this was burned out during the riots this is next to my building and so i had another cardboard box built and i walked back out on the streets again and that's the building and that's the model and on the right 's the high tech greenhouse and in the middle 's the medical technology building and i'm very pleased to tell you that the the guy who came from the neighborhood a great honor to be here also every building the university of pittsburgh medical center are anchor tenants and they took half the building and we now train medical technicians through all their system and mellon bank 's a tenant and i love them because they pay the rent on who got into the place on probation don't give up on the poor kids because you never know what's going to happen to those children that and you will see the greenhouse that's going to open in october this year because we're going to we have a handshake with one of the large retail grocers to sell our orchids in all two hundred and forty and our partners are zuma canyon orchids which he readily agreed and we got the funding this is what i want to do when i grow up the brown building is the one you guys have been looking at and i'll tell you where i made my in life i had a chance to buy this whole industrial park which is less than one thousand feet from the riverfront for four million dollars and i didn't do it and i built the first building and guess what happened i appreciated the real estate values beyond everybody 's expectations and the owners of the park turned me down for eight i'm going to show you for a couple of minutes and said mister strickland this is in a place called the reason this picture 's in here i did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me he said man that's a great story i want one what do you do for a living he says i willie brown and so i kind of the flattery and the praise and put it out of my mind and that weekend i was going back home and herbie hancock was playing at our center that and he said as god is i've had a center like this in my mind for twenty five years and you've built it and now i really he chance you know willie brown as a matter of fact he did know willie brown and willie brown and herbie and i four years ago and we started drawing out that center on the one is called bidwell training willie brown said as sure as he got me five acres of land on san francisco bay we got an architect and we got a general contractor and we got herbie on the board center it is a vocational school for ex steel workers and and our friends from hp and our friends from steelcase and our friends from cisco and our friends from wells fargo and and along the way i met this real short slide show in the silicon valley to me afterwards he said man that's a fabulous story i want to help you and i said well thank you very much for that what do you do for a living he said well very nice thanks very much and give me your card and sometime we'll talk i didn't know ebay from that jar of water sitting on that piano but i had the presence of mind to go back and talk to one of the techie kids at my center i said hey man what is ebay he said well that's the electronic commerce network the and he left me his card so i called him up on the phone and i said mister skoll i've come to have a much deeper appreciation of who you are jeff and i did become friends the good news is i'm very aware of my responsibilities to get you out and he 's organized a team of and we're going to build this and i went down into the neighborhood called bayview hunters point and i said the mayor sent me down to work with you and i want to build a center with you but i'm not going to build you anything if you and so two hundred very angry and i started showing these pictures and after about ten pictures they all settled down of the room a woman stood up and she said in thirty five come down here and she turned that audience around on a pin and i i think we can get in the ground this year the first replication of the center and said i want to help you man let 's do one in l a and so he 's people and i've fallen in love with him as i have with herbie and with said where did the idea for centers like this come from because mister ross used to bring in your albums when i was sixteen years old when the world was all dark that's not true i believe in your hopes and your dreams i believe in your intelligence and i believe in your and i'm tired of going into town after town with people standing around on corners with eyes used to be their spirits damaged we won 't make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around and pennsylvania it costs sixty thousand dollars to keep people in jail most of whom look like me forty thousand dollars to build the university of pittsburgh medical school it's twenty thousand dollars cheaper to very decent people i think we can build these all over the country and i believe we can turn this whole story around to one of celebration in my business it's very difficult work you're always fighting upstream like never enough money too much and so there is a tendency to have an occupational depression that accompanies my work and so i've figured out the solution to the depression you make a friend made a few and in very close as and last year i spoke at his memorial service the only thing standing between you i went out and hired a student of frank lloyd wright built in a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for the life of look like the solution and not the problem as you can it and the good news is their courtyard i noticed that they had a life before you ever give them a speech and in my view is this kind of we also created a boardroom and i hired a japanese cabinetmaker from kyoto japan and commissioned him to do sixty pieces of furniture for our custom furniture for rich people and i got sixty pieces out of it for my because i felt that welfare to come to a school where there was handcrafted furniture because it sets a tone and an attitude about how you feel about people long before you give them the speech even have flowers in the hallway and they're not plastic those and we were particularly touched by the flowers and we were curious as to how the flowers got there i said well i got in my car and i went out to the what you need to know is that the children and the adults deserve flowers in their life people remember pictures long after they've we believe in hope and human possibilities and so the next thing you'll see a a million heard about my desire to build a new building because i had a cardboard box and i put it in a garbage bag and i walking all over pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site and he called me into his office which is the equivalent of going to see the wizard of john heinz had six hundred million dollars and at the time i had about he said but we've heard about you we've heard about your work with the kids and the ex steel workers and we're inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building and you could do us a great service if you would add a culinary program to your program because back then we were building a trades program he said that way we could fulfilll our affirmative action goals go into a field that i don't know much about but i promise you that if you'll support my school i'll get it built and in a couple of years i'll come back and weigh out that program that you desire said well what would your reaction be i said senator it appears that we're going into the food training business and john heinz did give me a million and most importantly he loaned me the head of research for the heinz company and we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the culinary institute of america which in their mind is kind of the harvard in this million dollar kitchen that happens to be our cafeteria pastry day why because the students made puff pastry and that's what the school ate every day the concept was that i wanted to take the stigma good food 's not for rich people good food 's for everybody on the planet and there's no excuse why we can't all be eating it so at we subsidize a gourmet lunch program for welfare in a tough neighborhood i wanted to let them know every day black kids and white and no sophistication no class no dignity no history what we've discovered is the only thing wrong with poor people is they don't have any money wednesday afternoon i was walking down happens to be a curable condition it's all in the way that you think about people that often determines by a student after seven months in the program done by a very brilliant young woman who was taught by our actually eaten seven of those baskets and they're very that's our dining room it looks like your average high school cafeteria in your average town this is my we train medical technicians for the medical industry and we train chemical technicians for companies like bayer and calgon carbon and fisher scientific and exxon and i will guarantee you that if you come to my center in pittsburgh welfare mothers doing analytical chemistry with logarithmic calculators ten months from people can't learn world class technology what we've discovered you have to give and i have children with high school diplomas that they can't read in the twenty one st century that we graduate children from schools who can't read the diplomas that they the reason is that the system gets reimbursed for the kids they spit out at the other end not the children i can take these children and in twenty weeks demonstrated aptitude the four hundred kids from the pittsburgh public school system that for arts education and these are children last year i put eighty eight percent of those kids in college and i've averaged over for fifteen years we've made a fascinating never seen anything like that before and that i figured that if treat children like human beings it increases the likelihood they're going to behave that way and why we can't institute in every school and in every city let me show you what the art room and i said what is that and he said ceramics and who are you in fact i brought in a mosaic artist from the vatican an african american woman who had studied the old vatican mosaic techniques and let me show you what sunlight teach photography four we have a world class gallery because we believe that so i designed this thing we have smoked salmon at the and i even have figured out a way to get their parents to come i couldn't buy a parent fifteen years ago so i hired a guy who got off,1,"it's a. a great honor to be here with you. the good news is I'm very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here because I'm the only thing standing between you and the bar and the good news is I don't have a prepared speech I have a box of slides of some pictures that represent my life. and what I do for a living. I've learned through experience. that people remember pictures long after they'd forgotten words. so I hope you'll remember some of the pictures I'm going to share with you for just a few minutes. the whole story really starts with me it's a high school kid in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on 4 Dead. on a Wednesday afternoon I was walking down the corridor of my high school kind of mind my own business and there was an artist teacher who made a great big old ceramic vessel and I happen to be looking in the door of the art room and if you've ever seen clay done it's magic. and I'd never seen anything like that before in my life. so I walked in the other room and I said what is that he said Ceramics and who are you but I said I'm Bill's pickle I want you to teach me that and he said we'll get your homeroom teacher I signed a piece of paper that says you can come here and I'll teach it to you and so for the remaining two years of my high school I cut all my classes. but I had the presence of mind to give the teachers classes that I cut the pottery that I made and they gave me passing grades and that's how I got out of high school and mr. Ross said you're too smart to die and I don't want it on my conscience I'm leaving the school and I'm taking you with me and he drove me out to the University of Pittsburgh will I filled out a college application at that got in on probation well I'm not a trustee of the University of it and had my installation ceremony I said. I'm the guy who came from the neighborhood who got another place on probation don't give up on the poor kids because you never know what's going to happen to those children in life. when I'm going to show you for a couple minutes is that a facility that I built in the toughest neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. what's the highest crime rate. one is called Bidwell Training Center it is a vocational school for ex co-workers and single parents and Welfare mothers remember we used to make steel in Pittsburgh well we don't make any steal any more of the people who used to make the steel for having a very tough time of it and I rebuild them and give them a new life. in Manchester craftsmen's Guild is named after my neighborhood and I was adopted by the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese during the riot and he donated The Roadhouse in that room so I started Manchester craftsmen's Guild. and I learned very quickly that wherever there are episcopalians there's money in very close proximity. and the bishop. adopted me as his kid. and last year I spoke at his memorial service and wish them well in this life. hi I went out and hired a student Frank Lloyd Wright the architect. I asked him to build me a world-class Center. and the worst neighborhood in Pittsburgh and my building was a scale model for the Pittsburgh airport and when you come to Pittsburgh and you're all invited you'll be flying into the blown-up version of my building that's the building build a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for dead and my view is that if you want to involve yourself in the life of people who have been given up on you have to look like the solution and not the problem. as you can see it has a fountain in the courtyard and the reason has a fountain in the courtyard is I wanted one and I have the checkbook so I bought but it put there and now I'm not giving speeches at conferences like bed. I got put on the board of the Carnegie Museum. NFL reception in their Courtyard I noticed that they had a farm. because they think that the people who go to the museum deserve a fountain. I think the welfare mothers and actress kids next steelworkers deserve a found in their life and so the first thing that you see in my Center in the springtime is water that greets you water is life. and water is human possibility and it sets an attitude and expectations about how you feel about people before you ever given a speech so from that I built this building. as you can see it has world-class art and it's all my taste because I raised all the money. I said to my board when you raise the body will put your taste on the wall that we have quilts and clay and calligraphy and everywhere your eye turns there's something beautiful looking back at you that's deliberate. that's intentional. in my view is as this kind of world. that can redeem the soul poor people. we also created. a boardroom and I heard a Japanese cabinet maker from Kyoto Japan and commissioned him to do 60 pieces of furniture for our building we have since been him off into his own business he's making a ton of money do a custom furniture for rich people I got 60 pieces out of it for my school because I felt it welfare moms and that's steelworkers and single parents deserve to come to a school with there was handcrafted furniture that created whenever day because it sets a tone and attitude about how you feel about people. long before you give him the speech. we even have flowers in the hallway and they're not plastic those real and they're in my building every day and now that I've given lots of speeches we had a bunch of high school principals come and see me and it said Mr Strickland what an extraordinary story what a great school and we were particularly touched by the flowers and we were curious as to how the flowers got there I said well I got him a card and went out to the greenhouse and I bought it when I brought him back and I pull in there you don't need a passport for a study group to buy flowers for your kids what you need to know is that the children and the adults deserve flowers and their life the cost is incidental bus a gesture is huge and so in my building which is full of sunlight in for flowers We Believe In Hope and human possibility that happens to be at Christmas time. and so the next thing you'll see. it's a million-dollar kitchen that was built by the Heinz company you forgive them they did all right the catch-up business and I happen to know that company pretty well because John Heinz who is our US senator who was tragically killed in a plane accident and heard about my desire to build a new building cuz I had a cardboard box and put in a garbage bag and I was walking over to Pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site and he called me into his office which is the equivalent of going to see The Wizard of Oz John Hinds at $600 and at the time I had to buy 60 sack he said but we've heard about you and heard about your work with the kids and the ex steelworkers. they weren't tied the One support your desire to build a new building. and you could do us a great service if you would add a culinary program. to your program because back then we were Building Trades program they said that way we could fulfill our formative action go to the Heinz company instead syndrome reluctant. the go into a field that I don't know much about but I promise you that if you'll support my school I'll get it built in a couple years I'll come back and where that program that you desire and Sandra Hein so I'm sat very quietly he said well what would your answer be if I said I'd give you a million dollars I said send it appears that we're going into the food training business. and John Heinz good give me a million bucks and most importantly he'll only the head of research for the Heinz company and we kind of borrowed the curriculum from The Culinary Institute of America with your mind is kind of the harbor to cooking school that we created at Gourmet Cooks the program for welfare mothers in this million-dollar Kitchen in the middle of the Earth City and was never look back. I would like to show you now some of the food that these welfare mothers do. can this million-dollar catching that happens to be our cafeteria line that's puff pastry day why because the students made puff pastry and that's what the school day everyday. but the concept was that I wanted to take the stigma out of food that good foods not for rich people good food for everybody on the planet and there's no excuse why we all can't be eating it so at my school we subsidize a gourmet lunch program for welfare mothers in the middle of the inner city because we've discovered that it's good for their stomachs but it's better for their heads because I wanted to let them know every day of their life that they have value at this place I call my sister. we have students and sit together black kids and white kids and what we've discovered is. you can solve the race problem. by creating a world-class environment because people will have a tendency to show you world-class Behavior if you treat them in that way. this is examples of the two that welfare mothers are doing after 6 months in the training program no sophistication no class no diggity no history what we've discovered is the only thing wrong with poor people if they don't have any money which happens to be a curable Condition it's all in the way that you think about peoples and often determines their behavior that is done by a student after 7 months in the program done by a very brilliant young woman who was taught by our pastry chef I've actually eaten seven of those baskets and they're very good and they have no calories. that's our dining room. it looks like your average high-school cafeteria in your average town in America but this is my view of how students are to be treated with check the little ones have been pushed aside. we trained pharmaceutical technician for the pharmacy industry. we trained medical technicians for the medical industry. and we trade chemical technician for companies like bear and Calgon carbon and Fisher Scientific an Exxon and I will guarantee you if you come to my Center in Pittsburgh and you're all invited you'll see welfare mothers to an analytical chemistry with logarithmic calculators 10 months from enrollment in the program there is absolutely no reason. why poor people can't learn world-class technology what we've discovered is. you have to give them flowers and sunlight into food and expectation. and herpes music and you can cure spiritual cancer. every time. who trains corporate travel agents for the travel industry will even teach people how to read with the kid with a red stripe. was in the program two years ago he's now an instructor and I have children with high school diplomas that they can read. and so you must ask yourself the question how is it possible in the 21st century. that we graduate children from schools who can't read the diplomas that they have in their hands. the reason is that the system get reimbursed for the kids if they spit out the other end not the children who read I can take these children and in 20-week demonstrated aptitude I can get them High School equivalent no big deal. that's our library with more handcrafted furniture. and this is the arch program I started a 1968 remember I'm the black kid from the sixties who got his life saved with Ceramics why I went out and decided to reproduce my experience with other kids in the neighborhood is very big if you get sketched flowers to give them food and the gum Sunshine of the Suzy azzam you can bring it right back to life I have 400 cash in the Pittsburgh public school system the come to me every day of the week for Arts education and these are children who are flunking out of public school and last year I put 88% of those kids in college have averaged over 80%. fifteen years we may have fascinating discovery. there's nothing wrong with the kids there's a faction. and sunshine and food in the Suzy azzam and Herbie's music can cure for that I want a big man of the year in education of beat out all the phds because I figured that if you treat children like human beings and increases the likelihood they going to behave that way and why we can Institute that policy and every school. in every city and every town remains a mystery to me. let me show you what these people do we have ceramics and photography and computer Imaging at least we're all kids with no artistic ability no-talent no imagination and we bringing the world's greatest artist Gordon Parks has been there Chester Higgins has been there and what we've learned is that the children will become like the people who teach them in fact I brought in a mosaic artists from the Vatican and African-American woman who has studied the old Fabric in Mosaic techniques and let me show you what they did with the work fees were children through the whole world had given up on your fucking out of public school and that's what they're capable of doing was affection and sunlight in food and good music and confidence. we teach photography and this is examples of some of the kids work. that boy won a four-year scholarship in the scratch that photograph. what's our Gallery we have a world-class Gallery because we believe that poor kids need a world-class Gallery so I designed this thing we have smoked salmon at the art openings have a formal printed invitation and I even have figured out a way to get their parents to come I couldn't buy a pair of 15 years ago so I heard a guy who got off in the Jesus big time he was dragging guys out of bars and saving those flyers for the Lord and I said bill I want to hire you man you have to come down to Jesus stuff a little bit to keep the enthusiasm I can't get these parents to come to the school and he said I'll get them to come to the school so I jumped in the van and went to miss Jones's house is in Miss Jones I knew you wanted to come to your kids art opening but you probably didn't have a ride so I came to give you a ride and he got 10 parents in the 20 parents the last show that we did. two-headed parents showed up and we didn't pick up one parent because now it's become socially not acceptable not to show up to support your children at the Manchester craftsmen's Guild because people think you're a bad parent and there is no statistical difference. between the white parents and the black parents Mother's will go where the children are being celebrated every time every time every city. wanted you to see this Gallery because it's as good as it gets and by the time I cut these kids lose from high school they've got four shows on the resume before they apply to college because it's all up here. you have to change the way that people see themselves before you can change their behavior and it's worked out pretty good up to this day I even stuck up another room on the building which I'd like to show you this is brand-new we just got the slide done in time for the Ted conference I gave this little slideshow at a place called the Silicon Valley and I did all right in the woman came out of the artist you so that was a great story and I was very impressed with your presentation my only criticism as your computers are getting a little bit old. and I said well what do you do for a living she said why work for a company car Hewlett-Packard. I said you're on the computer business and she said yes sir I said well there's an easy solution to that problem while I'm very pleased to announce to you that HP had a furniture company called steel case of adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology and all their furniture for the United States of America and that's the room that's initiating the relationship that we got to just done in time to show you so it's kind of the world debut here by Digital Imaging Center. I only have a couple more slides and this is where the story gets kind of interesting so I just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes and you'll understand why he's there and I'm here. in 1986 I had the presence of mind to stick on Music Hall on the north end of the building walls building. and a guy named Dizzy Gillespie showed up. the play there because he knew this man over here Marty Ashby and I stood on that stayed with Dizzy Gillespie on soundcheck on a Wednesday afternoon and I said why would you come to a black run Center in the middle of an industrial park with a high crime rate that doesn't even have a reputation in music he said because I heard you built the center and I didn't believe that you did it and I want to see for myself and now that I have. I want to give you a gift I said you're the gift he said no sir. you're the gift and I'm going to allow you to record the concert I'm going to give you the music and if you ever choose to sell it you must sign an agreement that says the money will come back and sports School. and I recorded the Z and he died a year later but not before telling a felony McCoy Tyner what we were doing and he showed up and said there's he talked about you all over the country man and I want to help you then I got it wouldn't Marcellus showed up that a bass player named Ray Brown and a fella named Stanley Turrentine piano player named Herbie Hancock and and the band called The Count Basie Orchestra. and Covenant Tito Puente and a guy named Gary Burton. Shirley horn Betty Carter and Dakota Staton and Nancy Wilson. always come to this Center in the middle of an industrial park to sold-out audiences. middle of the inner city and I'm very pleased to tell you that were there permission I have now accumulated 600 recordings of the greatest artists in the world including Joe Williams. who died. but not before his last recording was done at my school. and Joe Williams. came up to me. and he put his hand on my shoulder and he said done. thoughts picture man. do the squirt. and I want my music to be with you. and that worked out all right. when the Basie Band came they the band got so excited about the school they voted to give me the rights for the music and I recorded it and we won something called a Grammy and like a fool I didn't go to the ceremony. well we did win their name was literally in lights over Madison Square Garden. you and Jazz Orchestra drop by and we recorded them and got nominated for a second Grammy back-to-back. so we become one of the hot young Jazz recording studios United States of America. and the melody and the city was a high crime rate that place all filled up with. Republicans. if you drop the bomb on that Remy to wipe out all the money in Pennsylvania cuz it was all sitting there. including my mother and father whose live long enough to see their kid feel that building. and they're dizzy just like I told you he was there and he was there Tito Puente. Pat Metheny Jim Hall were there and they recorded with us. and that was our first recording studio which was the broom closet and we put the mops in the hallway and re-engineer the thing and that's where we recorded the first Grammy and this is our new facility which is all video technology and that is a room that was built for a woman named Nancy Wilson. who recorded that album at our school last Christmas and then if you happen to be watching Oprah Winfrey on Christmas day he was there and Nancy was there singing excerpt from this album the rights to which she donated to our school and I can now tell you with absolute certainty that an appearance on Oprah Winfrey will sell 10,000 CDs we are currently number 4 on the Billboard charts right behind Tony Bennett. and I think we're going to be fine this was burned out there on the ride since is next to my building and so I had another cardboard box building I walked back out the streets again and that's the building and that's the model and on the rights of high-tech Greenhouse in the middle of the medical technology building and I'm very pleased to tell you that the buildings done it's also full of anchor tenants at $20 a foot triple net to know the inner city and there's the fountain. every building has a fountain and the University of Pittsburgh medical center or anchor tenants they took half the building and we now trained medical technicians for all their system and melon Max a tenant and I love them because they pay the rent on time and that's the result of the association I'm now a director of the mammoth Financial Corporation. that box right. and this is in the process of being built as we speak multiply that picture times for and you will see the greenhouse that's going to open in October this year because we're going to throw those flowers in the middle of the inner city and we're going to have high school kids growing phalaenopsis orchids in the middle of the inner city. and we have a handshake was one of the large retail Grocers to sell orchids and all 240 stores in six days and our part is a Zuma Canyon orchids of Malibu California who are Hispanic so the Hispanics in the black folks are formed a partnership to grow high-technology orchids in the middle of the inner city and I told my United States stay there that there was a very high probability that he could find some funding for this we would become a left-hand column in the Wall Street Journal the which she readily agreed and we got the funding we open in the fall and you got to come see it it's going to be a hell of a story. and. this is what I want to do when I grow up the Brown building is the one you guys been looking at and I'll tell you where I made my big mistake I had a chance to buy this whole Industrial Park which is less than 1000 feet from the riverfront for $4000000 and I didn't do it and I built the first building and guess what happened I appreciated the real estate values be on everybody's expectations and the owners of the park turn me down for 8 million dollars last year and said Mr Strickland you are to get the Civic leader of the Year award because you've appreciated our property values beyond our wildest expectations thank you very much for that. the moral of the story is you must be prepared to act on your dreams. just in case they do come true. and finally there's this picture. this is in a place called San Francisco in the reason this pictures in here is I did this fly to a couple years ago at a big economic Summit and it was a felon the audience you came up to me you said man that's a great story I want one of those I said well I'm very flattered what are you do for a living he says I run the city of San Francisco my name is Willie Brown. and so I kind of accepted the flattery and the phrase and put it out of my mind on that weekend I was going back home. can Herbie Hancock was playing our Center then. first time I met him when he walked in and he says what is this. and I said Herbie this is my concept of a training center for poor people. and he said as God is my witness. I've had a son of like this in my mind for 25 years and you've built is not really want built one that's it what where would you build this thing he said San Francisco I sent you know Willy Brown as a matter of fact he did know Willy Brown and Willie Brown and her be and I had dinner for years ago we started throwing out that Center on the tablecloth and Willie Brown said if Shores on the mayor of San Francisco. I want to build this thing as a legacy to the poor people of this city and he got me five acres of land on San Francisco Bay and we got an architect and we got a general contractor and we got her pee on the board and our friends from HP and her friends and Steelcase and her friends from Cisco and her friend from Wells Fargo and Genentech in along the way I met this real short guy at my slideshow in the Silicon Valley he came up to me afterwards he said man that's a fabulous story I want to help you I said well. Thank you very much for that what you do for a living he said well I build a company called eBay that's the one that's very nice thanks very much and give me a card and sometimes we'll talk I didn't know anybody from that. jar water sitting on that Deanna but I had the presence of mind to go back and talk to one of the kids at the center that's just a man what is eBay he said about the electronic Commerce Network as to why method guy Bill to say. and you left me his card so I called him up on the phone and I said Mr stole I've come to have a much deeper appreciation of Who You Are. and I'd like to become your friend and Jeff and I did become friends. and he's organized a team of people and we're going to build this Center. and I went down into the neighborhood. call Bayview Hunters Point and I said the marriage sent me down here to work with you. and I want to build a center with you but I'm not going to build you anything if you don't want it. and all I got two boxes slides. and so I stood up in front of 200 very angry very disappointed people in a summer night. and the air conditioner had broken and it was 100�� outside. and I started showing these pictures and after about 10 pictures they all settled down and I ran the story and I said what do you think and of the back of the room a woman stood up and she said it was 35 years and living in this god-forsaken place. you're the only person that's come down here and treated us with dignity I'm going with you man and she turned that audience around on a pin and I promised these people that I was going to build this thing and we're going to build it all right and I think we can get in the ground this year. as the first replication of the center in Pittsburgh but I met a guy named Quincy Jones along the way. can I show them the box of flies and Quincy said I want to help you man. let's do one in LA and so he's assembled a group of people and I've fallen in love with him as I have with her be and with this music and Quincy said where did the idea. for sinners like this come from that I said it came from your music man because mr. Ross used to bring in your albums when I was 16 years old and the pottery class. when the world was all dark. and your music got me to the semi and I said if I can follow that music I'll get out into the sunlight. and I'll be okay. and if that's not true. I like it here. I want you all to know. did I think the world is a place that's worth living I believe in you. I believe in your hopes and your dreams I believe in your intelligence and I believe in your enthusiasm and I'm tired of living like this. going into town after town with people standing around corners with. holes where eyes used to be their Spirits damage. we won't make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around and Pennsylvania cost $60,000 to keep people in jail most of them looks like me. it's $40,000 to go to the University of Pittsburgh medical school it's $20,000 cheaper to go to medical school to keep people in jail do the math. it'll never work I am banking on you and I'm banking on guys like Herbie and Quincy. and Hackett and Richard and very decent people. who still believe in something. and I want to do this in my lifetime. and every city. and every time and I don't think I'm crazy I think we can get home on this thing and I think we can build these all over the country for less money than we're spending on prisons and I believe we can turn this whole story around to 10 celebration. and one of Hope in my business it's very difficult work you're always fighting Upstream like a salmon never enough money too much need. and so there is a tendency to have an occupational depression of the company's my work and so I figured out over time the solution to the depression. you make the friend. and every town. and you'll never be lonely. My Hope Is that I've made a few here tonight and thanks for listening to what I had to say",0.73046875,
60,BillyGraham_1998.sph.wav,but death is inevitable i spoke some time ago to a joint session of congress last year and we were meeting in that room why they have a speaker from the field of religion about three hundred of them and i said there 's one thing that we have in common in this room all of us together whether republican or democrat i said we 're all going to die and we have that in common with all these great men of the past that are staring down at us and it's often difficult for young people to understand that as the ancient writer of ecclesiastes wrote he said there's every activity under heaven there's a time to be born the deathbed of several famous people whom you would know seen them in those agonizing moments when they were scared to and yet a few years earlier death never i talked to a woman this past week richard can answer that was a famous doctor never thought of god never talked about god didn't believe in god he was an atheist as he came to because he made that decision and he said for the first time in his life he'd thought about and about god what is the greatest surprise in your life and i said the greatest surprise in my life is the brevity of life passes so in the aftermath of world war ii concluded quote science and religion are not antagonists on the contrary he put it on a personal basis i knew doctor von braun very well and he said speaking for myself i can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos serves only to confirm a belief in the certainty of a creator he also said in our search to know god i've come to believe that the life of jesus christ should be the focus of our efforts and inspiration the reality of this life and his resurrection is the hope of mankind i've done a lot of speaking in germany and in france and in different parts of the world one hundred and five countries it's been my privilege to speak in and i was invited one day to visit and he once and he said to me he said young man he said do you believe in the resurrection of jesus christ and on that elevator a man said i hear billy graham is staying in this hotel and i said sir i do he said so do i he said when i leave office i'm going to spend my time writing a book on why jesus christ rose again and why it's so important to believe that in one of his plays alexander solzhenitsyn depicts a man dying who says to those gathered around his bed the moment when it's terrible to feel regret is when one is dying how should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying another man looked in my direction and said yes there he is he 's on this elevator with us and this man looked me up and down for about ten seconds and he said my what an at the frontiers of mathematics even as a teenager he is viewed by many as the the probability theory and a creator of the first model of a computer and of course you are all familiar with the computer language named for him he was astounded at the phenomenon we've been considering that yet they also are full of anger hypocrisy and have and self hatreds pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture of genius and self delusion four had a profound he wrote in his journal these i submit myself to jesus christ my redeemer a french historian said two centuries later seldom has so mighty an intellect that his own sins and failures could be forgiven and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven he experienced it in a way that went beyond scientific observation and reason it was he who penned the well known words the heart has its reasons which reason knows not equally well known is pascal 's wager essentially he said this if you bet on open yourself to his love you lose nothing even if you're wrong but if instead you bet that there is no god the knowledge of god was far beyond anything that ever crossed his mind when he died at the age of thirty nine to be seventy a long time in his era yet he too had to face death and he wrote these words i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no for you are with me this was david 's answer to three dilemmas of evil suffering and death and allow him to fill your life when i was seventeen years of age i was born and reared on a farm in north carolina i milked cows every morning and i had to milk the same cows every evening when i came home i hope that you won 't feel that these few moments with me is not a is an anticlimax after all this tremendous and i worked on the farm and tried to keep up with my studies good grades in high school i didn't make them in college until one day i was faced face to face the way the truth and the can you imagine that i am the truth i'm the embodiment of all truth he was a liar or he was insane or he was what he claimed to be i had to make that decision but by faith i said i believe him and he came into my heart when i hear that call to go into the presence of god thank you and god bless all of you on an airplane in the east some years ago and the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of charlotte north carolina his name was john belk some of you will probably know him and there was a drunk man on and he got up out of his seat two or three times and he was making everybody upset by what he was trying to do and he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went and everybody was upset with him and finally john belk said do you know who 's sitting here man and he turned to me and he said he said your sermons have certainly helped and i suppose that that's true with thousands of people i know that as you have been peering into the future and as we've heard some of it here tonight i would like to live in that age and see what is going to be but i because i'm eighty years old this is my and i know that my time is brief i have phlebitis at the moment in both legs and some other problems that i won 't talk about this is not the first time that we've had a technological revolution in one generation the nation of the people of israel a tremendous and dramatic change that made them a great power a man by the name of david came to the throne and king david became one of the great leaders of his generation brilliant poet soldier with strategies in battle and conflict that people study even today but they wouldn't allow the israelis to look into it or to have any but david changed all of and he introduced the iron age to israel and the bible says that david laid up great stores of which archaeologists have found that in present day palestine there are evidences of that generation now instead of crude tools made of sticks and stones israel now had iron as a clergyman and in the course of one generation israel was completely changed the introduction of iron in some ways had an impact you can imagine how out of place there were many problems that technology could not solve and they're still with us and you haven't solved them and i haven't heard anybody here speak to that how do we solve these three problems that i'd like to mention the first one that david saw was human evil how do we solve it and again in the psalms which gladstone said was the greatest book in the world i feel like a fish out of david describes the evils of the human and yet he says he restores my soul have you ever thought about what a contradiction we on one hand we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology as this conference vividly demonstrates we've seen under the hundreds of billions of years out in the future an owl out of the air our battleships our soldiers on a frontier now almost ready to go to war why do we have these wars in every generation and in every part of the world and revolutions we can't get along with other people even in our own families find ourselves in the paralyzing grip of self destructive habits we can't break and injustice and violence sweep our world bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and i was preaching in san jose some time ago and my friend mark kvamme who helped introduce me to this conference even the most sophisticated among us seem powerless to break this cycle i would like to see oracle work on this how do we change man the bible says the problem is within us within our hearts and our souls which we call god and we need to have our souls restored jesus said for out of the heart come evil thoughts false testimonies slander the british philosopher bertrand russell was not a religious man but he said it 's in our hearts that the evil lies and it's from our hearts that it must be plucked out albert einstein mister einstein he didn't have a doctor 's degree because he said nobody was qualified to give him easier to denature plutonium to denature the evil spirit of man brought several ceos and leaders of some of the companies here in the silicon valley to have breakfast with me or i with them and many of you i'm sure have thought about that and puzzled over it you've seen people take beneficial technological advances such as the internet we've heard about tonight and twist them into something the oklahoma city bombing was simple technology the problem is the person or persons using it king david said that he knew the depths of his own soul that included murder yet king david sought god 's forgiveness and said you can restore my soul the bible teaches that we're more than a body and we are that's the part of us that yearns for god or something more we find in technology your soul is that part of you that yearns for meaning in life and which seeks for something beyond this life it's the part of you that yearns really for god i find young people all over the world are searching for something they don't know what it is i speak at many universities oxford i've spoken at all of those universities i'm going to harvard in about three or four no it's about two months from now to give a lecture and the same questions that i was asked the last few times i've been on these few questions i come from why am i here where am i going what's life all about why am i here and i was so stimulated and had such it was an even if you have no religious belief there are times when you wonder that there's something else thomas edison also said when you see everything that happens in the world of science and in the working of the universe you cannot deny that there's a captain on the bridge i went to ambassador dobrynin whom i knew very well and i'd been to russia several times under the communists and they'd given me marvelous freedom that i didn't expect going to sit beside misters and he surprised me with the answer he said talk to her about religion and philosophy that's what she's really interested in i was a little bit surprised but that evening that's what we talked about and it was a stimulating conversation eye opening experience and afterward she said you know i'm an atheist but i know that there's something up there higher than we are the second problem that king david writing the oldest book in the world was job and he said man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward to hear them talk a few months i'll be eighty years of age i admit that i'm very grateful for all the medical advances that have kept me in relatively good health all these years about the world that is yet to come i haven't given a talk in and when you speak as much as i do three or four times a day every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere through technology got some notes here so that which i do sometimes i've got something i can turn to but even here among us in the most advanced society in the world we have poverty and science friends that betray us unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us i've never met a person in the world that didn't have a problem or a worry why do we suffer it's an age old question that we haven't yet david again and again said that he would turn to god he said the lord is my shepherd the problem that david knew he could not solve was death i know that we're near the end of this conference many commentators have said that death is the forbidden subject of our generation most people live as if going to die we see people on our screens marilyn monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person and our many young people think she's they don't know that she's dead or clark gable or whoever it is and some of you may be wondering the old stars they come to life,1,is a clergyman. you can imagine how out of place I feel I feel like a fish out of water. I'll maybe an owl out of the air. I was preaching in San Jose some time ago and my friend Mark Kwame. who helped introduce me to this conference. brought several CEOs and leaders of some of the companies here in the Silicon Valley to have breakfast with me or I wear them. and David So stimulated. and had such if it was an eye-opening experience to hear them talk about the world that is yet to come. through technology and science. I know that we're near the end of this conference and some of you may be wondering why they have a speaker from the field of religion. Richard cancel that because he made that decision but some years ago I was on an elevator in Philadelphia coming down I was to address a conference at a hotel. and on that elevator a man said I hear Billy Graham is staying in this hotel and another man looked in my direction said yes there is he's on this elevator weather and this man look me up and down for about 10 seconds and he said my what an anticlimax I hope. I hope that you won't feel that these two moments with me is not a is an anti-climax after all this tremendous. Hawks that you heard from the dresses which I intend to listen to every one of them but I was. on an airplane in the East some years ago. and the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of Charlotte North Carolina his name is John built some of you would probably know him. and there was a drunk man on that and he got up out of his seat two or three times and he was making everybody upset by what he was trying to do it he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went by. and everybody was upset with him. and finally John Belk said you know who's sitting here and the man's in there he said it's Billy Graham preacher he said you and he turned to me and he said put her there he said your sermons have certainly helped me and I suppose that if that's true with thousands of people. I know that those you have been peering into the future and is we've heard some of it here tonight. I would like to live in that age and see what is going to be. but I won't because I'm 80 years old lies this is my idea of here. and I know that my time is brief. I have plenty this at the moment and both legs. and that's the reason I had to have a little help in getting up here because I have Parkinson's disease in addition to that and some other problems that I won't talk about. but this is not the first time that we've had a technological Revolution. we've had others. and there's one that I want to talk about. in one generation the nation of the people of Israel. had a tremendous and dramatic change that made them a great power in the near East. a man by the name of David came to the throne. I'm King David became one of the great leaders of his generation. he was a man of tremendous leadership. he had the favor of God with him. he was a poet philosopher. writer soldier with strategies in battle and conflict with people study even today. but about two centuries before David. the Hittites. had discovered the secret of smelting and processing of iron. and slowly that skills spread but they wouldn't allow the Israelis. to look into it all to have any. but David changed all of that and introduced the Iron Age to Israel and the Bible says that David laid up great stores of iron in which archaeologists have found that in present-day Palestine their evidences of that generation. now instead of crude tools. made of sticks and stones. Israel now had iron plows and sickles and hoes. military weapons and in the course of one generation. Israel was completely changed. the introduction of iron in some ways had an impact. a little bit like the microchip has had on our generation. and. David found that there were many problems that technology could not solve there were many problems. still left. and they're still brothers and you haven't solved and I haven't heard anybody here speak to that how do we solve these three problems and I'd like to mention. the first one that David saw was human evil. what does it come from. how to resolve it over again and again in the Psalms which Gladstone said was the greatest book in the world. David describes the evils of the human race and yet he says he restores my soul. have you ever thought about what a contradiction wheel. on one hand we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe and dramatically push back the frontiers of Technology as this conference vividly demonstrates. we've seen under the seat or three miles down or Galaxy's hundreds of billions of years out in the future. but on the other hand. something is wrong. all battleships. I'll soldiers. are on a frontier now almost ready to go to war with Iraq why do we have these wars and every generation and part of the world and revolutions. we can't get along with other people even in our own families we find ourselves in the paralyzing grip of self-destructive habits We Can't Break racism and Injustice and violence sweep our world bringing a tragic Harvest of heartache and death. even the most sophisticated Among Us seem powerless to break this cycle I would like to see Oracle take up that. some other technological. Geniuses work on this how do we change man. so that he doesn't lie and cheat and newspapers are not filled with stories or frogs in business or label Athletics or wherever. the Bible says the problem is within us within our hearts and our souls. a problem is and we're separated from our creator. which we call God I'm we need to have our souls restored. something only God can do Jesus said for out of the heart come evil thoughts murders sexual immorality Theft V testimony slender. the British philosopher Bertrand Russell was not a religious man. but he said it's in our hearts that the evil lies and it's from our hearts that it must be plucked out Albert Einstein I was just talking to someone when I was speaking at Princeton. not met mr. Einstein didn't have a doctor's degree because he said nobody was qualified to give him one. but he made the statement he said it's easier to denature plutonium that the nature of the evil spirit of man. and many of you I'm sure have thought about that and puzzled over it. you've seen people take beneficial technological advances such as the internet with heard about tonight and twist them into something. corrupting you've seen bringing people device computer viruses that bring down whole system's the Oklahoma City bombing with simple technology horribly used the problem is not technology the problem is the person or persons using it. King David said. but he knew the depth of his own so he couldn't free himself from personal problems on personal evils that included murder and adultery. yep King David sought God's forgiveness and said you can restore my soul is in the Bible teaches that we're moving a body and a mind. we are a soul. and there's something inside of us that is beyond our understanding. that's the part of us that yearns for God or something more than we find in technology your soul is that part of you that yearns from meaning in life and what's 6 plus something Beyond this life it's the part of you that you learned really for God I find young people all over the world are searching for something. they don't know what it is I speak at many universities. and I have many questions and answer. Some weather at Cambridge or Harvard. Oxford apartment all those universities I'm going to Harvard and about three or four know it's about 2 months from now to give a lecture and I'll be ask the same questions that I was at the Last Supper and it'll be on these questions where did I come from why am I here where am I going what's life all about quite a my here. even if you have no religious belief there are times when you wonder that there's something else Thomas Edison also said when you at see everything that happens in the world of science and in the working of the universe you cannot deny that there's a captain on the bridge. I remember once I sat beside mrs. Gorbachev. at the White House dinner. I went to ambassadors bringing whom I knew very well and I've been to Russia several times. under the Communists and they'd given me marvelous Freedom that I didn't expect. and I knew mr. Bring him very well and I said I'm going to sit beside mrs. Gilbertsville tonight what should I talk to her about and he surprised me with Aunt he said talk to her about religion and philosophy that's what she's really interested in. I was a little bit surprised but that evening that's what we talked about and it was a stimulating conversation and afterward she said you know I'm an atheist but I know that there's something up there higher than we are. the second problem that King David realized he could not solve was the problem of human suffering writing the oldest book in the world was Joe and he said man is Born Into Trouble as the Sparks Fly upward. yes to be sure science has done much to push back certain types of human suffering. in a few months I'll be eighty years of age admit that I'm very grateful for all the medical advances that have kept me in relatively good health all these years my doctors at the Mayo Clinic Guardsmen not to take this trip out here to this to be here I haven't given a talk and nearly four months. and when you get off speak as much as I do three or four times a day. you get rusty that's the reason I'm using this Podium and using these notes. every time you ever hear me on the television will somewhere I'm ad-libbing. I'm not reading I never read an address I never read a speech or talk or I'll let you. apocalyptic. but tonight I've got some notes here so that if I begin to forget which I do sometimes. I've got something I can turn to. but even here Among Us. most. in the most advanced Society in the world we have poverty with. family sits self-destruct friends that betrayus unbearable psychological precious Bell down on us I've never met a person in the world that didn't have a problem or I'll worry. why do we suffer it's an age-old question that we haven't answered. yeah David again and again said. Betty would turn to God he said the Lord is my shepherd. the final. problem that David knew he could not saw was death. many commentators have said that death is the forbidden subject of Our Generation most people live as if they're never going to die. technology projects the myth of control over our immortality. we see people on ice cream Marilyn Monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she wasn't person and many young people think she still alive. they don't know that she's dead or Clark Gable whoever it is the old stars that come to life. and there. they're just as great on that screen as they were in person. but death is inevitable. I spoke some time ago too. a joint session of Congress last year. and we were meeting in that room the statue room about 300 of them with that. and I said there's one thing that we have in common in this room all of us together whether Republican or Democrat and whoever. I said we're all going to die and we have that in common with all these Great Men of the past that is staring down at us. and it's often difficult for young people to understand that. it's difficult for them to understand that they are going to die. as the ancient Rite of Ecclesiastes wrote. he said there's every activity under Heaven there's a time to be born. and there's a time to die. I've stood at the deathbed of several famous people on you with no. I'll talk to them I've seen them in those agonizing moments when they were scared to death. and yet a few years earlier. death never cross their mind. I'll talk to a woman this past week. whose father. was a famous doctor. she said he never thought of God never talked about God didn't believe in God he was an atheist. but she said. as it came to.. He set up in the side of the bed one day in the ask the nurse if he could see the chaplain. and he said for the first time in his life he thought about. the inevitable. and about God.. Was there a God. a few years ago University student asked me. what is the greatest surprise in your life and I said the greatest surprise in my life is the brevity of life. it passes so fast. but it does not need to have to be that way. in the aftermath of World War 2 concluded quote science and religion I'm not antagonist on the contrary their sisters. he put it on a personal basis on you Doctor Von Braun very well. and he said speaking for myself I can only say that the Grandeur of the cosmos serves only to confirm a belief in the certain day of a Creator he also said and I'll search to know God I've come to believe that the life of Jesus Christ should be the focus of our efforts and inspiration the reality of this life and his resurrection is the hope of mankind. I've done a lot of speaking in Germany and in France and in different parts of the world 105 countries it's been my privilege to speak in. I was invited one day to visit. Chancellor Adenauer. who is looked upon as saw the founder of modern Germany. since the war. and he wants and he said to me he said young man he said do you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. and I said sir I do. he said so do I he said when I leave office I'm going to spend my time writing a book on quad Jesus Christ rose again and why it's so important to believe that. in one of his plays Alexander solzhenitsyn. depicts a man dying who says to those gathered around his bed the moment when it's terrible to feel regret this when one is dying. how should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying. Blaise Pascal ask exactly that question in seventeenth-century France Pascal has been called the architect of modern civilization. he was a brilliant scientist at the frontiers of mathematics even as a teenager. he is viewed by many as the founder of the probability Theory. how to creator of the first model of a computer. and of course you're all familiar with the computer language named for him Pascal explored in-depth human dilemmas of evil suffering and death. he was astounded at the phenomenon we've been considering that people can achieve extraordinary Heights and science the Arts and human in the prize yet they also full of anger hypocrisy and half and self-hatred Pascal sauce has a remarkable mixture of genius and self-delusion on November 23rd 1654 Pascal had a profound religious experience. he wrote in his journal these words. I submit myself absolutely to Jesus Christ my redeemer two centuries later seldom has some mighty fine until I submitted with such humility to the authority of Jesus Christ. Pascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of God could bring us back into harmony. but he believed. but his own sins and failures could be forgiven and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven. experienced it in a way that went beyond scientific observation and reason it was he who penned the well-known words. the heart has its reasons which reason knows not all. equally well-known is Pascal's wager essentially he said this if you bet on God. and open yourself to his love you lose nothing but even if you're wrong. but if instead you bet that there is no God then you can lose it all in this life and the life to come. call Pascal scientific knowledge paled beside the knowledge of God the knowledge of God was far beyond anything that ever crossed his mind he was ready to face him when he died at the age of 39. King David live to be 70 a long time in his hero yet he too had to face death and he wrote these words even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for you are with me this was David's answer to 3 dilemmas of evil suffering and death it can be yours. as well as you seek the Living God and allow him to feel your life and give you hope for the future. when I was 17 years of age. I was born and raised on a farm in North Carolina I milked cows every morning and had the most the same cows every evening when I came home from school. and there were 20 of them that I had that I was responsible for. and I worked on a farm. and tried to keep up with my studies. I didn't make good grades in high school. I didn't make them in college until. something happened in my heart. one day I was face to face to face. with Christ he said I'm the way the truth and the life. can you imagine that I am the truth and then bottom of all truth. he was a liar. or he was insane. oh he was what he playing to be which was. I had to make that decision I couldn't prove it. I couldn't take it to a laboratory and experiment with it but by faith I said I believe him. and it came into my heart. and changed my life and now I'm ready. when I hear that call. to go into the presence of God thank you and God bless all of you. thank you for the Pigman,0.69921875,

Thank you and that way I can have a greater impact on the world this man Joel salatin they called a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system since I'm homeschooled I want to go from Steve one day. this man this lunatic farmer doesn't use any pesticides or herbicides or genetically modified seeds and so forth at his called Crazy by the system. I want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices by buying our food directly from local farmers or neighbors we know in real life. how do you say organic or local food is more expensive but isn't really with all these things I've been learning about the food system it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer or we can pay the hospital.I know definitely which one I would choose I want you to know that their phones out there until care in Sequatchie Coast farms in Tennessee whose cows doing grass just need to do on the mud just like I thought. Bill's Farm and volunteer so I can see up close and personal with the meat comes from. I want you to know that I believe kids with fresh vegetables and good food in or more about it and it really comes from I want you to know that their farmers markets in every Community popping up I want you to know that me and my brother sister acting like eating baked kale chips I try to share this Everywhere I Go. not too long ago my uncle said that he offered my six year old cousin cereal she has to be one organic Tostitos with a sugar-coated flakes you know the one is a big strapping cartoon character on the. my little cousin told his dad that he would rather have you again until you know cereal because Brooke said he's too nice sparkly cereal. and that my friend is how we can make a difference one kid at a time so next time you're at the grocery store think local shoes are getting to know your thoughts and know your food thank you.25% of the world's Food Supplies lost spoilage 458 billion dollars worth every year. so we can know how far to travel monitor temperature all the way to the market we make it safer that's what I'm working on.,0.75,
62,BjarkeIngels_2009G.sph.wav,and the buildings they don't only sort of invoke the imagery of the mountains they also operate like mountains they create shelter from the wind they accumulate the solar energy they accumulate the water so they actually transform the entire island into a single ecosystem so we recently presented the master plan and it has gotten approved and this summer we are starting the construction documents of the two first mountains in what's going to be the first carbon neutral island in the cliche of the radical architect is the sort of angry young man rebelling against the establishment or this idea of the misunderstood genius frustrated that the world doesn't fit in with his or her ideas so in a way you can see how the mountain in copenhagen sort of evolved into the seven peaks of azerbaijan with a little luck and some more evolution maybe in ten years it could be the five mountains of on mars thank you rather than revolution we're much more interested in evolution this idea that things gradually evolve by adapting and improvising to the his famous evolutionary tree could almost be a diagram of the way we work as you can see a project evolves through a series of generations of design meetings about architecture quite often just stays on contemplating the final result sort of the architectural object is the latest tower in london a gherkin or a sausage or a at each meeting there's way too many ideas only the best ones can survive and through a process of architectural selection we might choose a really beautiful model or we might have a very functional model we mate them they have sort of mutant offspring and through these sort of generations of design meetings we arrive at a design a very literal way of showing it is a project we did for a library and a hotel in copenhagen the design process was like really tough almost like a struggle for survival but gradually an idea evolved this sort of idea of a rational tower that melts together with the surrounding city but darwin doesn't only explain the evolution of a single idea as you can see sometimes a subspecies branches off and quite often we sit in a design meeting and we discover that this great idea it doesn't really work in this context but for another client in another culture it could really be the right answer to a different question so as a result we never throw anything out we keep our office almost like an archive of architectural biodiversity you never know when you might need it and what i'd like to do now in an act of warp speed story telling is tell the story of how two projects evolved by adapting and improvising to the happenstance of the world the first story starts last year when we went to shanghai to do the competition for the danish national pavilion for the world expo in two thousand and ten and we saw this guy the mascot of the expo and he looks strangely familiar in fact he looked like a building we had designed for a hotel in the north of sweden when we submitted it for the swedish competition we thought it was a really cool scheme but it didn't exactly look like something from the north of sweden the swedish jury didn't think so so we lost but then we had a meeting with a chinese businessman who saw our design and said wow that's the chinese character for the word people so apparently this is how you write people as in the people 's republic of china we even double checked and at the same time we got invited to exhibit at the shanghai creative industry week so recently we asked ourselves if we could invent a format that could actually tell the stories behind the projects maybe combining images and drawings and words to actually sort of so the people 's building as we called it this is our two interpreters sort of reading the architecture it went on the cover of the wen wei po newspaper which got mister liang yu chen the mayor of shanghai to visit the exhibition and we had the chance to explain the project and he said shanghai is the city in the world with most skyscrapers but to him it was as if the connection to the roots had been cut over but like i said haibao looked very familiar because he is actually the chinese character for people and they chose this mascot because the theme of the expo is better city better life sustainability and we thought like sustainability has grown into being this sort of neo protestant idea that is has to hurt in order to do good you know you're not supposed to take long warm showers you're not supposed to fly on holidays because it's bad for the environment you get this idea that sustainable life is less fun than normal life so we thought that maybe it could be interesting to focus on examples where a sustainable city actually increases the quality of life china has many great poets but we discovered that in the people 's republic public school curriculum they have three fairy tales by an tu shung or hans christian anderson as we call him tell stories about architecture and we discovered that we didn't have to invent it it already existed in the form of a comic book so that means that all one point three billion chinese have grown up with the emperor 's new clothes the matchstick girl and the little mermaid it's almost like a fragment of danish culture integrated into chinese culture and it sort of shows the difference between these two cities copenhagen shanghai modern european but then we looked at recent urban development and we noticed that this is like a shanghai street thirty years ago all bikes no cars this is how it looks today all traffic jam bicycles have become forbidden many places we donate one thousand bikes to shanghai so if you come to the expo go straight to the danish pavillion get a danish bike and then continue on that to visit the other pavillions so we thought that these expos quite often have a lot of state financed propaganda images statements but no real experience so just like with a bike we don't talk about it you can try it like with the so we basically copied the format of the comic book so actually we tell the stories of behind the scenes how our projects actually evolve through adaptation and improvisation this is where people normally object that it doesn't sound very sustainable to sail water from copenhagen to china but in fact the container ships go full of good from china to denmark and then they sail empty back so quite often you load water for ballast so we can actually hitch a ride for free and in the middle of this sort of harbor bath we're actually going to put the actual little mermaid so the real mermaid the real water and the real bikes and when she's gone we're going to invite a chinese artist to reinterpret her the architecture of the pavilion is this sort of loop of exhibition and when you go to the exhibition you'll see the mermaid and the pool you'll walk around start looking for a bicycle on the roof jump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo so when we actually won the competition we had to do an exhibition in china explaining the project and to our surprise we got one of our boards back with corrections from the chinese state censorship so when it came out in denmark that we were actually going to move our national monument the national people 's party sort of the turmoil and the opportunities and the incidents of the real world we call this comic book yes is more rebelled against it they tried to pass a law against moving the mermaid so for the first time i got invited to speak at the national parliament in the morning from nine to eleven they were discussing the bailout package how many billions to invest in saving the danish economy but to conclude if you want to see the mermaid from may to december next year don't come to copenhagen because she's going to be in shanghai if you do come to copenhagen you will probably see an installation by ai weiwei the chinese artist but if the chinese government intervenes it might even be a panda so the second story that i'd like to tell is actually starts in my own house this is my apartment this is the view from my apartment over the sort of landscape of triangular balconies that our client called the leonardo dicaprio balcony and they form this sort of vertical backyard where on a nice summer day you'll actually get introduced to all your neighbors in a vertical radius of ten meters which is obviously a sort of evolution of the ideas of some of our heroes in this case it's mies van der rohe 's less is more he triggered the modernist revolution the house is sort of a distortion of a square block trying to zig zag it to make sure that all of the apartments look at the straight views instead of into each other because copenhagen is completely flat if you want to have a nice south facing slope with a view you basically have to do it yourself then we sort of cut up the volume so we wouldn't block the view from my apartment and essentially the parking is sort of occupying the deep space underneath the apartments and up in the sun you have like a single layer of apartments all the splendors of a suburban lifestyle like a house with a garden with a sort of metropolitan view and a sort of dense urban location this is our first architectural model this is an aerial photo taken last summer and essentially the apartments cover the parking they are accessed through this diagonal and after him followed the post modern counter revolution robert venturi saying less is a bore after him philip johnson sort of introduced the facade of the parking we wanted to make the parking naturally ventilated so we needed to perforate it and we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes we could actually turn the entire facade into a gigantic naturally ventilated rasterized image so if you go back into the parking into the corridors it's almost like traveling into a parallel universe from into this sort of south facing urban oasis the wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades if you go even further it turns into and all the rainwater that drops on the mountain is actually accumulated and there is an automatic irrigation system so the mountain is like our first built example of what we like to refer to as architectural alchemy this idea that you can actually create if not gold then at least added value by mixing traditional ingredients like normal apartments and normal parking and in this case actually offer people the chance that they don't have to choose between a life with a garden or a life in the city they can actually have both as an architect it's really hard to set the agenda you can't just say that now i'd like to do a sustainable city in central asia because that's not really how you get commissions you always have to sort of adapt and improvise to the opportunities and accidents that happen and the sort of turmoil of the world one last example is that recently we like last summer we won the competition to design a nordic national bank this was the director of the bank when he was still smiling it was in the middle of the capital so we were really excited by this opportunity unfortunately it was the national bank of iceland at the same time we actually had a visitor a minister from azerbaijan came to our office we took him to see the mountain and he got very excited by this idea that you could actually make mountains out of architecture because azerbaijan is known as the alps of central asia so he asked us if we could actually imagine an urban master plan on an island outside the capital that would recreate the silhouette of the seven most significant mountains of azerbaijan so we took the commission and we made this small movie that i'd like to show we quite often make little movies we always argue a lot about the soundtrack but in this case it was really easy to choose the song so basically baku is this sort of crescent bay overlooking the island of zira the island that we are planning almost like the diagram of their flag our main idea was to sort of sample the seven most significant mountains of the topography of azerbaijan and reinterpret them into urban and architectural structures inhabitable of human life and what we'd like to say with yes is more is basically trying to question this idea that the architectural avant garde is almost always negatively defined as who or what we are against it has no vegetation it has no water it has no energy no resources so we actually sort of designed the entire island as a single ecosystem exploiting wind energy to drive the desalination plants and to use the thermal properties of water to heat and cool the buildings and all the sort of excess freshwater wastewater is filtered organically into the landscape gradually transforming the desert island into sort of a green lush landscape so you can say where an urban development normally happens at the expense of nature in this case it's actually creating nature,1,"public debate about I've taken a quite often just to stays on contemplating their the final result of the architectural object of the show The Affair is the latest Tower in London sausage 62. so a reason to be asked ourselves if we could actually still have invented a format that could actually tell the stories behind the project may be combining images and drawings and words to actually should have tell stories about architecture and we discovered that we didn't have to invented it already existed in the form of a comic book so we basically copy of the form of comic books Tri-City tell the stories of behind-the-scenes how a project actually evolved through meditation and improvisation so them to the turmoil and the opportunities and the incidence of the real world record this comic-book yes has more which is obviously a sort of evolution of the ideas of some of our heroes in this case it's small he triggered the modernist Revolution after him fall of the postmodern counter-revolution Robert Venturi saying this is a ball after him Philip Johnson should have introduced. you can say promiscuity or this openness to new ideas when I'm a hoe recently Obama has introduced optimism is a time of global financial crisis and what is busy trying to question this idea that there is almost always negative defined as who or what we are against the cliche of the radical man rebelling against the establishment of the Misunderstood genius frustrated that the world doesn't fit in with his or her ideas. rather than Revolution be much more interested in evolution this idea that things gradually evolved by at that thing and improvising to the the changes of the world in fact I should think that is a one of the people who best explains our design process this famous evolutionary tree could almost be a diagram of the way we work as you can see a project involves through a series of generations of design meetings at each meeting there's way too many ideas only the best ones can survive and through a process of selection we might choose a really beautiful model have a very functional model be made to them they have some mutants Offspring and through the generations of design design a very little way of showing at the Marriott Hotel in Copenhagen. the design process was like almost like a struggle for survival and evolved that melts together with the surrounding CD expanding the public space on to what we refer to as a Scandinavian version of the Spanish Steps in Rome but some of public on the outside as well as on the inside with the library. put the only explain evolution of a single idea as you can see sometimes a subspecies branches off and final meeting and we work in this context but for another client in another culture you could be be the right answer to a to a different question so as a result we never throw anything out we keep our office almost like an archive of architecture of biodiversity you never know when you might need it and what I'd like to do now and have warp speed storytelling is it tell me the story of how to project fi adapting and improvising to to the happenstance of the world. the first story starts last year when we went to Shanghai to do the competition for the Danish national division for the World Expo in 2010 and we saw this guy how is the mascot of the ex and you look strangely familiar infection looks like a building we have to sign for a hotel in the North of Sweden when we submitted it for the Swedish conversation and we thought it was really cool but it didn't exactly look like something from the North of Sweden the sweetest jury didn't think so either so we lost but then we had a meeting with a Chinese businessman who saw a haircut for the word people and at the same time my treat of interesting week too much of an opportunity so we hide it from shui Master we scale the building up three times.so the People's Building as we called it this is how to interpret us about reading the agitation and went on the cover of the rebound newspaper which got mr. Lang you change the mayor of Shanghai to visit if you have a chance to explain the project and he said Shanghai is the city in the world with most of us are over and we the Peeples building he's the one I can think of that could bridge the gap between the ancient wisdom of China and the progressive future of China agree with him. unfortunately miss the chain is now in prison for corruption. but like I said I found a very familiar because she is actually the Chinese character for people and the end they chose this mask on because the theme of the the Expo is better Siri better life new Protestant idea that you know it has to hurt in order to do good you know you're not supposed to take long showers and you know you're not supposed to fly on holidays cuz it's bad for the environment of life is less fun than normal life so we thought that maybe could be interesting to focus and examples where is the state of the city actually increases the quality of life that would be relevant you know it's one of the biggest countries in the world one of the smallest China symbolized by the dragon and then might we have a national bird the swan. China has too many great poets but we discovered that in the People's Republic Public School curriculum they have three fairy tales by and tissue or Hands Christian Andersen as we call him so that means he's an old 1.3 billion Chinese have grown up with the emperor's new clothes that match the drill and the Little Mermaid it's almost like a fragment of Danish cause integrated into Chinese culture the biggest tourist attraction in China as the Great War the Great War from the Moon is a little mermaid that actually hot. and it shows the difference between the two cities Copenhagen Shanghai modern European but they're decent Urban Development and we noticed that this is like a Shanghai Street 30 years ago or bikes know cos this is how you look today all traffic jam bicycles have become forbidden many places meanwhile in Copenhagen we had a free system of bicycles cost the City by that you can borrow if you visit the sea so we don't like why don't we reintroduce the bicycle in China we donate a thousand bikes to Shanghai so if you come to the Expo go straight to the dance Pavilion get a Danish bike and then continue on that service of the other provisions. like I said Shanghai in Copenhagen affair with Portuguese but in Copenhagen Devore has gotten so clean that you can swim in it one of the first project we ever did was to have a bath and Copenhagen continuing the public realm into the water expose fight off and have like a lot of state finance propaganda images statements but no real experience so just like with the bike if we don't talk about it you can try it like with the bottom it says talking about going to steal a million litres of Harbor water from Copenhagen to Shanghai so the Chinese records can actually driving and you happiness this is why people only object that it doesn't sound very sustainable to say of water from coming through to China but in fact the couch they like the container ships Go full of goods from China to Denmark and then they seal M&T Bank so quite often you load board of a ballast so we can actually hitch a ride for free and in the middle of this would have happened if we are going to put the actual Little Mermaid so the real murderer. if you Laura in the real bikes and when she's gone we're going to invite a Chinese artist to reinterpret the architecture of the loop of exhibition and Ikes when you go to the exhibition to see the mermaid in the walk around start looking for bicycle on the roof jump on your right and then continue out into the rest of the Expo. so when we actually 12 competition we had to do an exhibition in China explaining the project and to our surprise we got one of our boats back with corrections from the Chinese State censorship the first thing the China map Miss Taiwan it's very serious political issue in China we will add on the second thing we have compared the swan to the dragon and then the Chinese States it suggests change to Panda. so why when it came out in Denmark that we were going to move our national monument the national People's Party should have rebelled against they try to pass a law against moving the mermaid show for the first time I got invited to speak at the national Parliament is not interesting because like in the morning from 9 to 11 they were discussing the bailout package, how many billions to investment savings day in Chicana me and then at 11 they stopped talkin about these little issues and then from 11 to 1 they were debating whether or not to send the mermaid to China. to conclude if you want to see the mermaid from May to December next year don't come to Copenhagen cuz she's going to be in Shanghai installation by Highway the Chinese artist but if the Chinese government intervenes it might even be a panda. so the second story that I had that I like to chill it's actually starts in my own house this is my apartment. this is the view from my Apartments over there should have landscape of triangular balconies that our client called the Leonardo DiCaprio balcony and they form the vertical backyard we're on a nice summer day you'll actually get introduced to all your neighbors and it varies with radius of 10 minutes the house is a distortion of a square block trying to get all the apartments look at the street views instead of into each other for my apartment on to this place where the neighbor site and he said that he was going to do an apartment block next to the parking structure and we don't like bother doing like a traditional stack of Apartments looking straight into a big boring block of cars why don't you ask you turn all the apartments in to Pint House put them on the podium of cos if you just told Megan is completely flat if you want have a nice south-facing slope with a view you basically have to do it yourself maybe you should have cut up the volume so we wouldn't. block the view from my apartment. and essentially the parking is said of the occupying the deep space underneath the apartments and Ava in the sun you have like a single layer of apartments that combines with all the splendors of a Suburban lifestyle like a house with a garden with a submission policy review and a set of dense Urban location. so this is our first actual model this is an aerial photo taken last summer and it's the apartments cover the packing their access to this diagonal elevator it's actually a standard product from Switzerland to ski in Switzerland they have a natural need for diagonal elevators. Emma and the facade of the parking we wanted to make the packing naturally ventilated so we needed to perforated and we discovered that by controlling the size of the hose because I actually turned the entire facade in gigantic naturally ventilated restaurant image as we always refer to the project as the mountain we commissioned to Stephanie's Himalaya photographer to give us this beautiful photo of Mount Everest making the entire building a 3000 square meter at work. so you go back into the parking into the corridors it's almost like traveling into a parallel universe from cars and colors into this to the south-facing Urban Oasis the root of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades if you go even further it's what turns into the green garden and all the rainwater that drops on the mountain is actually accumulated and there's an automatic irrigation system but make sure was that they should have landscape of Gardens and one or two years with transform into server Cambodian Temple Ruin completely covered in Korean. so the mountain is like our first field example of what we like to refer to as a potential Alchemy this idea that you can actually create if not goals and added value by mixing traditional ingredients like normal apartments in a normal parking and in this case off of people that are the chance that they don't have to choose between a life with a garden or life in the city that can actually have both. as an architect it's really hot to set the agenda you can't just say that now I'd like to do a sustainable City in Central Asia because that's not really how you get the commission's you always have to sort of adept and improvised to to the opportunities an accident that happened in the turmoil of the world one last stop this is recently we want we want the competition to design a nortek National Bank this was the director of the bank when he was still smiling. he was in the middle of the excited by this opportunity unfortunately it was the National Bank of Iceland at the same time from Azerbaijan came to our office we took him to see the mountain and he got very excited and make mountains out of Architecture is known as the Alps of Central Asia so we asked us if we could actually imagine an urban master plan on an island outside the capital that would recreate the silhouette of the seven most significant mountains of Azerbaijan so we took that the commission and he made this small movie that I'd like to show me quite often make the movies and we always argue a lot about the soundtrack but in this case it was really easy to to choose their the song. so bracelet back who is this with Crescent Bay overlooking the island of zero of the island that we are planning almost like a diagram of their flag. and homemade I think it was just a sample of the seven most significant mountains of the Topography of Azerbaijan and reinterpret them into urban and Architectural structures inhabited place these mountains on the Island surrounding the sort of central Green Valley almost like a psychopath. and what makes it interesting is that the Island right now it's just a piece of desert has no vegetation has no water and has no energy so we actually extorting wind energy to drive the desalination plants and could use the thermal properties of water to heat and cool the buildings and all this Earth exist fresh water or waste water is filtered organically into the landscape gradually transforming the desert island intercept of a green Lush landscape so you can say we're in Urban Development normally happens at the expense of the nature in this case is actually creating nature and the and the buildings they don't only invoke the imagery of the mountains they also operate the dike in mountains they secrete Shelter From the winds they accumulate the solar energy they actually the water so they could transform the entire Island into. ecosystem. so what's going to be the first cop on neutral Island in in Central Asian.round off so anyway you can you can see how that the mountain in Copenhagen sort of evolved into the second piece of Azerbaijan and with a little luck and some more Evolution maybe in ten years it could be that the five mountains of unmask thank you",0.7174479365348816,
63,BjornLomborg_2005.sph.wav,the obvious question would be to ask what do you think are the biggest things where should we start on solving these problems but that's a wrong problem to ask that was actually the problem in davos in january but of course there's a problem in asking people to focus on problems because what i'd like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world i'm not going to talk about the skeptical environmentalist probably that's also a good choice to communicable diseases it might be health clinics or mosquito nets to conflicts it would be u n s peacekeeping forces and so on the point that i would like to ask you to try to do is just in thirty seconds and i know this is in a sense an impossible task write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities and also and that 's of course where economics gets evil to put down what are the things we should not do first what should be at the bottom of the list please just take thirty seconds perhaps talk to your neighbor and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the world 's biggest issues the amazing part of this process and of course i mean i would love to i only have eighteen minutes i've already given you quite a substantial amount of my these discussions afterwards to think about how do we actually prioritize of course you have to ask yourself why on earth was such a list never done before and one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable but i am going talk about what are the big problems in the world and i must say before i go on i should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because i'm actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that so get out your pen and paper spots on the list than there is number ones it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list we've had the u n for almost sixty years yet we've never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world and said which of them should we do first so it doesn't mean that we are not prioritizing any decision is a prioritization so of course we are still prioritizing if only implicitly and that's unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization and went in and talked about so what i'm proposing is really to say that we have for a very long time had a situation when we've had a menu of choices there are many many things we can do out there not had the prices nor the sizes we have not had an idea imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card but you have no idea what the price is you know you have a pizza you've no idea what the price is it could be at one dollar it could be one thousand dollars it could be a family size pizza it could be a very individual size pizza right we'd like to know these things and that is what the copenhagen consensus is really trying to do to try to put prices on these issues and so basically this has been the copenhagen consensus process we got thirty of the world 's best economists three in each area so we have three of world 's top economists write about climate change what can we do what will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that likewise in communicable diseases three of the world 's top experts saying what can we do what would be the price what should we do about it and what will be the outcome and so on then we had some of the world 's top economists of the world 's top economists including three nobel laureates meet in copenhagen in may two thousand and four we called them the dream team the cambridge university call them the real madrid of economics that works very well in europe but it doesn't really work over here and what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list and then you ask why economists and of course i'm very happy you asked that question because that's a very good question the point is of course if you want to know about malaria you ask a malaria expert if you want to know about climate you ask a climatologist but if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first you can't ask either of them because that's not what they do that is what economists do they prioritize they make that bottom line is there is a lot of problems out there in the world i'm just going to list some of them there are eight hundred million people starving there's a billion people without clean drinking water in some ways disgusting task of saying which one should we do first and which one should we do afterwards so this is the list and this is the one i'd like to share with you of course you can also see it on the website and we'll also talk about it more i'm sure as the day goes on they basically came up with a list where they said there were projects where if you invest a dollar you get less than a dollar back then there's fair projects good projects and very good projects and of course it's the very good projects we should start doing i'm going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best as you might see the bottom of the list was climate change this offends a lot of people and that's probably one of the things where people will say i shouldn 't come back reason why they came up with saying that kyoto or doing something more than kyoto is a bad deal is simply because it's very inefficient it's not saying that global warming is not happening it's not saying that it's not a big problem but it's saying that what we can do about it is very little at a very high cost what they basically show us the average of all macroeconomic models is that kyoto if everyone agreed would cost about one hundred and fifty billion dollars a year that's a substantial amount of money that's two to three times the global development aid that we give the third world every year yet it would do very little good all models show it will postpone warming so the idea here really is to say well we've spent a lot of money doing a little good and just to give you a sense of reference the u n actually estimate that for half that amount for about seventy five billion dollars a year we could solve all major basic problems in the world we could give clean drinking water sanitation basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet so we have to ask ourselves do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of and that is really why it becomes a bad project it's not to say that if we had all the money in the world we wouldn't want to do it but it's to say when we don it's just simply not our first priority the fair projects notice i'm not going to comment on all these but communicable diseases scale of basic health services just made it simply because yes scale of basic health services is a great thing it would do a lot of but it's also very very costly again what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation if you look at the good projects a lot of sanitation and water projects came in again sanitation and water is incredibly important but it also costs a lot of infrastructure so i'd like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world the fourth best problem is malaria dealing with malaria the incidence of malaria is about a couple of people get infected every year it might even cost up towards percentage point of gdp every year for affected nations if we invested about thirteen billion dollars over the next four years we could bring that incidence down to half change so on there are many many problems out there in an ideal world we would solve we would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with of course in the long run also to deal with global warming third best one was free trade basically the model showed that if we could get free trade and especially cut subsidies in the u s and europe we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about two thousand four hundred billion dollars a year half of which would accrue to the third world again the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty there's a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition namely the lack of micronutrients basically about half of the world 's population is lacking in iron zinc iodine and vitamin a if we invest about twelve billion dollars we could make a severe inroad into that problem that would be the second best investment that we could do and the very best project would be but we don 't we don't actually solve all problems and if we do not the question i think we need to ask ourselves and that's why it's on the economy session to focus on hiv aids basically if we invest twenty seven billion dollars over the next eight years we could avoid twenty eight new million cases of hiv aids again what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with hiv aids one is treatment the other one is and again in an ideal world we would do both but in a world where we don't do either or don't do it very well we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first and treatment is much much more expensive than prevention so basically what this focuses on is saying we can do a lot more by investing in prevention basically for the amount of money that we spend we can do x amount of good in treatment and ten times as much good in prevention so again what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment at first rate what this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities have you look at your priority list and say did you get it right or did you get close to what we came up with well of course one of the things is climate change again i find a lot of people find it very very unlikely that we should do that we should also do climate change if for no other reason simply because it's such a big problem but of course we don't do all problems there are many problems out there in the world and what i want to make if we actually focus on problems that we focus on the right ones the ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good and i think actually thomas schelling one of the participants in the dream team he put it very very well one of things that people forget is that in one hundred years when we're talking about most of the climate change impacts will be people will be much much richer even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the u n estimate that the average person in the developing world one hundred will be about as rich as we are today much more likely they will be two to four times richer than we are and of course we'll be even richer than that but the point is to say when we talk about saving people or helping people in bangladesh in two thousand one hundred we're not talking about a poor bangladeshi we're actually talking about a fairly rich dutch guy and so the real point of course is to say do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little one hundred years from now a fairly rich dutch guy or do we want to help real poor people right now in bangladesh who really need the help and whom we can help very very cheaply or as schelling put it imagine if you were will be a rich chinese a rich bolivian a rich congolese in two thousand one hundred thinking back on two thousand and five and saying how that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather they could have helped so much more and who needed the help so much more so i think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight even if it doesn't accord to the typical way we see this problem of course that's mainly because climate change has such good pictures we have you know the day after tomorrow it looks great right it's a good film in the sense that i certainly want to see it right but don't expect emmerich to cast brad pitt in his next movie digging latrines in tanzania or something it just doesn't make for as much of a movie so in many ways i think of the copenhagen consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems to spend to do good in this world where should we spend it we identified ten of the biggest challenges in the world to make sure that we realize it's not about making us feel good it's not about making things that have the most media attention but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good the other objections i think that are important to say is that i'm somehow or we are somehow positing a false choice of course we should do all things in an ideal world i would certainly agree likewise people are also saying but what about the iraq war you know we spend one hundred billion dollars why don't we spend that on doing good in the world i'm all for that if any one of you guys can talk bush into doing that that's fine but the point of course is still to say if you get another one hundred billion dollars so the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities i should just mention briefly is this really the right list that we got out just briefly read them climate change communicable diseases conflicts education financial instability governance and corruption malnutrition and hunger you know when you ask the world 's best economists you inevitably end up asking old white american men and they're not necessarily ways of looking at the entire world so we actually invited eighty young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem the only two requirements were that they were studying at the university and they spoke english the majority of them were first from developing countries they had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion and they certainly did to come up with their own lists and the surprising thing was that the list was very similar with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom we've done this many other times there's been many other seminars and university students and different things they all come out with very much the same list and that gives me great hope really in saying that i do believe that there is a to get us to start thinking about priorities and saying what is the important thing in the world of course in an ideal world again we'd love to do everything but if we don't do it then we can start thinking about where should we start i see the copenhagen consensus as a process we did it in two thousand and four and we hope to assemble many more people getting much better information for two thousand and eight two thousand and twelve map out the right path for the world but also to start thinking about political at the end of the day you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these but we have to be honest and frank about saying if there's some things we do,1,"what I like to talk about is really am the biggest problems in the world I'm not going to talk about the skeptical environmentalist probably that's also a good choice but I am going to talk before I go on I just asked everyone of you try to get up a pen and paper because I'm actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that's okay I got your pen and paper bottom line is there is a lot of problems there in the world I'm just going to let some of them their 800 million people starving does a billion people about clean Drinking Water 2 million people without sanitation there several million people dying of HIV and the list goes on and on there's two billions of people who'll be severely affected by climate change so why do many many problems out there in an Ideal World we would solve them all but we don't we don't actually solve all problem and if we do not the question I think we need to ask ourselves and that's why it's on the economy session is to say if we don't do all things we really have to start asking us. which ones should we saw first and that's the question I'd like to ask you if we have say 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world where should we spend it we identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world now just briefly read them climate change committee Boosie's is conflicts education Financial instability governance and Corruption malnutrition and hunger population migration sanitation water and subsidies in on Trade Fair is we believe the decent many ways and Compass the biggest problems in the world the obvious question would be tasks. what do you think of the biggest things where should we start on solving these problems but that's a wrong problems and problems because we can't solve problems really the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die but we don't have the technology to solve. Write so the point is not to prior to the problems the point is to prioritize solutions to problems and that would be a little more complicated to climate change help you like Kyoto to give me the full seasons of might be health clinics on mosquito Nets to the UN peacekeeping forces and so on the point that I would like to ask you to try to do this just in 30 seconds I know this impossible task you think it's probably some of the top priorities and also and that's of course we're economics gets able to put down what are the things we should not do first what should be at the bottom of the list please. to your neighbor and just figure out what should be the top priorities in the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have the world's biggest issue the amazing part of this process and of course I mean I would love to I only have 18 minutes, I've already given you a quite a substantial amount of my time right I love to go into about this process to think about how do we actually never done before and nobody wants to do this type of course every organization would love to be in the top of socialist but every organization that makes perfect sense not to want to do such almost sixty Years yet we've never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world. which of them should we do first so it doesn't mean that we are not good as if we actually did the privatization and went in and talked about it what I'm proposing is really to say that we have for a very long time had a situation where we had a menu of choices the many many things we can do out there but we not have the prices nor The Sciences we have not had an idea matches going into restaurant and getting this big menu car but you have no idea what the prices you know you have a pizza you've no idea what the prices they could be a family-size pizza it could be a very individual size pizza would like to know these things and that is what the prices on these issues and so basically right about climate change. what will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that likewise what can we do and so warm then we had some of the world's top Economist of the world's top Economist including three Noble Lawrence meet in Copenhagen in May 2004 we called them the Dream Team the Cambridge University press has decided to call them the Real Madrid of Economics that works very well and it doesn't really work over here and then you ask why condiments and of course I'm very happy you asked that question because that's a very good question if you want to know about malaria malaria British you want to know which of the two you should deal with first you can't ask either of them because that's not what they do that is what it kind of threw. and in some ways disgusting task which one should we do first thing which one should we do afterwards so this is the list and this is the one I'd like to share with you and website and I'm sure most of the days goes on they basically came up with a list where they said they were bat project at all aback when there's good and very good pocket it's a very good project we should start doing I'm going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best project project. as you might see the bottom of the list with climate change. This happens a lot of people and that's probably one of the things what people will say I shouldn't come back either why is it came up and I'll actually have to try to get back to this because it's probably one of the things that will disagree with on the list that you wrote down the reason why they came up with saying the Kyoto or doing something more than what is a patio what we can do about it is very little at a very high cost. what they basically show us what's the average mold macroeconomic model killed at everyone agreed to you spell development of the week of the third world every year on 106 75 billion dollars a year we could solve all major basic problems in the world we could get clean Drinking Water Sanitation basic health care and education to every single human being on the planet so we have to ask ourselves if we want to spend twice the amount and doing very little good but half the amount I'm doing an amazing amount of good and that is really white comes in if we had all the money. we wouldn't want to do it but it's to say when we don't it's just a wee not our first priority the fair projects notice I'm not going to come in and all these basic health services just made it simply because yeah Skillet basic health services a great thing to do a lot of a lot of Sanitation water projects came in again as incredibly important but it also cost a lot of infrastructure so I'd like to show you the top four parties that we deal with when we talked about how we should deal with the problems in the world problem is malaria dealing with malaria the incident caused up to a percentage point of GDP every year for effect with Nations if we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years we could bring that incidents down to half. five hundred thousand people think they're bility to deal with many of the other problems they have to be a long one also to deal with global warming was free trade basically model show that if we could get free trade and specially cut subsidies in the US and Europe we could basically enliven the global economy to a standing number about two thousand four hundred billion dollars a year half of which would accrue to the third world is to say that we can actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty very radically fast but two to five years that would be the third best thing we could do the second best thing would be the focus of malnutrition not just smelling fish in general but there's a very cheap way of dealing with the lack of micronutrients basically about half of the world's population is lacking vitamin A. if we can West about 12 billion dollars we could make it to be in the road into that problem that would be the second best investment that we could do and the very best project would be to focus on HIV AIDS basically if we invest 27 billion over the next eight years we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV AIDS the song they're two very different ways that we can deal with HIV 81 is treatment the other one is prevention and again in an Ideal World we would do both but in that world where we don't do either or don't do it very well we have to at least ask yourself where should we invest first and treatment is much more expensive then we can do a lot more by investing in prevention basically for the amount of money that we spend we can do x amount of good and treatment and ten times as much good and prevention so again what we focus on. rather than treatment of first-rate what this really does is that it makes us to think about our priorities I'd like to have you look at your priority list close to what we came up with you of course one of the things this is climate change again I find a lot of people find it very very unlikely that we should do that we should also do five and change if no other reason simply because it's such a big problem but if we don't do all problems them many problems out in their world and what I want to make sure of is if we actually focusing problems that we focus on the right ones the ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good and I think actually, Shelly and the Dream Team he put it very very well the people forget there's an hundred years when we're talking about most of the climate change impacts will be people who will be much much richer even the most pessimistic impacted areas of the UN estimates that the average. developing World in 2100 will be about as rich as we are today much more likely they will be two to four times richer than we are will be even richer than that but the point is to talk about saving people for helping people in Bangladesh in 2100 we're not talking about a poor Bangladeshi Philly rich guy and so the real point of course I want to spend a lot of money helping a little a hundred years from now really rich guy or do we want to help real poor people right now in Bangladesh really need the help and whom we can help you put it if you were a rich as you will be a rich Chinese or Rich Bolivian a rich Congo knees in 2100 thinking back in 2005 and saying how odd. but they kept so much about helping me a little bit for climate change and cats with very little about helping my grandfather and my great-grandfather when they could help so much more and who needed the help so much more I think that really does tell us why we need to get to the that's mainly because of climate change that has good pictures but don't expect emmerich Brad Pitt in the discussion of parties as a defense for boring problems to make sure that we realize it's not about making us feel good it's not about making things that has two most media. what is about making places where we can actually do the most good the other objections I think they're important to say is that I'm somehow or we are somehow in an Ideal World I'd certainly agree I think we should do all things but we don't and 1970 the developed World decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did right now and in 1970 on the developing world since then our Aid has hacked so it doesn't look like we're actually in the path of suddenly solving all big problems like white people also saying that we spend a hundred billion dollars at why don't we spend that I'm doing good in the world for that if any one of you guys can talk to oshun to do that that's fine but the point of course I don't want to spend that in the best possible way I don't we so the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities I should just mentioned briefly is this really the right list that we got out when you asked. world's best economies in the end up asking old white American men and they're not necessarily people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem the only two requirements was that they were studying at the University and they spoke English they had all the same material that they could go outside to come up with their own lessons surprising thing was that the list was very someone with malnutrition and disease is a top and climate change the bottom we've done this many of the times has been many of those seminars and University students and different things they all come out with pretty much the same list and that gives me great hope that I do believe that there is a path ahead to start thinking about priorities what is the important thing in the world. then we can start thinking about where should we start I see the Copenhagen consensus as a process we did in 2004 we hope to assemble many more people getting much better information for 2008-2012 map out the right path for the world but also to start thinking about political triage to start thinking about saying how to do but let's do the great thing is where we can do an enormous amount of good a very low-cost right now at the end of the day you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these but we have to be honest and Frank about saying if there's some things we do there are things we don't do if we worry too much about some things we end up on to worry about a thing so I hope this will help us make that our priorities and think about how we'd better work today thank you",0.7682291269302368,
64,BlaiseAguerayArcas_2010.sph.wav,but i'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff so we see the imagery of course not stopping sky these little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made i'm not going to dive into them either but photosynths and integrated into the map and so when you fly down thank you when you fly down to the ground and you see this kind of panoramic imagery the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture there's just as much three dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three dimensional city from above so if i click on something to get a closer view of it then the fact that that transition looks as it does is a function of all of that geometry all of that three d understanding behind this model now i'll show you a fun app that thank but what's cool about this is that not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with now i just made a transition indoors that's also interesting okay notice there's now a roof above us we're inside the pike place market and this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera so we're not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars but we're also imaging inside which is microsoft 's online mapping effort in the past two and a half we've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online and from here we're able to do the same sorts of registration not only of still images but also of video so this is something that we're now going to try for the first time live and this is really truly very frightening okay all right guys are you there all right there we go so these are our friends in pike place market the lab they're broadcasting this live okay george can you pan back over to the corner market because i want to show points of interest the other way yeah yeah back to the corner back to the corner i don't want to see you guys yet back to the corner back to the corner back to the and we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to we're doing two different things here one of them is to take that now and walk back outside and while i walk outside i'll just mention that here we're using this for telepresence but you can equally well use this on the spot for augmented reality when you use it on the spot it means that you're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you so here we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it that was being broadcast by the way on a four g network from the market all right and now there's one last ted talk that microsoft has given in the past several years and that's curtis wong worldwide telescope so we're going to head over to the dumpsters where it's traditional after a long day at the market to go out for a break but also stare up at the sky this is the integration of worldwide telescope time but if we scrub the time then we can see how the sky will look at different times and we can get all this very detailed information about different times different dates let 's move the moon a little higher in the sky maybe change the date i would like to kind of zoom in on the moon so this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the earth all right now i've run my time so i've got to stop thank you all very much mapping is of course not just about cartography it's also about imagery so as we zoom in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of sim city like we see this space this three dimensional environment as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out and map 's directions are really just one of them if you click on this you'll see some of the ones that we've put out just in the past couple of months since we've launched so for example a couple of days after the disaster in haiti we an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky this wonderful one which i don't have time to show you is taking hyper local blogs in real time and mapping those stories those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs it's wonderful,1,about a year-and-a-half ago Stephen of All or Nothing in the past two-and-a-half we've been very hard at work used to sew the first thing you might notice about the camping site is just the fluidity of the zooming in the pending which if you're feeling that's where it comes from of course not just about cartography it's also about imagery so as we zoom in the oldest this resolves into a kind of SimCity like virtual View at 45�� this can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city all the facades. we see this space this three-dimensional environment as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can I can play out on the maps directions are really just one of them if you click on this you'll see some of the ones that we've put out just in the past couple of months so for example a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti we had before and after pictures from the sky this wonderful one which I don't have time to show you is picking up a little logs in real time and mapping those stories those entries at the place was their referred to On the Block cuz it's it's so that's wonderful but I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff so I don't know. will we see the imagery of course not stopping at the sky gives little green bubbles represents photosynthesis that users have made integrated into the map everything that's case then blew it is an area where we taken imagery on the ground as well when you fly down to the ground and you see this this kind of panoramic imagery in the first thing that might notice is that it's not just it's not just the picture there's just as much Freedom as for understanding of this environment as there is of of the three-dimensional City from above so if I click on something to get a closer view of it then the fact that the transition looks as it does is a function of all of that is pretty understanding behind this model I'll show you what a fun app. we've we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at flicker this takes flicker registered imagery and processes to connect that imagery I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to say pull up ft. but notice some. this is of course a popular tourist I know lots of photos around here and these photos were all taken at different times so this one was taken around 5 so that's the flipper photo that's that's how you really see how how this going to crowdsource imagery is integrating them very deep into the map itself. There's several reasons why this is why does interesting and one of them of course is time travel and I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historical imagery and if there's some with horses and carriages and so on as well but what's what's cool about this is a visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users but more than just a moment I just made a transition indoors that's also interesting is now a roof above us we're inside the Pike Place Market. so we're not holding not only Imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars but we're also Imaging inside from here the same sorts of registration not only of still images but also of video so this is something that we're not going to try for the first time I live and it's this is truly very frightening. okay. all right time. I'm closing play I love all right there we go so her friends in Pike Place Market. thank you. Anthem points of interest. cycling is the way if you're actually on the spot you can you can think about this this is. we're good we're doing we're doing two different we're doing two different things. different things here one of them one of them is to is to take that that real. let me just take a moment to thank the same as the other. all right I'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside and while it while I walk outside I'll just mention that were using this for telepresence but you can use this on the spot but the reality when you use it on the spot it means that you're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you from from the market I'm serious words finished little after a long day at the market so go out for a break and also stare up at the sky this isn't the worldwide telescope for maps. this is what the current state of this is the current time if we scrub the time that we can see how how the sky will look at different times and I can get all this very detailed information about different different times different dates let's let's move to the Moon a little higher in the sky maybe change though. change the date I would like to come to zoom in on the moon. so on this is this is astronomically complete representation of the of the sky integrated right into the right on. Thank you very much. my name is David hot minute to talk about the places presentation on that new mapping system I believe it mapping I mean I switched from iPhone to Android because of nothing is so powerfully idea what you could do one before so I thought what he said and what he left enough so so thank you. yesterday I had some questions about people's privacy because it's the first time that you can really see the detail level is so incredible amazing very very very impressive technology cannot wait to start using it I'd love to match my whole life everywhere yesterday Blaze showed us how we can have the world in our hands. a map to anywhere but not just a static map cuz the world why is a dynamic map where I can have video of my friends in another place to propose the map that I'm looking at all my God this was so exciting this notion of the world in the palm of my hand not in the walls in my house to call my hand whenever I need it live video. that's what that's about Big Ideas like that,0.7135416269302368,
65,BobThurman_2006S.sph.wav,the wonder of the universe everyone looked in that and they saw in there the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes and of course in the buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets with human life on and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets so they don 't when they look out and they see those lights that you showed in the sky they don't just see sort of pieces of matter burning or rocks or flames or gases exploding they actually see landscapes and human beings and i know his other name told us about interconnection and about how we're all totally interconnected here and how we've all known each other and of course in the buddhist universe we've already done this already billions of times in many many lifetimes in the past and i didn't give the talk always you did and we had to watch you and so forth and we're all still trying to i guess we're all trying to become tedsters if that's a modern form of enlightenment i guess because in a way if a tedster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything it's the forging of a mass awareness of where everybody can really know everything that's going on everywhere in the planet and therefore it will become intolerable what compassion is is where it will become intolerable for us totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying the life of the mind or whatever it is and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease and they cannot have a bite of food and they and i feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me i feel it's sort of like the vimalakirti sutra an ancient work from ancient india in which the buddha appears have no place or they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth it just becomes intolerable with all of us knowing everything we're kind of forced by and of course we all will be deeply disappointed when we do we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do a little bit tired we do suffer we do enjoy our misery in a certain way we distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere but basically we all have this common misery that stuck inside our skins and everyone else is out there and occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin and the two of us enjoy each other and each of us tried to get out of our own and ultimately it fails of course and we're back into this thing because our egocentric perception from the buddha 's point of view misperception is that all we are is what is inside our skin and it's inside and outside self and other and other is all very different and everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception a little bit who 's that and so you wouldn't sit that close to another person because of your notion that it's you versus the universe that's all buddha discovered because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone each of us and everyone else is different then that puts us in an impossible situation doesn't it who is it who 's going to get enough attention from the world who 's going to get enough out of the world who 's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings if you're different from all the other beings so where compassion comes is where you surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way through art through meditation through understanding through knowledge actually knowing that you have no such boundary knowing your interconnectedness with other beings you can experience yourself as the other beings when you see through the delusion of being separated from them at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area when you do that you're forced to feel what they feel luckily they say i still am not sure but luckily they say that when you reach that point because some people have said in the buddhist literature they say ooh who would really want to be compassionate how awful i'm so miserable on my own my head is aching my bones are aching i go from birth to death i'm never satisfied i never have enough even i'm a billionaire i never have enough i need a hundred billion so i'm like that imagine if i had to feel even a hundred other people 's suffering it would be terrible but apparently this is a strange paradox of life when you're no longer locked in yourself and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge of the nature of the world that enables you to let your mind spread out and empathize and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing and realizing that you are the other being somehow by that opening you can see the deeper nature of life and to bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make offering to song that song a perfect teaching but when we're relieved from that we somehow then become interested in all the other beings and we feel ourselves differently it's totally when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion it's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures are finally too small a theater for your intelligence it's really the young people actually from the city the old fogeys don't come because they're mad at buddha because when he came to their city he accepted he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him from whoever it is like this or like that or what you know and the more you focus on how you feel by the way the worse it gets like even when you're having a good time when is the good time over the good time is over when you think how good is it and then it's never good enough i love that said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time doing it by having a good time i think the dalai lama should have heard that i wish he'd been there to hear that he once told me he looked kind of sad he worries very much about the haves and have nots he said well a hundred years ago they went and took everything away from the haves you know the big communist revolutions russia and china and so forth they took it all away by violence saying they were going to give it to everyone and then they were even worse they didn't help at all so what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today and so then he looks at me so i said well you know you're all in this yourself you teach it's generosity was all i could think of what is virtue but of course i think the key to saving the world the key to compassion is that it is more it should be done by fun generosity is more fun that's the key everybody has the wrong idea they think buddha was so boring and they're so surprised when they meet dalai lama and he 's fairly jolly even though his people are being genocided and believe me he feels every blow on every old nun 's head in every chinese prison he feels it he feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays i won 't even say what they do but he feels it and yet he 's very jolly he 's extremely jolly because when you open up like that then you can't just what good does it do to add being miserable with others misery you have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is how it can be changed look at that beautiful thing chiho showed us she scared us with the lava man she scared us with the lava man is coming the tsunami is coming but then finally there was flowers and trees and it was very beautiful it's really lovely so compassion means to feel the feelings of others and the human being actually is compassion the human being is almost out of time the human being is compassion because what is our brain for jim 's brain is memorizing the almanac but he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is he will he did he could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings and he would have tremendous fun doing that so the first person who gets happy when you stop focusing on the self centered situation of how happy am i where you're always dissatisfied as mick jagger told us never get any satisfaction that way so then you decide well i'm sick of myself i'm going to think of how other people can be happy and the first person who gets happy when you do that you don't do anything for anybody else but you get happier you yourself because your whole perception broadens and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it and you realize that this being with these people is the flower garden that chiho showed us it is nirvana and my time is up and i know the ted commandments thank you and so they boycotted him they wouldn't go listen to him but the young people all came and they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol and they put it on the ground and as soon as they had laid all these all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient india he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium,1,San Jose. and I feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me I feel like it's sort of like the name of the curity Sutro. an injured worker from ancient India in which the blood appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area by shop. and they bring some sort of Jewel parasols to make an offering to him all the young people actually from the city the old fogies don't come because they're mad because when he came to their City he accepted he always accepts the first invitation that comes in from whoever it is and they local Geisha movie stars or the person who raced to the Elders of the city and The Chariot and invited him first so he was hanging out with the movie star and of course they were grumbling he's supposed to be religious and all this and what you doing over there at his house with only 500% are they were all grumbling they wouldn't listen to him but the young people came and they brought this kind of a parasol and they put it on the ground. and as soon as they've laid all these the old are big stack of these Jewels parasol that they used to carry an ancient India perform the kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium The Wonder of the universe everyone looked in that in this or any other total interconnectedness of all life in all universes and of course in the boot is Cosmos there are millions and billions of planets with human life on it and enlightened beings can see the life on other planets so they don't when they look out and they see the those lights that you showed in the sky they don't they don't just see some of the pieces of matter burning or rocks or Flames or gases exploding they actually see landscapes in human beings and gods and dragons and serpents beings and goddesses and things like that so he thought he made that special detective the beginning to get everyone to think about interconnection. and interconnected that said how everything is life was totally interconnected and then Lily Lily and how we roll totally interconnected here and how we've all known each other and important again in the Buddhist Universe we've already done this already billions of times in many many lifetimes in the past and I didn't give the talk always and she hold it and then Lily did and then it didn't end gym didn't you did we have to watch you until we're all still trying to get there as if that's if that's a modern form of enlightenment. I guess so because anyway is Ted's to relate to all this interconnectedness of all the computers and everything. it still is the forging of a of a mass awareness of where everybody could really know everything that's going on everywhere in the planet and therefore will it be will be coming talk with compassion is is where it will become intolerable for us totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying the life of the mind of the effort is and they are people who just absolutely are like real with this disease and they cannot have begun to buy them food and they have no place for their being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth it just becomes intolerable and then we all we're trying to force to buy technology to become Buddhist or something. and of course we all be deeply disappointed when we do. because we things we sort of things that because we are kind of tired of what we do little bit tired we we do suffer we we do enjoy our misery we distract ourselves from our Misery by running around somewhere but basically we all have this common misery that we're sort of stuck inside our skins and everyone else is out there and occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin of the two of us enjoy each other and each one tries to get out of their own are the eagle Centric reception in from the perception is that all we are is what is inside our skin. and it's inside and outside self another and the other is all very different and everyone here is some fortunately caring that habitual perception little bit right you know someone sitting next to you in the sea that's okay cuz they're in the theater but if you were sitting on a park bench assembly plants at that close to you treat what do they want from me like who is that because of your notion that did you versus the universe that's what I discovered. because that Cosmic basic idea that it is I don't want no need to us and everyone else is different then that puts us in impossible situation doesn't it who is it who is going to get enough attention from the world who's going to get enough out of the world who's not going to be overrun by into the number of other beings if you're different from all the other B. so where compassion comes is where. he was surprisingly discover you you lose yourself in some way to Art to meditation to understanding knowing that you have no boundary knowing your interconnectedness without there being you can experience yourself as the other beings when you see through the illusion of being separated from them. and when you do that you're forced to feel what they feel luckily they say I still not sure they say that when you reach that point because I didn't really want to leave it on the billionaire I don't have enough I need a hundred billion. so I'm like that imagine if I had to see other I even a hundred other people's suffering it would be terrible but apparently this is a strange Paradox of life when you're no longer a locked in yourself and as you did the wisdom of the intelligence of the scientific knowledge of the nature of the world that enables you to let your mind spread out and empathize and and enhance the basic human ability of emphasizing and realizing that you are the other be somehow by that opening you can see the deeper nature of life and you can you can you you get away from this terrible iron circle of like I mean Me Mine by The Beatles used to sing their day we really learned everything in the sixties too bad. nobody ever woke up to it and they trying to suppress it since then I me mine is like a perfect song that song the perfect teaching from Dad and become interested in all the other bees and we feel ourselves differently is totally strange is totally strange. the Dalai Lama was like to save he said that when you give birth in your mind you the idea of compassion because you realized that you yourself and your pains and pleasure finally to smaller theater for your intelligence it's really too boring whether your feet like this or like that the more you focus on how you feel by the way the worse it gets. like even when you're having a good time when is it good time over there good time is over when you think how good is it. and then it's never good enough. I love that Layla said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly on the physical plane or another planes is having a good time doing it by having a good time I think the Dalai Lama should have heard that I wish you didn't do here and he was told me he looked kind of sad that he was very much about the Haves and Have Nots and you'll tell me what's a hundred years ago they went and took everything away from the house to do the big Dominus revolutions Russia and China until they took it all the way by violin and then saying they were going to give it to everyone and then they were even worse and they didn't have so what could possibly be changed is terrible Gap that is opened up in the world today. and so then he looked at me so I know you're all in this yourself you teach its generosity was all I could think of was virtue but of course what you said I think the key to saving the world the key and compared the king of compassion is that it is more fun. it should be done by son generosity is more fun that's the key everybody had the wrong it was so boring and like this was surprised when they made a jolly. even though his people are being genocide didn't believe me he feels every blow on every old nuns head and every Chinese prison he feels it he feels it feels the way they're harvesting Yaks nowadays it I won't even say what they do because they you can't just do for what good does it do to add being miserable with others misery you have to find some Vision where you see how it is how it can be changed look at that beautiful thing that she's scared us with the lava man. he scared us with the love of man is coming. it's really lovely. show compassion compassion means to feel the feelings of others and the human being actually is compassion to human being is almost out of time are you going to be against compassion because what is our brain for now. Jim's Brayden is memorizing the almanac but he could memorize all the needs of all the beans and he is he will he did he could memorize what kind of fantastic things to help many dicks and he would have a tremendous fun doing that so the first person who gets happy when you stop focusing on the self-centered situation of how happy am I where you always dissatisfied as Mick Jagger told us. you never get any satisfaction that way so then you decide to kick it myself I'm going to think of how other people can't be happy I'm going to get up in the morning think of what can I do for this evening one other person even the dog bite my tat my pet my butterfly. and the first person who gets happy when you do that you don't do anything for anybody else but you get happier you and yourself because your whole perception broadens and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it and you realized that this being with these people is the flower garden that she has showed us it is Nirvana and my time is up and I know the Ten Commandments thank you,0.7604166269302368,
66,BonnieBassler_2009.sph.wav,the earth we've also made pro quorum sensing molecules so we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better remember you have these ten times or more bacterial cells in you or on you keeping you healthy what we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you in the hopes of making you more healthy making those conversations better so bacteria can do things that we want them to do better than they would be on their own at the best you're ten percent human but more likely about one percent human depending on which of these metrics you like i know you think of yourself as human beings but i think of you as ninety or ninety nine percent bacterial i hope when you learn things like about how the natural world works i just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child science is done by that demographic all of those people are between twenty and thirty years old and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country it's a really lucky demographic to work with i keep getting older and older they digest our food they make our vitamins they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out so they do all these amazing things that help us and are vital for keeping us alive that have no business being in you or on you at any time and if they are they make you incredibly sick so the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do or all the bad things that bacteria do the question we had is how could they do anything at all i mean they're incredibly small you have to have a microscope to see one they live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide and they've always been considered to be these asocial reclusive organisms what you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean named are the oldest living organisms on the earth they've been here for billions of years and what they are are single celled microscopic organisms this bacterium has the special property that it makes light so it makes bioluminescence like fireflies make light we're not doing anything to the cells here we just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room and this is what we see was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light but when the bacteria made light what we noticed is when the bacteria were alone so when they were in dilute suspension they made no light but when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously the question that we had is how can bacteria these primitive organisms tell the difference from times when they're alone and times when they're in a community and then all do something together when it's alone it doesn't make any light but what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules that you can think of like hormones and these are the red triangles and when the bacteria is alone the molecules just float away and so no light but when the bacteria grow and double and they're all participating in making these molecules the molecule the extracellular amount of that molecule increases in proportion to cell number so they are one cell and they have this special property that they only have one piece of dna they have very few genes and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out and when the molecule hits a certain amount that tells the bacteria how many neighbors there are they recognize that molecule and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony that's how bioluminescence works they're talking with these chemical words the reason that vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology again another plug for the and these house the vibrio fischeri cells they live in there at high cell number that molecule is there and they're making light the reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans is because it wants that light the way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid lives just off the coast of hawaii just in sort of shallow knee deep water the squid is nocturnal so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps but then at night it has to come out to hunt on bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in since it's just in those couple feet of water what the squid has developed is a shutter that can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back and it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom which is made by the bacterium exactly matches how much light hits the squid 's back so the squid doesn't make a shadow actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter illuminate itself in an anti predation device so predators can't see its shadow calculate its trajectory and eat it this is like the stealth bomber of the ocean but then if you think about it the squid has this terrible problem because it's got this dying thick culture of bacteria and it can't sustain that and so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep it buries itself in the sand and it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm and when the sun comes up it pumps out like ninety five percent of the bacteria now the bacteria are dilute that little hormone molecule is gone so they're not making light but of course the squid doesn't care it's asleep in the sand and as the day goes by the bacteria double they release the molecule and then light comes on at night exactly when the squid wants it and what we found so this is supposed to be again my bacterial cell is that vibrio fischeri has a protein that's the red box it's an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule the red triangle and then as the cells grow they're all releasing that molecule into the environment so there's lots of molecule there and the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule these are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells when the molecule increases to a certain amount which says something about the number of cells it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light and one cell becomes two and so on and so on they just grow and divide and grow and divide so a kind of boring life except that what i would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous glow in the dark bacterium that lives in the ocean all bacteria have systems like this so now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other they make chemical words they recognize those words and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison we have a fancy name for this we call it quorum sensing they vote with these chemical votes the vote gets counted and then everybody responds to the what's important for today 's talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions but the one that's probably the most important to you they wait they start growing they count themselves with these little molecules and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing that's how it works we also then went to look at what are these molecules these were the red triangles on my slides before this is the vibrio fischeri molecule this is the word that it talks with the left hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria but the right hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species what that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other so these are private secret conversations i know you guys think of yourself as humans and this is sort of how i think of you this man is supposed to represent a generic human being and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body these conversations are for intraspecies communication each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's its language that allows it to count its own siblings we got that far we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors but what we were really thinking about is that most of the time bacteria don't live by themselves they live in incredible mixtures with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria so we went back to molecular biology and started studying different bacteria and what we've found now is that in fact bacteria are multilingual they all have a species specific system they have a molecule that says me but then running in parallel to that is a second system that we've discovered that's generic so they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria it's used by all different bacteria and it's the language of interspecies communication what happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you they take that information inside and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who 's in the minority and who 's in the majority of any given population then again we turn to chemistry and we figured out what this generic molecule is that was the pink ovals on my last slide this is it it's a very small five carbon molecule what the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule so they're all using this molecule for interspecies communication this is the bacterial esperanto a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do we got that far we started to learn that bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language but what we started to think is that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well i've told you that bacteria do have all these social behaviors they communicate with these molecules of course i've also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing we thought what if we made these bacteria so they can't talk or they can't hear couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics of course you've just heard and you already know that we're running out of antibiotics bacteria are incredibly multi drug resistant right now and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use we kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants and so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases we thought well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications just make these bacteria so they can't talk they can't count and they don't know to launch virulence and so that's exactly what we've done and we've sort of taken two strategies the first one is we've targeted the intraspecies communication system so we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules which you saw but they're a little bit different and so they lock into those receptors and they jam recognition of the real thing the hope is that these will be used at broad spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria to finish i'll just show you the this one i'm just using the interspecies molecule but the logic is exactly the same what you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal in this case a mouse it doesn't initiate virulence right away it gets in it starts growing it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules it recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they're going to launch their attack and the animal dies what we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections but we give them in conjunction with our anti quorum sensing molecules so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing but they're a little bit different which i've depicted on this slide and of course it's the dna that counts so here 's all the a t gs and cs that make up your genetic code and give you all your charming characteristics what we now know is that if we treat the animal with a pathogenic bacterium a multi drug resistant pathogenic bacterium in the same time we give our anti quorum sensing molecule in fact the animal lives we think that this is the next generation of antibiotics and it's going to get us around at least initially this big problem of resistance what i hope you think is that bacteria can talk to each other they use chemicals as their words they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we're just now starting to learn about of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular so in the spirit of ted they're doing things together because it makes a difference is that bacteria have these collective behaviors and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals what i would hope that i could further argue to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity bacteria have been on the earth for billions of years humans couple hundred thousand we think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular you have about thirty thousand genes well it turns out you have one hundred times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life we know that the principles and the rules if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well i hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from other by using these two molecules they can say me and they can say you again of course that's what we do both in a molecular way and also in an outward way but i think about the molecular stuff this is exactly what happens in your body again we think that bacteria invented that and you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study the final thing is again just to reiterate that there's this practical part and so we've made these anti quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics but then to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live,1,bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth they've been here for billions of years and what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms so they're one cell and they have the special property that they only have one piece of DNA span Ferry few genes and Smith information to encode all of the traits that they carry out and the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment they grow to twice their size they cut themselves down in the middle and one cell becomes too and so on and so on so they just grow and divide and grow and divide so kind of boring life except that what I would argue but you have an amazing interaction with these Critters I know you guys think of yourself as humans and this is sort of how I think of you and so this man is supposed to represent a generic human being and all of the circles in that man are all the cells that make up your body so there's not a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do but you have 10 trillion bacterial cells in you. on you at any moment in your life so ten times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being as of course it's the DNA that count so here's all the 80s that make up your genetic code and give you all your Charming characteristics so you have about thirty thousand genes Will turns out you have a hundred times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life and so the best your 10% human more more likely about 1% human depending on which of these metrics you like so I know you think of yourself as human beings but I think you do is 90 or 92.9% bacterial. and these picture you are not passive Riders these are incredibly important they Keep Us Alive they cover Us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy they digest our food they make our vitamins they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out so they do all these amazing things to help us and in our Vital for keeping us alive and they never get any press for that but they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well so there's all kinds of bacteria on the earth that have no business being in you are on you at any time and if they are they make you incredibly sick answer the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do are all the bad things that bacteria do the question we had a talk and they do anything at all I mean they're incredibly small you have to have a microscope to see once they live the soaring sort of boring life for they grow and divide and they've always been considered to be these. a social reclusive organisms seemed to us that they're just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals and so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different ways that bacteria live and the clue to this came from another Marine bacterium and it's a bacterium called the real fish fry and to what you're looking at on this flight is just a person from my lab holding the flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean names are Bill fish right and this bacterium has the special property that it makes light so it makes bioluminescence like fireflies make light door not doing anything to the cells here we just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room and this is what we see I was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made Lightfoot when the bacteria made light of what we noticed is when the bacteria were alone so when they were in Duluth suspension they made no light but when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria. turn down light simultaneously answer the question that we had is how can bacteria these primitive organisms tell the difference from times on their loan and times when they're in a community and then all do something together and what we figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other and they talked with a chemical language so this is now supposed to be my bacterial cell when it's alone it doesn't make any light but what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules that you can think of like hormones and these are the red triangles and when the bacteria dies alone the molecules just float away and so no light but when the bacteria grow and double and they're all participating in making these molecules the molecule the extracellular amount of that molecule increases in proportion to cell number and when the molecules gets a certain amount that tells the bacteria how many neighbors they are they recognize that molecule in all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony and so that's. spell bioluminescence works there talking with this chemical words and the reason to disturb you officer is doing that comes from the biology so again another 11 for the animals in the ocean that lives in the squid what you're looking at is the Hawaiian bobtail squid and it's been turned on its back and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes and these house the real fish rice else they live in there at Hartselle number that molecule is there and they're making light and the reason the squid is willing to put up with these Shenanigans is because it wants that light inside the way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid live just off the coast of Hawaii who just a sort of shallow knee-deep water and ask what is nocturnal so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps but then at night it has to come out to hunt and so on bright nights when there's lots of Starlight or moonlights that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lips and since it's just in those couple feet of water and what the squid has developed is a shutter they cannot. close over this specialized light Oregon housing the bacteria and then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much Starlight or Moonlight is hitting its back and it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom which is made by the bacterium exactly matches how much like hits the squids back to the squid doesn't make a Shadow who actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter illuminated self in anti predation device and so it's so predators can't see its shadow calculated trajectory and eat it so this is like the stealth bomber of the ocean. but then if you think about it the squid has this terrible problem because it's that is dying stick culture of bacteria and it can't sustain that and see what happens is every morning when the sun comes up to Squid goes back to sleep and buries itself in the sand and it's got to pump this attached with circadian rhythm and when the sun comes up it pumps out like 95% of the bacteria and so now that bacteria are dilute that little hormone molecule has gone so they're not making light but of course this wind doesn't care it's asleep in the sand and it's the day goes by the bacteria double they released the molecule and then light comes on at night exactly when the squid wants it and so first we figured out how and this bacterium does this but then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this to figure out really what's the mechanism and what we found so this is now supposed to be again my bacterial cell is it the real fish fry has a protein that's the Redbox it's an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule the red triangle and then as the cells bro they're all releasing that molecule into the environment so there's. lots of molecule bear and the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule these are just like The receptors on the surfaces of yourselves and see when the molecule increases to a certain amount which says something about the number of cells it looks down into that receptor and information comes into the self that tells the self to turn on this Collective behavior of making light and why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found it this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean all bacteria have systems like this so now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other they make Chemical words they recognize those words and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison it so now we have a fancy name for this we call it Quorum sensing they vote with these chemical votes the boat gets counted and then everybody responds to the vote. and what's important for today's talks is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these Collective Fashions but the one that's probably the most important to you is very lips so it's not like a couple back to hear you get in you and then they start secreting some toxins your enormous that would have no effect on you your fuge but what they do we Now understand is they didn't you they wait they start growing they can't help themselves with these little molecules and they recognize when they have the right cell number did all of the bacterial launch their virulent attack together they're going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host. Always control package in a city with Quorum sensing and so that's how it works we also then went to look at one of these molecules so these were the red triangles on my slides before and this is the biblio fish run molecule this is the word that it talks with enemy started to look at other bacteria and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered and what I hope you can see is it the molecules are real. made it to the left him part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria but the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species and what that does is 24 Exquisite species specificities to these languages to each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other so these are private secret conversations these conversations are for interspecies communication which bacteria uses a particular molecule that sit line its language that allows it to count its own siblings. it's a once we got that far we thought we were starting to understand the facts Syria have these social behaviors but we started what we really thinking about us that most of the time bacteria don't live by themselves they live in incredible mixtures with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria and that's depicted on this side this is your skin so this is just a picture of micrograph of your skin anywhere on your body it looks pretty much like this and what I hope you can see if there's all kinds of bacteria there as we started to think if this really is about Communication in bacteria and it's about counting your neighbors it's not enough to be able to only talk within your species there has to be a way to take a census of the rest of the bacteria in the population so we went back to molecular biology and started studying different bacteria and what we found now is that in fact bacteria are multilingual so they all have a species specific system they have a molecule that says me but then running in parallel to that is the second system that we've discovered its generic so they have a. second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria it's used by all different bacteria and it's the language of interspecies communication and so what happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you and they take that information inside and they decide what task to carry out depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority of Any Given population and so then again we turn to chemistry and we figured out what this generic molecule is so that was the pink ovals on my last like this is it it's a very small five carbon molecule and what the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule so they're all using this molecule for interspecies communication so this is the bacterial Esperanto. and so once we got that far we've started to learn the bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language but we started think it said maybe there's something practical that we can do here as well so I told you the bacteria do you have all these social behaviors that they communicate with these molecules and of course I've also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate pathogen Issa tea using Quorum sensing so we thought what if we made these bacteria so they can't talk or they can't hear couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics and of course you just hurt and you already know that we're running out of antibiotics that you are incredibly multi-drug resistant right now and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria so they either pop the bacterial membrane they make that bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA we kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that's the wax for resistant mutants and so now of course we have this Global problem in infectious diseases so we thought we would if we could sort of do behavior modification is just make these bacteria so they can. talk the key account and they don't know to lunch. Once I said that's exactly what we've done and we sort of Taken 2 strategies the first one is we've targeted the Intrust BC's Communication System tweak made molecules to look kind of like the real molecules which you saw but they're a little bit different and so they locked into those receptors and they Jam recognition of the real thing and soap by targeting the red system what we were able to do is to make species-specific or disease-specific anti Quorum sensing molecules we've also done the same thing with the pink system we've taken that Universal molecule and then turned it around a little bit so that we've made in tagonist of the interspecies communication system and these the hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria it so to finish I'll just show you the strategy and this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule but their logic is exactly the same so what you know is that the one that bacterium gets into the animal in this case a mouse. doesn't initiate virulent right away it gets in it starts growing it start screaming it's Quorum sensing molecules it recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they're going to launch their attack and the animal dies and see what we've been able to do is to give these virulent inspections but we give them in conjunction with our anti Quorum sensing molecule so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing but they're a little bit different which depicted on this flight and what we now know is it if we treat the animal with a pathogenic bacteria multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria in the same time we give our anticore sensing molecule in fact the animal lives and so we think that this is the next generation of antibiotics and it's going to get us around at least initially this big problem of resistance so what I help you think is the best. Can't talk to each other they use chemicals as their words that have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we're just now starting to learn about and of course what that allows bacteria to do. is to be multicellular right and so in the spirit of Ted they're doing things together because it makes a difference right so what happens if the bacteria have these Collective behavior and they carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply active as individuals and if and what I would hope that I could further argued to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity bacteria have been on the earth on the earth for billions of years humans couple hundred thousand so we think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular organization works and and we think by spreading bacterial we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body do we know that the principles in the rules if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well. I hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish yourself from other so by using these two molecules that can save me and they can say you and again of course that's what we do both as molecular in a molecular weight and then also in an outward way but I think about the molecular stuff this is exactly what happens in your body it's not like your heart cells in your kidney cells do mixed up every day and that's because there's all of this chemistry going on these molecules could say who which of these groups of cells has and what their tasks should be and so again we think it's a bacterial invented that and then you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles but all of the ideas are in the simple systems that we can study and then the final thing is again just to reiterate that there's this practical part and so we made these anti Quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutic but then to finish with a plug for all the good in miraculous fixed. That lived on the earth we've also made pro corn since he molecule so we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better. number you have these 10 times with or more bacterial cells in your on you keeping you healthy but we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualist with you in the hopes of making you more healthy making those conversations better to bacteria can do things that we want them to do buy any better than they would be on their own and then finally I wanted to show you this is my gang at Princeton New Jersey everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture and I hope when you learn things like about how the natural world works I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child so science is done by that demographic they are all of those people are between 20 and 30 years old and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country and it's a really lucky demographic to work with I keep getting older and older and they're always the same age and it's just and a crazy delightful job. and I want to thank you for inviting me here it's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference,0.7630208134651184,
67,Bono_2005.sph.wav,i have been of late disappointed with the bush administration they started out with such promise on africa they made some really great promises and actually have fulfilled a lot of them but some of them they haven 't they don't feel the push from the ground is the truth but my disappointment has much more perspective when i talk to american people and i hear their worries about the deficit the fiscal well being of their country i understand that but there's much more push from the ground than you'd think if we got organized what i try to communicate and you can help me if you agree is that aid for africa is just great value for money at a time when america really needs it putting it in the crassest possible terms the investment reaps huge returns not only in lives saved but in goodwill stability and security that we'll gain so this is what i hope that you will do if i could be so bold and not have it deducted from my number of wishes what i hope is that beyond individual merciful acts that you will tell the politicians to do right by if you wanted to make a film you needed a mass of equipment and a hollywood budget now you need a camera that fits in your by america and by the world give them permission if you like to spend their political capital and your financial your national purse on saving the lives of millions of people that's really what i would like you to do because we also need your intellectual capital your ideas your skills your ingenuity and you at this conference are in a unique position some of the technologies we've been talking about you invented pushed the boundaries and we'd like you to a lot of people are getting together and working under this umbrella i told you about earlier the one campaign i think they just have one idea in their mind which is where you live in the world should not determine whether you live and a couple of bucks for a blank dvd imagination has been like god is watching what we do when the history books get written i think our age will be remembered for three things really it's just three things this whole age will be remembered for the digital revolution yes the war against terror yes and what we did or did not do to put out the fires some say we can't afford to i say we can't afford not to the ones that ted has offered to grant you see if this is true and i believe it is that the digital world you all created has the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter this should be a piece from the old constraints and that really really excites me i'm excited when i glimpse that kind of thinking that this started out as a wishes most of them impossible some of them impractical and one or two of them certainly immoral business gets to be addictive you know what i mean when somebody else is picking up the anyway here 's number one i wish for you to help build a social movement of more than one million american activists my first wish i believe it's possible a few minutes ago i talked about all the citizens campaigns that are springing up you know there's lots out there and with this one campaign as our umbrella my organization data and other groups have been tapping into the energy and well the enthusiasm that's out there from hollywood into the heartland of america we know there's more than enough energy to power this movement we just need your help in making it happen we want all of you here church america corporate america microsoft america apple america coke america pepsi america nerd america noisy america writ large what i would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints political economic psychological whatever we can't afford to be cool and sit this one out i do believe if we build a movement that's one million americans strong we will have the ear of congress be the first page in condi rice 's briefing book and right into the oval office if there's one million americans and i really know this who are ready to make phone calls who are ready to be on email i am absolutely sure that we can actually change the course of history literally for the continent of africa anyway so i'd like your help in getting that signed up i know john number two i would like one media hit for every person on the planet who is living on less than one dollar a day one billion media hits could be on google could be on aol steve case larry sergey they've done a lot already could be nbc it could be abc actually we're talking to abc today about the oscars we have a film produced by jon kamen at radical media but you know we want we need some airtime for our ideas we need to get the math we need to get the statistics out to the american people i really believe that old truman line that if you give the american people the facts they'll do the right thing and the other thing that's important is that this is not sally struthers this has to be described as an adventure not a burden one by one they step forward a nurse a teacher a homemaker and lives are saved the problem is enormous every three seconds one person dies another three seconds one more the geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world from the as one we can beat extreme poverty starvation aids we need your help one more person letter voice will mean the difference between life and death for millions of people please join us by working together americans have an unprecedented opportunity we can make history we can start to make poverty history one by one by one please visit one at this address we're not asking for your money we're asking for your voice all right i wish for ted to truly show the power of information its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives by connecting every hospital health with which you swept away obstacles that no one knew could even be budged and that's actually what i'd like to talk about today and school in one african country and i would like it to be ethiopia i believe we can connect every school in ethiopia every health clinic every hospital we can connect to the internet that is my wish my third wish i think it's possible i think we have the money and brains in the room to do that and that would be a mind blowing wish to come true i've been to ethiopia as i said earlier it's actually where it all started for me the idea that the internet which changed all of our lives can transform a country and a continent that has hardly made it to analog let alone digital blows my mind but it didn't start was just nine years later that addis ababa was connected by phone to harare which is five hundred kilometers away since then not that much has changed the average waiting time to get a land line in ethiopia is actually about seven or eight wireless technology wasn't dreamt up then anyway i'm irish and as you can see i know how important talking is first though i should probably explain why and how i got to this place it's a journey that started twenty years ago you may remember that song we are the world or do they know it's christmas band aid live aid another very tall was a great moment and it utterly changed my life that summer my wife ali and myself went to ethiopia we went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on we lived in ethiopia for a month working at an orphanage the children had a name for me they called me the girl with the don't ask anyway we found africa to be a magical place big shining continent beautiful royal people anybody who ever gave anything to africa got a lot more back ethiopia didn't just blow my mind it opened my mind anyway on our last day at this orphanage a man handed me his baby and said would you take my son with you he knew in ireland that his son would live and that in ethiopia his son would die it was the middle of that awful famine well i turned him down and was a funny kind of sick feeling but i turned him down and it's a feeling i can't ever quite forget thank you very much as another famous man jerry garcia said what a strange long trip and in that moment i started this journey in that moment i became the worst thing of all i became a rock star with except this isn't the cause is it six and a half thousand africans dying every single day from aids a preventable treatable disease for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy that's not a cause that's an emergency eleven million aids orphans in africa twenty million by the end of the decade that's not a cause an emergency so what we're talking about here is human rights the right to live like a human the right to live period and what we're facing in africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality this is about justice really this is not about charity this is about justice and he should have said what a strange long trip it's about to become at this very moment you are viewing my upper half my lower half is appearing at a different that's right and that's too bad because we're very good at charity americans like irish people are good even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford we like to give and we give a lot look at the response to the tsunami it's inspiring but justice is a tougher standard than charity you see africa makes a fool of our idea of justice it makes a farce of our idea of equality it mocks our pieties it doubts our concern it questions our because there is no way we can look at what's happening in africa and if we're honest conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else as you heard in the film anywhere else not here not here not in america not in europe a head of state that you're all familiar with admitted this to me really true there is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accepted anywhere else other than africa africa is a continent in flames and deep down if we really accepted that africans were equal to us we would all do more to put the fire out we're standing around with watering cans what we really need is the fire brigade you see it's not as dramatic as the tsunami crazy really when you think about it does stuff have to look like an action movie these days to exist in the front of our brain the slow extinguishing of countless lives is just not dramatic enough it would appear anyway i believe that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual rigor in this room i want to argue with you tonight that that's our crisis i want to argue that though africa is not the front line in the war against terror it could be soon every week religious extremists take another african village they're attempting to bring order to chaos well why aren't we poverty breeds despair we know this despair breeds violence we know this in turbulent times isn't it cheaper and smarter to make friends out of potential enemies than to defend yourself against them later the war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty two places at once but still i'm sorry i can't be with you in person i'll explain at another and i didn't say that colin powell said that now when the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won by military might alone maybe we should listen there's an opportunity here and it's real it's not spin it's not wishful thinking the problems facing the developing world afford us in the developed world a chance to re describe ourselves to the world we will not only transform other people 's lives but we will also transform the way those other lives see us and that might be smart in these nervous dangerous times don't you think that on a purely commercial level that anti retroviral drugs great advertisements for western ingenuity and technology doesn't compassion look well on us and let 's cut the crap for a second in certain quarters of the world brand eu brand usa is not at its shiniest the neon sign is fizzing and someone 's put a brick through the window the regional branch managers are getting nervous never before have we in the west been so scrutinized our values do we have any our credibility time and though i'm a rock star i just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub but what really turns me on about technology these things are under attack around the world brand usa could use some polishing and i say that as a fan you know as a person who buys the products but think about it more anti retrovirals make sense but that's just the easy part equality for africa that's a big expensive idea you see the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference what on earth can we all do well much more than we think we can't fix every problem but the ones we can i want to argue we must and because we can we must this is the straight truth the righteous truth it is not a theory the fact is that ours is the first generation that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye look across the ocean to africa and say this and mean it we do not have to stand for this a whole continent written off we do not have to stand for this let me say this without a trace of irony before i back it up to a bunch of ex hippies forget the sixties we can change the world i can 't you can 't as individuals but we can change the world i really believe that the people in this room look at the gates foundation they've done incredible stuff unbelievable stuff is not just the ability to get more songs on mp three players the revolution this revolution is much bigger than that but working together we can actually change the world we can turn the inevitable outcomes and transform the quality of life for millions of lives who look and feel rather like us when i'm sorry to laugh here but you do look so different than you did in haight ashbury in the sixties but i want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for it is the flowering of the seeds you planted in earlier headier days ideas that you gestated in your youth this is what excites me this room was born for this moment is really what i want to say to you tonight most of you started out wanting to change the world most of you did the digital world well now actually because of you it is possible to change the physical and they know much more than i do so why then are we not pumping our fists into the air probably because when we admit we can do something about it we've got to do something about it it is pain in the arse this equality business is actually a pain in the arse but for the first time in history we have the technology we have the know how we have the cash we have the life saving drugs do we have the will i hope this is obvious but i'm not a hippie and i'm not really one for the warm fuzzy feeling i do not have flowers in my hair actually i come from punk rock the clash wore big army boots not but i know toughness when i see it and for all the talk of peace and love on the west coast there was muscle to the movement that started out here you see idealism detached from action is just a dream but idealism allied with pragmatism with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit is very exciting it's very real it's very strong and it's very present in a crowd like you last year at data this organization i helped set up we launched a campaign to summon this spirit in the fight against aids and extreme poverty we're calling it the one campaign it's based on our belief that the action of one person can change a lot but the actions of many coming together as one can change the world well we feel that now is the time to prove we're right there are moments in history when civilization redefines itself we believe this is one we believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides that the wanton loss of life in africa is just no longer who live on planet earth momentum has been building lurching a little but it's building this year is a test for us all especially the leaders of the g eight nations who really are on the line here with all the world in history watching,1,"well I sent as Alexander Graham Bell famously said on his first successful telephone call. hello is it is at Domino's Pizza thank you very much is another famous man Jerry Garcia said and what a strange long trip and we should have said to become my lower half is appearing at a different company.you can turn Zack be in two places at once but still I'm sorry I can't be with you in person I'll be staying at another time then do I'm a Rockstar I just want to assure you that none of my wishes willing to the hot tub but what really turns me on to buy technology is not just the ability to get more songs on MP3 players the revolution this revolution is much bigger than that I hope I believe what turns me on what excites me personally is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing. she used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song you needed a studio and a producer you needed a laptop now you needed a massive massive equipment in the Hollywood Bridges now you need a camera that fits in your palm and a couple of books for a blank DVD imagination has been decoupled from the old constraints I'm not really really excites me I'm excited when I claimed that kind of thinking writ large but I would like to see his idealism decoupled idealism the couples from o constraints political-economic biological whatever. the geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world from the ease with which you Swept Away obstacles that knowing you could even be budged and that's actually what I'd like to talk about it today. first though I should probably explain why and how I got to this place.it's a journey that started 20 years ago. you may remember that song We Are the World or do they know it's Christmas Band-Aid Live Aid another very tall result Rockstar my friend sir Bob Geldof issued a challenge to see the world was a great moments and it totally changed my life. that summer my wife Ally and myself went to Ethiopia to see what was going on we lived in Ethiopia for a month working at an orphanage. the children have a name for me they called me the girl with the beard. don't ask as anyway we found I forget to be a a magical place big Skies big hearts big shining continent beautiful Royal people anybody who ever gave anything to Africa got a lot more back Ethiopia didn't just. blow my mind it is it open my mind. anyway on our last day at this orphanage a man handed me his baby. NSAID. would you take my son with you and he knew in Ireland that his son would live. I'm not in Ethiopia his son would die in the middle of that awful family. well I turned him down. and I. that was a funny kind of sick feeling but I turned them down into feeling I can never quite forget I did not moment I I started this journey in that moment I became the worst thing of all I became a rock star with a cup. except this isn't the cause is it. six and a half thousand Africans dying every single day from AIDS a preventable treatable disease for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy that's not a cause is it not that that's an emergency 11 million AIDS orphans in Africa 20 million by the end of the decade that's not caused. that's an emergency today everyday 9,000 more applicants will catch HIV because of stigmatisation and lack of Education that's not a cost. it's an emergency. so what we're talking about here is is human rights the right to live like a human. the right to live. Mobile facing in Africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality. the next thing I'd like to be clear about his what this problem is. I want this problem isn't because this is not all about charity. this is about Justice really. this is not about charity this is about Justice. that's right that's too bad because that we're very good at charity Americans like Irish people are our go-to this even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford we like to give me give a lost look at the response to the tsunamis it's inspiring. but Justice is a tougher standard than charity is he. African makes a fool of our idea of Justice equality and questions are commitment. because there is no way we can look at what's happening in Africa and if we're honest conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else as you heard in the film anywhere else not here all here not in America not in Europe. in fact a head of state that you're all familiar with admitted this to me that's really true there's no chance it's kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accepted anywhere else other than Africa. Africa is a continent in flames and deep down if we really accepted that Africans were equal to us we would all do more to put the fire at we're standing around with watering cans. and what we really need is a fire brigade will see it's it's not as dramatic. has a tsunami. crazy ready. you think about it just don't have to look like an action movie these days to exist in the front of our brain the slow Extinction of countless lives. catastrophes that we can avert are not as interesting as ones we could divert. funny that. anyway I believe that kind of thinking offends the intellectual rigor. in this room. 6000 people dying a day in Ephrata maybe Africa's crisis but the fact that is not on the 19 years that we in Europe are you in America are not treating it like an emergency I want to argue with you tonight but that's our crisis I want to argue but though Africa is not the front line in the war against Terror it could be soon every week religious extremist take another African village they're attempting to bring order to chaos well. why aren't we poverty breeds despair we know this despair breeds violence me know this interview at times cheaper and smarter to make friends at a potential enemies than to defend yourself against them later. the war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty. and I didn't say that Colin Powell said that the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won by military might alone maybe we should listen. is an opportunity here. and it's real. Then not wishful thinking the problems facing the developing World afford US in the developed world at Chancery describe ourselves to the world. we will not only transform other people's life but we will also transform the way those other lives see us and that might be smart and he's nervous dangerous times. don't you think that on a purely commercial level the antiretroviral drugs are great advertisement for Western Ingenuity and Technology doesn't look well enough in certain quarters of the World Brandy you run USA is not out of shiniest. the neon sign is fizzing and cracking. someone put a brick through the window the regional branch managers are getting nervous. never before have we in the west being so scrutinized our values do we have any credibility these things are under attack around the world brand USA. could use some polishing and I say that as a fan you know as a person who buys the products but think about it more and they sense that's just the easy part or off to be. equality for Africa. that's a big expensive idea. you see the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference what on Earth can we all do about this. well much more than we think we can't fix every problem but the ones we can I want to argue we must because we can we must. this is the straight truth the righteous truth is not a theory the fact is that ours is the first generation that can look disease and extreme poverty in the I look across the ocean to Africa and say this and mean it we do not have to stand for this a whole continent written-off we do not have to stand for this. so. let me say this without a trace of irony and before I back it up to a bunch of X hippies forget the 60s. we can change the world I can you can't as individuals but we can change the world I really believe that the people in this room are going to Gates Foundation that's an incredible stuff unbelievable stuff but working together we can actually change the world we can turn the inevitable outcomes and transform the quality of life for millions of Lives who look and feel rather like us when you're up close. I'm sorry to laugh you but you do look. so different than you did in Haight-Ashbury in the sixties but I want to argue that this is the moment. tight you are designed for it is the flowering of the seeds you planted in earlier heavier days. ideas that you just stated in your youth this is what excites me this room was born for this moment is really what I want to say to you tonight have you started at 1 and to change the world in you most of you did the digital world well now actually because of you it is possible to change the physical world is a fact, and they know much more than I do so why then are we not pumping our fifth. into the air probably because when we admit we can do something about it. we've got to do something about us. it is. pain in the ass to the equality business is actually a pain in the ass but for the first time in history we have the technology we have the know-how we have the cash we have the life-saving drugs. do we have the will. I hope this is a obvious but. I'm not a hippie and I'm not really one for the warm fuzzy feeling I'm mad I do not have flowers in my hair actually I I come from punk rock and The Clash for big army boots not sandals but I know toughness when I see it I'm for all the talk of peace and love on the west coast there was muscle. to the movement that started at here. you see idealism detach from action AAA is just a dream. but idealism allied with pragmatism with rolling up your sleeves and making the world Bandit B. it's very exciting is very real it's very strong and it's very present in a crowd like you. last year at Dayton this organization to help set up we launched the campaign to someone this spirit in the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty were calling it the one campaign. based on our belief. at the action of one person can change a lot for the actions of many coming together as one can change the world. well we feel that now is the time to prove where right there are moments in history when civilization redefines itself. we believe this is one we believe that this could be the time when the world finally decide I don't want and loss of life in Africa is just no longer acceptable this could be the time we finally get serious about changing the future. for most people who lives on planet Earth momentum has been building. flirting a little but it's building this year is at estrus all especially the leaders of the G8 Nations who really are on the line here with all the world in history watching. I have been up late disappointed with the Bush Administration and they started out with such promise on Africa and make some really great promises and actually have fulfilled a lot of them but but some of them they happened they don't feel the push from the ground is truth. remind disappointment has much more perspective when I talk to American people and I hear that worries about the deficit and the physical well-being of their country understand that but there's much more push from the ground than you'd think if we got organized. but I tried communicating you can help me if you agree is that aid for Africa is just great value for money at a time when America really needs it putting it in the in the fastest possible terms. the investment rapes huge returns not only in life saved putting Goodwill stability and security that will gain. this is what I hope that you will do if I could be so bold and not have it deducted from my my number of wishes. well I hope what I hope is that Beyond individual merciful Act. but you will tell the politicians to do right by Africa by America on by the world give them permission if you like to spend their political capital and your financial Capital your National purse on saving the lives of millions of people that's really what you like you to do. because we also need your intellectual Capital your ideas your skills your ingenuity. and that you at this conference are are in a unique position some of the Technologies we been talkin about you invented them or at least revolutionize the way that they're used together. You have changed the Zeitgeist from analog to digital. I'm pushed pushed the boundaries and then we'd like you to. give us that energy give us that kind of dreaming that kind of doing other things to things on the line here that the continent Africa. but there's also a sense of ourselves. people are starting to figure this out movement to spring it on Parts as politicians pop stars priest CEOs ngos mother's Union student unions. a lot of people are getting together and working. under this umbrella I told you but I got the one campaign II I think they just have one idea in their mind which is. where you live in the world should not determine whether you live in the world. history. history like God Is Watching what we do when the history books get written I think our age will be remembered for three things really it's just three things with it. this whole area will be remembered for the digital Revolution yes the war against their yes. and what we did. or did not do to put out the fires in Africa. some say we can't afford to. I say. we can't afford not to thank you. okay my tree Wishes the ones that add. has offered to Grant. you see if this is true and I believe it is.. The digital world you all created as uncoupled the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter. they should be a piece of piss. I should add that this started out as a much longer than three wishes most of them and possible some of them in Practical and one or two of them certainly Amaro. is business and gets to be addictive when somebody else is picking up the tab and anyway here's number one. I wish for you to help. build a social movement. of more than 1 million American activist traffic. as my first wish I believe it's possible few minutes ago I took the bag to all the citizen campaigns that are springing up this. you know this is a lot of time there and it would this one campaign as our umbrella my organization paid and other groups have been tapping into the energy and and the enthusiasm that back. From Hollywood into the heartland of America we know there's more than enough energy to power this Movement we just need your help. and making it happen we want to hear Church America Corporate America Microsoft America Apple America Copa America Pepsi American American noisy America we we we can't afford to be cool and set this when I die I do believe if we build a movement that's one minute American strong we're not going to be tonight we will have the ear of Congress and. and will be the first page and County Rice's briefing book and and I'm riding to the Oval Office has 1 million Americans and I really know this who are ready to make phone calls or ready to be on email I am absolutely sure that we can actually change the course of history for for from literally with Continental African anyway so I'd like your help in getting that signed up I am I know John Cage and Sun Microsystems already on board for this but with lots of you we like to to talk to write my second wish. number two. I would like one media hit. every person on the planet. who is living on less than a dollar a day. 1 billion media heads could be on Google could be on a well Steve case already. done a lot already could be in d.c. could be ABC actually we're talking to ABC today about the Oscars we have a film produced by John came in at radical me but you know we want we need some air time for our ideas we need to get the mess we need to get the statistics on the American people I really believe that old Truman lined up it if you get the American people of facts that they'll do the right thing and do the thing that's important is it this is this is this has to be described as an adventure not a burden one by one they step forward as a teacher and the problem is enormous nice another 3 seconds or more the situation is so desperate and parts of Africa Asia from America. that's one acting as one we can beat extreme poverty starvation AIDs that we need your help one more person letter voice will mean the difference between life and death to millions of people please join us by working together we can make history we can start to make poverty history one by one by one please visit one at this address we're not asking for your money for asking for your voice. I wish for 10. the truly show the power of information it's its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives by connecting every Hospital health clinic and school in one African country and I would like it to be Ethiopian I believe we can connect Every Woman Ethiopia Health Clinic every hospital we can connect to the internet that is my wish my third wish I could possible I think we have the money and brains in the room to do that and that would be a mind-blowing wish to come through I things easy out here as I said earlier it's exactly where it all. stockings for me. the idea that the internet which changed all of our Lives can transform a country. and the continent that is. hardly made it to analog let alone digital blows my mind but it didn't start out that way. the first long-distance line from Boston to New York was used in 1885 on the phone. was just 9 years later but Addis Ababa was connected by phone to Harare we just 500 km away. since then not that much has changed the average. waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopia is actually about seven or eight years Wireless technology and then anyway I I'm Irish as long as you can see I know how important talkin is communication very important will transform the country at a training pharmacist been able to order supplies doctors showing their expertise in all aspects of medicine it's a very very good idea to get them wired about is my third and final wish for you at the Ted conference thank you very much once again",0.74609375,
68,BrendaLaurel_1998.sph.wav,things worth doing because they're good things to do and that clear eyed empiricism can help us figure out how to do them so contrary to popular belief there is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values what it would take to get a little girl to put her hands on a computer to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology that little boys have because they play video games we spent two and a half years conducting research we spent another year and a half in advance development then we formed a spin off company and the research phase of the project at interval we partnered with a company called cheskin research and these people and they did not do the incredibly stupid thing of saying to a child of all these things we already make you which do you like best which gives you zero answer that's usable so what we did for the first two and a half years was four things we did an extensive review of the literature in related fields like cognitive psychology spacial cognition gender studies play theory sociology primatology thank you frans de waal wherever you are i love you and i'd give anything to meet you after we had done that with a pretty large team of people and discovered what we thought the salient issues were with girls and boys and playing because after all that's really what this is about we moved to the second phase of our work where we interviewed adult experts in academia some of the people who 'd produced the literature that we found relevant and also we did focus groups with people who were on the ground with kids every day like playground supervisors talked to them then we did what i consider to be the heart of the work interviewed one thousand one hundred children boys and girls ages seven to twelve all over united states except for silicon valley boston and austin because we knew that their little families would have millions of computers in them and they wouldn't be a representative sample and at the end of those remarkable conversations with kids and their best friends across the united states after two years we pulled together some survey data from another ten thousand children drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics for designing computer based products and in fact any kind of products for little girls ages eight to twelve i met with david to talk about what i might do in his company i was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business and supporting my self by being on the speaking circuit and writing books that has now served twenty five million pages and has forty two thousand registered young girl users who spend an average of they visit an average of one and a half times a day spend an average of thirty five minutes a visit and look at fifty pages so we feel that we've formed a successful online community with girls we launched two titles in october rockett 's new school which is the first of a series of products about a character called rockett beginning her first day of school in eighth grade at a brand new place with a blank slate which allows girls to play with the question of what will i be like when i'm older what 's it going to be like to be in high school or junior high school who are my friends to exercise the love of social complexity and the narrative intelligence that drives most of their play behavior and which embeds in it values about noticing that we have lots of choices in our lives and the ways that we conduct ourselves the other title that we launched is called secret paths in the forest that addresses the more fantasy oriented inner lives of girls these two titles both showed up in the top fifty entertainment titles in pc data entertainment titles in pc data in december right up there with john madden football which thrills me to death so we're real and we've touched several hundreds of thousands of little girls now then after twenty years or so in the computer game industry we've made half a billion impressions with marketing and pr for this brand purple moon ninety six percent of them roughly have been positive four percent of them have been other i want to talk about the other because the politics of this enterprise in a way have been the most fascinating part of it really two kinds of negative reviews that we've received one kind of reviewer is a male gamer who thinks he knows what games ought to be and won 't show the product to little girls the other kind of reviewer is a certain flavor of feminist who thinks they know what little girls ought to be having ideas that people didn't think they could sell it's funny to me that these interesting odd bedfellows have one thing in common they don't listen to little girls they haven't looked at children like to play you some voices of little girls from the two and a half years of research that we did actually some of the voices are more recent and these voices will be accompanied by photographs that they took for us of their lives of the things that they value and care about these are pictures the girls themselves never saw but they gave to us this is the stuff those reviewers don't know about and aren't listening to and this is the kind of research i recommend to you who want to do humanistic work yeah my character is usually a tomboy her 's is what else and all those we make newspaper on the computer for a girl 's game also usually they'll have really you and i love a lot of things to do and sometimes i sometimes it gets annoying when you brothers and sisters or brother or sister when they copy you and you get your idea first and they take your idea and they do it themselves she this is the second day in rockett 's life and the reason i'm showing you this is i'm hoping that the scene that i'm going to show you will look familiar and sound familiar now that you've listened to some girls voices just be a giant sexist conspiracy these people aren't that smart there's six billion dollars on the table and you can see how we've tried to incorporate the issues that matter to them in asked me to make sure you knew about awful event occurs rocket gets want to 's so we're going to emotionally navigate if we were playing the game that's what we'd do if at any time during the game we want to learn more about the characters we can go into this hidden hallway and i'll quickly just show you the interface we can for example go find miko 's locker they would go for it if they could figure out how so what is the deal here girls their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility and to play around with the social complexity of their lives i want to make the point that what we're giving girls i think through this effort is a kind of validation a sense of being seen and a sense of the choices that are available in their lives we love them we see them we're not trying to but we're really really happy about who they are it turns out they're really great i want to close by showing you and as we thought about our goals i should say that interval is really a humanistic institution in the classical sense that humanism at its best finds a way to combine clear eyed empirical research with a set of core values that fundamentally love and respect people the basic idea of humanism is the improvable quality of life that we can do good things that there are,1,"back in 1992 I started working for a company called interval research which was Justin being founded by David Lidell and Paul Allen has a for-profit research Enterprise in Silicon Valley. I met with David to talk about what I might do in his company I was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business and supporting Myself by being on the speaking circuit and writing books after 20 years or so in the computer game industry having ideas that people didn't think they could sell. and David and I discovered that we had a question in common that we really wanted the answer to and that was why hasn't anybody built in a computer games for little girls. why is that. it can't just be a giant sexist conspiracy you know these people aren't that smart there's there's six billion dollars on the table I know they would go for it if they could figure out how so what is the deal here. and as we thought about our our goals I should say that intervals really a humanistic institution in the classical sense that humanism at its best finds a way to combine. clear-eyed Empirical research with a set of core values that fundamentally love and respect people you know the basic idea of humanism is the improvable quality of life that we can do good things that there are things worth doing because they're good things to do and that clear-eyed empiricism can help us figure out how to do them so contrary to popular belief there is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values and interval research is kind of the living example of how that can be true the David and I decided to go find out through the vest research we can muster what it would take to get a little girl to put her hands on a computer to achieve a level of comfort and ease with the technology that little boys have because they play video games. we spent two and a half years conducting research we spend another year-and-a-half and advanced development then we formed a spin-off company in the research phase of the of the project at Intervale we partnered with a company called chess can research and these people Davis masks and Christopher Ireland change my mind entirely about what market research was and what it could be they taught me how to look and see and they did not do the incredibly stupid thing of saying to a child of all these things we already make you which do you like best you know which gives you 10 answer the twos of all so what we did for the first two and a half years was for things we we did an extensive review of the literature and related fields like cognitive psychology spatial cognition gender studies play Theory sociology primatology thank you friends of all wherever you are I love you and I'd give anything to meet you. after we had done that with a pretty large team of people and discover what we thought that's the Salient issues were with girls and boys and playing because after all that's really what this is about we move to the second phase of our work where we interviewed adult experts in Academia so the people who produce the literature that we found relevant and also we did focus groups of people who are on the ground with kids everyday life playground supervisors talk to them confirm some hypotheses identified some serious questions about gender difference in play. then we did what I consider to be the heart of the work we interviewed 1100 children boys and girls ages 7 to 12 all over the United States except for Silicon Valley Boston an awesome because we know that their little families would have millions of computers in them and they wouldn't be a record in a representative sample. and at the end of those remarkable conversations with kids and their best friends across the United States after two years we pull together some survey data from another 10,000 children Drew up a set of what we thought were the key findings of our research and spend another year transforming them into design heuristics for Designing computer face products and in fact any kind of products for little girls ages 8 to 12 and we spent that time designing interactive computer software and testing them with little girls in 1996 in November we formed the company purple moon which is a spin-off of interval research and our chief investors were interval research Vulcan Northwest institutional Venture partners and Allen & Company. we launched the website on September 2nd that has now served 25 million pages and has forty thousand registered young girl users who spend an average of an average of 1 1/2 times a day spent an average of 35 minutes and visit and look at fifty pages of visit so we feel that we've formed a successful online community with girls we wants two titles in October Rockets new school which is the first of a series of products about a character called Rocket beginning her first day of school in 8th grade in a brand new place with a blank slate which allows girls to play with the question of what will I be like when I'm older what's it going to be like to be in high school or Junior High School who are my friends to exercise that the love of social complexity and the nerd of intelligence that drives most of their play Behavior. and which investment is Delia's about noticing that we have lots of choices in our lives and the way that we conduct ourselves the other tile that we launched just called secret path in the forest that address is 7 fantasy or an inner lives of girls these two titles both showed up in the top 50 entertainment titles and PC data entertainment titles and PC data and December right up there with John Madden football which is it Thrills me to death so we're real and we've we've touched several hundreds of thousands of little girl now then we've half a billion Impressions with marketing and PR for this brand purple moon 96% of them roughly have been positive 4% of them have been other. I want to talk about the other because the politics of this Enterprise in a way have been the most fascinating part of it for me. there are only two kinds of negative reviews that we have received. what kind of Reviewer is a male gamer who thinks he knows what games are to be I won't show the product a little girls. another kind of Reviewer is a certain flavor of feminist who thinks they know what little girls are to be. and so it's funny to me that these interesting odd bedfellows have one thing in common. they don't listen to little girls. they haven't looked at children and they're certainly not demonstrating any love for them. I'd like to play you some voices of little girls from the two-and-a-half years of research that we did actually some of the voices are more recent and these voices will be accompanied by photographs that they took for us of their lives of the things that they value and care about these are pictures the girls themselves never saw that they gave to us. this is the stuff those reviewers don't know about it aren't listening to and this is the kind of research I recommend to you who want to do humanistic work. yeah we have in the very beginning of the whole game always we do this each a piece of paper and write down our name our age are we rich very rich not rich for medium well my boyfriends pets without sisters brothers and all those divorce this is my temporary one we make a school newspaper on my computer. a really pretty scenery with clouds and flowers like if you were going you were really ventures in a real big tomboy you would think that girl skins for kind of sissy. I want track I played soccer I play basketball and I have a lot of things to do and sometimes I feel like they can't really enjoy myself unless it's like a vacation for like my get Mondays and all those days off just all this different stuff that I have to do and sometimes it gets overwhelming my friend Justine. can I pick my friend Kelly and now they're being mean to me well sometimes it's gets annoying when your brothers and sisters are for their sister when they copy you and like you get your idea first and and they just think they take your idea and they do it themselves because my older sister she gets everything and like when I asked my mom for something she'll say no all the time she is my sister everything I want to show you real quickly just a minute of rockets tricky decision which went gold 2 days ago so let's hope it's really stable. but this is the second day in Rockets life and the reason I'm telling you this is that I'm helping at the scene that I'm going to show you well look familiar and sound familiar now that you've listened to some girls voices and you can always try to incorporate the issues that matter to them in the game that we've created. come here. did you hear about an Achilles big Halloween party this weekend she asked me to make sure you knew about it and the killing invited Ruben to but what isn't he coming I don't think so I mean I heard his band is playing at another party the same night really what other party and invited all the best people and we can discuss forward to the decision point because I know I don't have a lot of time after this awful event occurs rocket gets to decide how she feels about her, she was at that party anyway I could get invited to that party anyway if I wanted to G my dad'll make Max's vest people list okay so we're going to emotionally navigate to replying again that's what we do if at any time during a game we want to learn more about the characters we can go into this hit in the hallway. and out quickly just show you the interface we can for example go find Nico's locker and get some more information about her turn the wrong way but you get the general idea of the product I wanted to show you the ways innocuous as they seem and which were incorporating what we've learned about girls and their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility and play around with the social complexity of their lives. I want to make the point that what we're giving girls I think through the saffert is a kind of validation a sense of being seen and a sense of the choices that are available in their lives we love them we see them. we're not trying to tell him who they oughta be but we're really really happy about who they are it turns out they're really great I want to close by showing you a videotape that's a version of a future game in the Rockets series that are graphic artists and design people put together that we feel would please that 4% of reviewers.you know. thanks",0.7994791269302368,
69,BreneBrown_2010X.sph.wav,and it becomes this dangerous cycle one of the things i think we need to think about is why and how we numb and it doesn't just have to be addiction the other thing we do is we make everything that's uncertain just certain the more afraid we are the more vulnerable we are the more afraid we are this is what politics looks like today there's no discourse anymore we if there's anyone who wants their life to look like this it would be me but it doesn't work because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks which just i hope in a hundred years people will look back and they're hardwired for struggle when they get here and when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand our job is not so say look at her she's my job is just to keep her perfect make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and yale by seventh grade job our job is to look and say you know what you're imperfect and you're wired for struggle but you are worthy of love and belonging that's our job show me a generation of kids raised like that and we'll end the problems i think that we see today we pretend whether it's a bailout an oil spill a recall we pretend like what we're doing doesn't have a huge impact on other people i would say to companies this is not our first rodeo people i was a young researcher doctoral student my first year i had a research professor who said to we just need you to be authentic and real and say to let ourselves be seen deeply seen vulnerably seen to love with our whole to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror when we're wondering can i love you this much can i believe in this this passionately can i be this fierce about is to believe that we're enough because when we work from a place i believe that says i 'm enough here 's the thing if you cannot measure it it does not exist and so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed the life 's messy love it and i'm more of the life 's messy clean it up and so to think that i had found my way to found a career that takes me really one of the big sayings in social work is lean into the discomfort of the work and i'm like knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all a 's that was my so i'll start with this a couple years ago an event planner called me because i was going to do a speaking event and she called and she said so i was very excited i thought you know what this is the career for me because i am interested in some messy topics but i want to be able to make them i want to understand them i want to hack into these things i know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see so where i started was with connection because by the time you're a social worker for ten years what you realize is that connection is why we're here it's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives this is what it's all about it doesn't matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice and mental health know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss and she tells you thirty seven things you do really awesome and one thing an opportunity for growth and all you can think about is that opportunity for growth right well apparently this is the way my work went as well because when you ask people about love really struggling with how to write about you on the little flier and i thought well what's the struggle and she said they tell you about heartbreak when you ask people about belonging they'll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded and when you ask people about connection the stories they told me were about disconnection very quickly really about six weeks into this research i ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that i didn't understand or had never seen and so i pulled back out of the research and thought i need to figure out what this is and it turned out to be shame be worthy of connection the things i can tell you about it it's universal we all have it the only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection no one wants to talk about it and the less you talk about it the more you have well i saw you speak and i'm going to call you a researcher i think but i'm afraid if i call you a researcher no one will come because they'll think you're boring what underpinned this shame this i 'm not good enough which we all know that feeling i 'm not blank enough i'm not thin enough rich enough beautiful enough smart enough promoted enough the thing that underpinned this was idea in order for connection to happen we have to allow ourselves to be seen really seen and you know how i feel about vulnerability i hate vulnerability and so i thought this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick i'm going in i'm going to figure this stuff out i'm going to spend a year i'm going to totally deconstruct shame i'm going to understand how vulnerability works and i'm going to outsmart it so i was ready and i was really excited as you know it's not going to turn out well so i could tell you a lot about shame but i'd have to borrow everyone else's time but here 's what i can tell you that it boils down to and this may be one of the most important things that i've ever learned in the decade of doing this research my one year turned into six years thousands of stories hundreds of long interviews focus groups at one point people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories thousands of pieces of data in six years and i kind of got a handle on it i kind of understood this is what shame is this is how it works who really have a sense of worthiness that's what this comes down to a sense of worthiness they have a strong sense of love and belonging okay and she said and folks who struggle for it and folks who are always wondering if their good enough there was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it and that was the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging the thing i liked about your talk is you're a storyteller so i think what i'll do is just call you a storyteller and of course the academic insecure part of me was like and to me the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we're not worthy of connection was something that personally and professionally i felt like i needed to understand better so what i did is i took all of the interviews where i saw worthiness where i saw people living that way and just looked at what do these people have in common i slight office supply addiction but that's another talk so i had a manila folder and i had a sharpie and i was like what am i going to call this research and the first words that came to my mind were whole hearted these are whole hearted people living from this deep sense of worthiness so i wrote at the top of the manila folder and i started looking at the data in fact i did it first in a four day my husband left town with the kids meaning heart and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart and so these folks had very simply the courage to be imperfect they had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others because as it turns out and she said i 'm going to call you a storyteller and i was like we can't practice compassion with other people if we can't treat ourselves kindly and the last was they had connection and this was the hard part as a result of authenticity they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were to absolutely do that for connection the other thing that they had in common was fully embraced vulnerability they believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful they didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable nor did they talk about it being excruciating as i had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing they just talked about it being necessary they talked about the willingness to say i love you first the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out they thought this was fundamental i personally thought it was betrayal i could not believe i had pledged allegiance to research let me think about this for a second i tried to call deep on my courage and now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability sounds better than breakdown but i assure you it was a breakdown i thought i am a storyteller i'm a qualitative researcher i collect stories and they're like i 'm just saying you know don't bring your measuring stick i brought in my list of the way the whole hearted live and i sat down and she said how are you i'm okay she said what 's going on and this is a therapist because we have to go to those because their b s meters are and so i said here 's the thing i do and maybe stories are just data with a soul and maybe i'm just a storyteller and so i said you know what of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness but it appears that it's also the birthplace of joy of creativity of belonging of love and i think i have a problem and i need some help and i said but here 's the thing no family stuff no childhood shit i just neither good nor bad and it did and it didn 't and it took about a year and you know how there are people that when they realize that's not me and b i don't even hang out with people like say i'm a researcher storyteller for me pushed i pushed back i lost the fight but probably won my life back and so then i went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they the whole hearted what choices they were making and what are we doing with vulnerability why do we struggle with it so much am i alone in struggling with vulnerability so this is what i learned we numb vulnerability we're waiting for the call it was funny i sent something out on twitter and on facebook that says how would you define vulnerability what makes you feel vulnerable and within an hour and a half i had a one hundred and fifty responses because i wanted to know what's out there being turned down asking someone i'm a researcher storyteller and i'm going to talk to you today we're talking about expanding perception and so i want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research we live in a vulnerable world and one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability and i think there's evidence and it's not the only reason this evidence exists but i think it's a huge cause we are the most in debt addicted and medicated adult cohort in u s history the problem is and i learned this from the research that you cannot selectively numb you can't say here 's the bad here 's vulnerability here 's grief here 's shame here 's fear here 's disappointment i don't want to feel these i'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin i don't want to feel these and i know that's knowing laughter i hack into your lives for a living god you can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the affects our emotions you cannot selectively numb so when we numb those we numb joy we numb gratitude we numb happiness and we are miserable and we are looking for purpose and meaning and then we feel vulnerable so then we have a couple of,1,"so I'll start with this a couple years ago an event planner called me cuz I was going to do a speaking event and she called and she said I'm really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer and I thought well what's the struggle and she said well I saw you speak and I'm going to call you a researcher I think that I'm afraid if I call you a researcher no one will, because they'll think you're boring and irrelevant. And I said Okay and she said so but the thing I liked about your talk as you know you're a Storyteller so I think what I'll do is just call you a Storyteller and of course the academic insecure part of me was like you're going to call me or what and she said I'm going to call you a Storyteller and I was like why not. I I don't let me think about this for a second so I tried to call Deepa my courage and I thought you know I have a story to tell her I'm a qualitative researcher I collect story that's what I do and maybe stories are just data with a soul you know and maybe I'm just a Storyteller so I said you know what why don't you just say I'm a researcher Storyteller and she went. there's no such thing. so I'm a researcher Storyteller and I'm going to talk to you today we're talking about expanding perception and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually change the way that I live and love and work and parent and this is where my story starts when I was a young researcher student my first year I had a research Professor who said to us here's the thing if you cannot measure it it does not exist. I thought he was just sweet talking to me I was like really and he's like absolutely we have to understand that I have a Bachelors in Social Work masters in social work and I was getting my PHD in social work to her academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the life of Messi. love it. you know and I'm more of the life's messy clean it up. organize it and put it into a Bento Box. and so to think I had found my way to found a career that takes me and I really one of the big sayings and in social work is lean into the discomfort of the work and I'm like you know not discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all A's that's my that was my mantra. so I was very excited about that and so I thought you know what this is a queer for me because I am interested in some messy topics but I want to be able to make them not messy I want to understand them I want to hack into these things that I know are important and Leda code out for everyone to see so where I started was with connection because by the time your social worker for 10 years what you realize is that connection is why we're here it's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives. this is this is what it's all about it doesn't matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice and mental health and abuse and neglect what we know is that connection the ability to feel connected. is neural biologically that's how we're wired it's why we're here so I thought you know what I'm going to start with connection. we know that that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss and she tells you 37 things that you do really awesome and one thing that you can't do an opportunity for growth. and all you can think about is that opportunity for growth right well apparently this is the way my work went as well because when you ask people about love they tell you about heartbreak when you ask people about belonging they'll tell you the most excruciating experiences of being excluded and when you ask people about connection the stories they told me were about disconnection. it's a very quickly really about six weeks into this research I ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection. in a way that I didn't understand or had never seen and so I pulled back out of the research and thought I need to figure out what this is and it turned out to be shame. and Shane is really easily understood as a fear of disconnection is there something about me that if other people know it or see it that I won't be worthy of connection the things I can tell you about it it's Universal we all have it the only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection no one wants to talk about it and unless you talk about it the more you have it. what underpinned this shame this I'm not good enough which we all know that feeling I'm not going to enough I'm not sending that fortunate beautiful not smart enough promoted enough I think that underpinned us was excruciating vulnerability this idea of an order for connection to happen we have to allow ourselves to be really seen. and you know how I feel about vulnerability I hate boner ability and so I thought this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick I'm going in I'm going to figure this stuff out I'm going to spend a year I'm going to totally deconstruct shame I'm going to understand how vulnerable he work and I'm going to outsmart it. thought I was ready and I was really excited. as you know it's not going to turn out well. you got to go so I can tell you a lot about shame but I have to borrow everyone else's time but here's what I can tell you that it boils down to and this may be one of the most important things that I've ever learned in the decade of doing this research. my 1 years turned into 6 years. thousands of stories hundreds of long interviews focus groups at one point people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories thousands of pieces of data and six years and I kind of got a handle on it I kind of understood this is what shame is this is how it works. I read a book I published a theory but something was not okay and what it was is that if I roughly took the people I interviewed and divided them into people. who really have a sense of worthiness that's what this comes down to it since the poor thing is they have a strong sense of love and belonging and folks who struggle for it and folks who are always wondering if they're good enough there was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it and that was the people who have a strong sense of belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging. they believed there were they. and to me the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we're not worthy of connection. with something that personally and professionally I felt like I needed to understand better. so what I did. is I took all of the interviews where I saw Worthing us where I saw people living that way and just looked at those what do these people have in common and I have I have a slight office supply addiction but it's another talk so I had a manila notebook manila folder and I had a Sharpie and I was like what am I going to call this research in the first words that came to my mind we're wholehearted. he's our kind of hole hearted people living from this deep sense of worthiness I rode the top of the manila folder. and I started looking at the data in fact I did it first and it's very full and afford a very intensive data analysis why I went back for these interviews pull the story pulled it into that's what's what's what's the pattern. my husband left town with the kids because I always go into this kind of Jackson Pollock crazy thing where I just like riding and then going in kind of just in my researcher mode. and so here's what I found. what they had in common was a sense of courage and I wanted separate courage and bravery for you for a minute Courage the original definition of courage when it first came as the English language is from the Latin word Cur any heart and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart. it's of these folks had very simply the courage to be imperfect. they had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then two others because as it turns out we can't practice compassion with other people if we can't treat ourselves kindly and the last was they had a connection and this was a hard part as a result of authenticity. they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were which is you have to absolutely do that for connection. the other thing that they had in common. was that. they fully Embrace vulnerability. they. believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful. they didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable nor did they really talk about it being excruciating as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing they just talked about it being necessary. they talked about the willingness to say I love you first. the willingness to. do something where there are no guarantees. the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram. they're willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out. they thought this was fundamental. I personally thought it was betrayal I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research. where are job here the definition of research is to control control and predict to study phenomenon for the reason for the explicit reason to control and predict and now my very my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live as with all nobility and to stop controlling and predicting this led to. a little break down. which actually looks more like that and it did it led to a I caught a break down my therapist called in a spiritual awakening. if you're selecting sounds better than breakdown but I assure you it was a breakdown and I had to put my date away and go find a therapist let me tell you something you know who you are when you call your friends and say I think I need to see somebody do you have any recommendations. good about 5 my friends like I wouldn't want to be your therapist. you know I am just saying you don't like don't bring your measuring stick. okay. so I found a therapist my first meeting with her Diana. I brought in my list of the way the wholehearted live and I sat down and she said you know how are you and I said I'm great I'm okay she said what's going on and I said it is a therapist to see therapist because we have to go to those because they're BS M are good. and so I said here's the thing I'm struggling and she's about to struggle and I said well. I have a vulnerability issue and you know and I know that vulnerability is kind of decor. a shame and fear in our struggle for worthiness but it appears that it's also the birthplace of joy of creativity a belonging of love and I I think I have a problem and I just I need some help and I said but here's the thing no family stuff no childhood shit I just. I just need some strategy. thank you. there she goes like this. and then I said it's bad right and she said it's neither good nor bad it just is what it is and I said oh my God this is going. and it did and it didn't and it took about a year and you know how there are people that like when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness or important that they kind of surrender and walk into it. a that's not me and be I don't even hang out with people like that. for me it was a year-long street fight. there was a slugfest phone really pushed I pushed back I lost the fight but probably want my life back and so then I went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they the wholehearted what the choices they were making it and what what is what what are we doing with our Mobility why do we struggle with it too much am I alone in struggling with vulnerability. no so this is what I learned. we numb vulnerability. when we're waiting for the call it was funny I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook that says how would you define vulnerability what makes you feel vulnerable and within an hour and a half I had 150 responses cuz I wanted to know do you know what what's out there. having to ask my husband for help cuz I'm sick and we're newly married initiating sex with my husband and initiating sex with my wife. being turned down asking someone out waiting for the doctor to call back getting laid off laying off people this is the world we live in. we live in a vulnerable world and one of the ways we deal with it as we known vulnerability and I think there's evidence and it's not the only reason this evidence exists but I think that there is a huge cock we are. the most in debt. obese. addicted and medicated adult cohort in US history. the problem is and I learned this from the research that you cannot selectively numb emotion you can't say here's the bad stuff here is vulnerability here's grief here Shane here's fear here's disappointment I don't want to feel these I'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. I don't want to feel these and I know that's what I know that's knowing laughter I hack into your lives for a living I know that God. you can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other effects are emotions you cannot possibly know so when we know um those we Nam gioi. we not gratitude we Nam happiness. and then we are miserable and we are looking for purpose and meaning and then we feel vulnerable so then we have a couple of beers in a banana nut muffin. and it becomes dangerous cycle. one of the things that I think that we need to think about is why and how we numb and it doesn't just have to be a diction. the other thing we do is we make everything is uncertain certain. religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty I'm right you're wrong shut up. jesser. the more afraid we are the more vulnerable you are the more afraid we are this is what politics looks like today there's no discourse anymore there's no conversation there's just blame blame as described in the research. a way to discharge pain and discomfort. we perfect if there's anyone who wants their life to look like this it would be me but it doesn't work because what we do is we take fat from your butt and put it in our cheeks. which death I hope in 100 years people will look back and go. ugh and we perfect most dangerously our children let me tell you what we think about children they're hardwired for struggle when they get here when you stole those perfect little babies in your hand our job is not to say look at her she's perfect my job is just to keep her perfect mixture to make the tennis team by fifth grade and yell by seventh grade. that's on her job our job is to look and say you know what you're imperfect and you're wired for struggle but you are worthy of love and belonging. that's our job show me a generation of kids raised like that and will in the problem so I think that we see today we pretend. that what we do doesn't have an effect on people. we do that in our personal lives we do that corporate whether it's a bailout and oil spill. Are We call we pretend like what we're doing does it have a huge impact on other people. I would say the company this is not our first rodeo people. we just need you to be authentic and real and say. we're sorry we'll fix it. but there's another way and I'll leave you with this this is what I found to let ourselves be seen. deeply sing sing. to love with her whole heart even though there's no guarantee and that's really hard and I can tell you as a parent that's excruciating Lee difficult. to practice gratitude and joy and those moments of kind of Terror when we're wondering can I love you this much can I believe in this is passionately can I be this Fierce about this just to be able to stop in instead of catastrophizing what might happen to say I'm just so grateful. because I feel vulnerable means I'm alive. and the last which I think is probably the most important. it's a believe that were enough. because when we work from a place I believe that says I'm a mess. then we stop screaming and start listening. what kind of Enchantment of the people around us and we're Kinder and gentler to ourselves. that's all I have. sure that's video on the Human net worth Cisco welcome to the human Network",0.71484375,
70,BrewsterKahle_2007P.sph.wav,now a lot of these materials so we've got about one hundred thousand pieces up there so and all of the pages on it every two months and actually it's really been pioneered by alexa internet which donates this collection to the internet archive and it's been growing along for the last eleven years and it's a fantastic resource and we've made a way back machine that you can then go and see old of everything ever published everything that was ever meant for distribution available to anybody in the world that's ever wanted to have access to it kind of the way they were if you go and search on something this is google com the different versions of it that we have this is what it looks like when it was an alpha release and this is what it looked like at stanford so anyway you've got basically an idea of where things came from mostly people want to see their old stuff out of this if there's one thing that we want to learn from the library of alexandria version one which is probably best known for burning is don't just have one copy so we've started to we've made another copy of all of this and we actually put it back in the flood zone in amsterdam and in the middle east right so anyway so we're hedging our bets here if we go and put it in a couple more places i think we'll be in good shape there's a political and social question out of this is all of this as we go digital is it going to be public or private there's some large companies that have seen this vision that are doing large scale digitization but they're locking up the public domain the question is is that the world that we really want to live in what's the role of the public versus the private as things go forward how do we go and have a world where we both have libraries and publishing in the future just as we basically benefited as we were growing up so universal access to all knowledge i think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind like the man on the moon or the gutenberg bible or the library of alexandria it could be something that we're remembered for for millennia for having achieved yes there's issues about how money should be distributed and that's still being refigured out but i'd say there's plenty of money and there's plenty of demand so we can actually achieve that and as i said before i'll end with something that's carved above the door of the carnegie library carnegie one of the great capitalists of this country carved above his legacy free to the people thank you very much i'm going to go over the technological social and sort of where are we as a whole trying to get to that particular vision and the way i'm going to try to do this is do it like the amazon com website the books music video and just go step media type by media type just go and say all right how we doing on this so if we start with books where are we well first you have to as an engineer scope the problem how big is it if you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available well how big a problem is it well we don't really know but the largest print library in the world is the library of congress it's twenty six million volumes twenty six million volumes it's by far and away the largest print library in the world and a book if you had a book we really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children is about a megabyte so you know if you had it in microsoft word so a megabyte twenty six million megabytes is twenty six terabytes it goes mega so for the cost of a house or around here a garage you can put you can have spinning all of the words in the library of congress that's pretty neat then the question is what do you get you know is it worth trying to get there do you actually want it online some of the first things that people do is if we don't do that we're going to get the generation we deserve they make book readers that allow you to search inside the books and that's kind of fun and you can download these things and look around them in new and different ways and you can get at them remotely if you happen to have a laptop there's starting to be some of these sort of page turn ee interfaces that look a whole lot like books in certain ways and you can search them make little tabs and it's kind of cute still very book like on your laptop but i don't know reading things on a laptop whenever i pull up my laptop it always feels like work i think that's one of the reasons why the kindle is so great i don't have to feel like i'm at work to read a kindle it's starting to be a little bit more specified but i have to say that there's older technologies that i tend to like i like the physical book and i think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things put them on the net and then download print them and bind them and end up with books again and we sort of said well how hard is this and it turns out to not be very hard we actually went off to make a bookmobile and a bookmobile the size of a van with a satellite dish a printer binder and cutter and kids make their own books it costs about three dollars to download print and bind a normal old book and they actually come out kind of nice looking you can actually get really good looking books for on the order of one penny per page sort of the parts cost for doing this so the idea of this technology actually may end up putting books back in people 's hands again there are some other bookmobiles running around this is eric eldred making books at walden pond thoreau 's works this is just before he got kicked out by the parks for competing with the bookstore there in india they've got another couple bookmobiles running around and this is the opening day at the library of alexandria the new library of alexandria in egypt the elite parents librarians professionals whatever it is a bunch of our activities are in fact in trying to get the best we have to offer within reach was quite popularly attended and kids starting to make their own books and a happy kid with the first book that he 's ever so the idea of being able to use this technology to end up with paper where i can handle sort of sounds a little retro but i think it still has its place and being sort of from the silicon valley sort of utopia and sort of you know world we thought if we can make this technology work in rural uganda we might have something so we actually got some funding from the world bank to try it out and we found in about thirty days we could go and take a couple folks from so the books were in the library we could get it to people if they're digitized but we didn't know how to quite get them digitized everybody thought the answer is send things to india and china and so we've tried that and i'll go over that in a moment there are some newer technologies for delivering that have happened are actually quite exciting as well one is a print on demand machine that looks like a rube goldberg machine we have one of these things now it's completely cool it's all conveyor belt and it makes a and it's called the espresso book machine and in about ten minutes you can press a button and make a book something else i'm quite excited about in this particular domain of those around us or as broadly as we can i'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone one is what's on the boston public library carved above their door is free to all beyond these sort of kiosky things where you can get books on demand is some of these new little and one of my favorites in this is the one hundred dollar laptop and i don't mean to steal any thunder here but we've gone and used one of these things to be an e book reader so here 's one of the units and you can it actually turns out to be a really good looking e book reader and we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it and it turns out that two hundred dots per inch means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good at two hundred dots per inch it's kind of the equivalent of a three hundred dot print laser printer we're in good enough shape you actually can go and read scanned books quite easily so the idea of electronic books is starting to come about but how do you do all this scanning so we thought okay well let 's try out this send books to india thing and there was a project with funded by the national science foundation sent a bunch of scanners and the american libraries were supposed to send books well they didn't they didn't want to send their books so we bought one hundred thousand books and sent them to india and then we learned why you don't want to send books to india the lesson we learned out of this is scan your own books if you really care about books you're going to scan them better especially if they're valuable books if they're new books and you can just you know butcher them because you could just buy another one that's not such a big deal in terms of doing high quality scanning but do things that you love but the indians have been scanning a lot of their own books about three hundred thousand now doing very well the chinese did over a million and the egyptians are about thirty thousand but we sent thought ok if we're going to need to do this let 's do it in library how do we go and do this and how do we get it down so that it's a cost point that we could afford and we sort of picked the price point of ten cents a page if it's basically the cost of xeroxing kind of an inspiring statement and i'll go back at the end of this i'm a librarian and what i'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge to digitize ocr package it up make it so that you could download print and bind it the whole shebang we would have achieved something so we started out trying to figure out how do we get to ten cents and we tried these robot things and they worked pretty well sort of these auto page turning things if we can have mars rovers think you could turn pages but it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages and the volume isn't there so anyway so we ended up making our own book scanner and with two digital high grade professional digital cameras controlled museum lighting so even if it's a black and white book you can go and get the proper intonation so you basically do a beautiful respectful job this is not a fax this is the idea is to do a beautiful job as you're going through these libraries and we've been able to achieve ten cents a page if we run things in volumes this is what it looks like at the university of toronto and actually it turns out to you know pay a living wage people seem to love it yes it's a little boring but some people kind of get into the zen of it and especially if it's kind of interesting books that you care about in languages that you can read we actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this at getting ten cents a page so ten cents a page three hundred pages in your average book thirty dollars a book the library of congress if you did the whole darn thing twenty six million books is about seven hundred and fifty million dollars to as many people as want to read it and the idea of using technology is perfect for us i think we have the opportunity to one up the greeks but a million books i think actually would be a pretty good start and that would cost thirty million dollars that's not that big a bill and what we've been able to do is get into libraries we've now got eight of these scanning centers in three countries and libraries are up for having their books scanned the getty here is moving their books to the ucla which is where we have one these scanning centers and scanning their out of copyright books which is fabulous so we're starting to get the institutional responsibility the thing we're missing is the ten cents if we can get the ten cents all the rest of it flows we've scanned about two hundred thousand books now we're scanning about fifteen thousand books a month and it's starting to gear up another factor of two from there so all in all that's going very well and we're starting to move out of the just out of copyright into the out of print world so i think of we're kind of going from the out of copyright library stuff and amazon com is coming from the in print world and i think we'll meet in the middle some place and have the classic thing that you have which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel and so we're starting up a program to do out of print works but loaning them what loaning means i'm not quite sure but anyway loaning out of print works from the boston public library the woods hole oceanographic institute and a few other libraries that are starting to participate in this program to try out this model of where does a library stop and where does the bookstore take over so all in all it's possible to do this in large scale we're also going back over microfilm and getting that online so we can do ten cents a page we're going fifteen thousand books a month and we've got about two hundred and fifty thousand books online counting all the other projects that are starting to add in so what i wanted to argue is books are within our grasp the idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal yes it costs tens of millions low hundreds of millions but one time shot and we've got basically the history of printed literature online and then there's business model issues about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people but it is within our grasp technologically and law wise at least for the out of print and out of copyright we suggest to be able to get the whole darn thing online now let 's go for audio and i'm going to go through these so how much is there well as best we can tell there are about two to three million disks having been published so seventy eight s long playing records and cds or at least that's the largest archives of published materials we've been able to sort of point at it costs about ten dollars a piece to go and take a disk and put it online if you're doing things in volume and we've been starting to make these available by going and offering shelf space on the net in the united states it doesn't cost you to give something away problem was you actually had to go to alexandria to go to it on other hand if you did then great things happened i think we can one up the greeks right if you give something to a charity or to the public you get a pat on the back and a tax donation except on the net can go broke if you put up a video of your garage band and it starts getting heavily accessed you can lose your guitars or your house this doesn't make any sense so we've offered unlimited storage unlimited bandwidth forever for free bands a day signing up they give permission and we get about forty or fifty concerts a day we have about forty thousand concerts everything the grateful dead ever did up on the net so that people can see it and listen to this material so audio is possible to put up but the rights issues are really pretty thorny we've got a lot of collections now a couple hundred thousand items and it's growing over time that are really meant for a large scale theatrical distribution it's just not that many but half of those were indian but anyway it's doable but we've only found about a thousand of these things that to be and achieve something and i'm going to try to argue only one point today that universal access to all knowledge out of copyright so we've digitized those and made those available but we've found that there's lots of other types of movies that haven't really seen the light of day archival films we've found also a lot of political films a lot of amateur films all sorts of things that are basically needing of a home a permanent home so we've been starting to make these available and it's grown to be very which has just been great fun television comes quite a bit larger we started recording twenty channels of television twenty four hours a day sort of the biggest tivo box you've ever seen it's about a petabyte so far of worldwide television mostly for cost reasons which is the nine eleven sort of from nine eleven two thousand and one for one week what did the world see is within our grasp so if i'm successful then you'll actually come away thinking yeah we could actually achieve the great vision cnn were saying that palestinians were dancing in the streets were they let 's look at the palestinian television and find out how can we have,1,"we really need to put the best we have to offer Within Reach of our children if we don't do that we're going to get the generation we deserve they're going to learn from what it is they have around and we as now delete parents and professionals whatever it is a bunch of our activities are in fact and trying to get the best we have to offer Within Reach of those around us are as broadly as we can I am going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone when is what's on the Boston Public Library carved above the door is free to all kind of an inspiring statement and I'll go back at the end of this I'm a librarian and what I'm trying to do is bring all of the works knowledge to as many people as want to read it and the idea of using technology is perfect for us I think we have the opportunity to one-up the Greeks not easy to want up the Greeks. with the industriousness of the Egyptians are able to build a Library of Alexandria the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world from was you actually had to go to Alexandria to go to it if you did think great things happened I think we can one up the Greeks and Achieve something and I'm going to try to argue only one point today that universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp so if I'm successful didn't actually come with me yeah we can actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published everything that was ever meant for distribution available to anybody in the world that's ever wanted to have access to it yes there's a issues about how many should be distributed and that's still being re figured out but I'd say that's plenty of money and it's plenty of demand so we can actually achieve that, but I'm going to go over the technological social entered where we where are we as a hole trying to get to that particular Vision in the way I. try to do this is do it like the amazon.com website the books music video and it just goes step media type by media type to go and say all right how we doing on stuff we start with books where where are we as an engineer scope the problem how big is it if you wanted to put all of the published works and online it said anybody can have that available what how big a problem is it when we don't really know what the largest library in the world is the Library of Congress is 26 million volumes 26 million times is by far and away the large print library in the world and a book if you had a book is about a megabyte so you know if you had in Microsoft Word so MB 26 million MB is 26 terabytes does mega Giga Tera in 26 terabyte 26 terabytes fit in a computer system that's about this big on spinning and spinning Lenox Drive and it cost about 60,000. so for the cost of a house or around here garage you can put you can have spinning all of the words in the Library of Congress that's pretty neat and the question is what do you get if you know is it worth trying to get there do you actually want it online some of the first things people do what they do they make book readers that allow you to search inside the books and that's kind of fun and you can download these things and look around them and in new and different ways and you can get at them remotely if you happen to have a laptop they're starting to be some of these sort of Paige Kearney interfaces that look a whole lot like books in certain ways to conserve to make little pads and it's kind of cute still very book like on your laptop but I don't know you really think I'm a laptop when I pull up my laptop it always feels like work I think that's one of the reasons why the Kindle is so great I don't have to feel like I'm at work to read a Kindle it's starting to be a little bit more specific specify what I have to say that there. there's older technologies that I tend to like I like the physical book and I think we can go in use our technology to go and digitize things put them on the net and then download print them and bind them in the end up with books again and wood source that will how hard is this and it turned out to not be very hard we actually went off to make a bookmobile bookmobile the size of a van with a satellite dish a printer binder and cutter and kids make their own books it cost about $3 to download print and bind a normal old book and they actually come out kind of nice looking actually get really good-looking books for on the order of one penny per page so the parts cost for doing this so the idea that technology actually may end up putting book back in people's hands again there's some other bookmobiles running around this is Eric Eldred making books at Walden Pond the rose work this is just before he got kicked out by the park service for competing with the book store there. India they've got another couple bookmobiles running around and this is the opening day at the Library of Alexandria the new Library of Alexandria in Egypt was quite popular Aaliyah attend attend kids starting to make their own books and a happy kid with the first book that he's ever owned so the idea of being able to use this technology to end up with paper back and hands sort of sounds a little retro but I think of that it still has its place and being soda from the Silicon Valley sort of utopian sort of you know if we can make this technology Uganda we might have had that we might have something to actually got some funding from the World Bank to try it out and we found in about 30 days we could go and take a couple folks from from Silicon Valley flies I'm to Uganda by a carb set up at the first internet connection at the National Library of Uganda I'll figure out what they wanted and get a program going making books in rural Uganda and actually the technologically. we found out of this we didn't have the right books. so the books are in the library we could get it to people if they are digitized but we didn't know how to track a digitized everybody thought the answer is 10 things to India and China until we've tried that and I'll go over that in the moment there's some newer Technologies for delivering that have happened that are actually quite exciting as well one is a print-on-demand machine that looks like a Rube Goldberg machine we have one of these things now it's completely cool it is it in the whole conveyor belt and it makes a book and it's a call the expresso book machine in about 10 minutes you can press a button it and make a book something else I'm quite excited about in this particular domain Beyond these sort of kioski things where you can get books on demand is some of these new little screens that are coming out in one of my favorites and this is $200 laptop and I don't mean to to to steal any Thunder here but we've gone and used. these things to be an e-book reader so here's one of the beta units and you can it's actually turned out to be a really good looking. eBook reader. and we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it and it turns out the 200 dots per inch means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good at $200 per and just kind of the equivalent of 300 laser printer weren't good enough shape you actually can go and read scanned books are quite easily so the idea of electronic books is starting to come about it but how do you go about doing all the scanning so we thought okay well let's try out this send books to India thing and there's a project with funded by the National Science Foundation and sent about the scanners and American laborers were supposed to send books well he didn't they didn't want to send their books so we bought a hundred thousand bucks and sent them to India I know we learned why you don't want to send books to India out of this is scan your own books if you really care about books you're going to scan them better especially if they're valuable books if they're new books you could just you know butcher them because you could just buy another one that's not such a big deal. turn to doing high-quality scanning but do things that you love but the Indians have been scanning a lot of their own books about 300,000 now doing very well the Chinese dude over a million in the Egyptians are about thirty thousand but we thought okay if we're going to need to do this let's do it in library how do we go and do this and how do we get it down to the cost point that we could afford and we sort put pick the price point of 10 centipede if it's basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize OCR package it up make it so that you could download print find it the whole shebang we would have achieved something so we started out trying to figure out how do we get the $0.10 and we try these robot things and they work pretty well sort of these AutoPage turn things if we can have Mars rovers you think you could turn pages but it actually turned out to be pretty hard to turn pages and the volume isn't there so anyway so we ended up making our own book scanner. and all with two digital high-grade professional digital cameras control Museum lighting so even if it's a black and white book you can go and get the proper intonation so you basically do as a beautiful respectful job this is not a fact this is so the idea is to do a beautiful job at as you're going through these libraries and we've been able to achieve ten cents a page if we run things in volume this is what it looks like at the University of Toronto and actually turned out to pay a living wage people seem to love it yes it's a little boring but some people kind of get into this den of it and especially if it's kind of interesting books that you care about in languages that you can read we actually have been able to do a pretty good job of that I getting ten cents to 10 cents a page three hundred pages in your average book $30 a book. the Library of Congress if you did the whole darn thing 26 million books about 750 million dollars but a million books I think I actually would be a pretty good start and I would cost 30 million-dollar that's not that big a bill and what we've been able to do is get into Library we've now got a disease scanning centers are in three countries and libraries are up for having their books can spaghetti here is moving their books to the UCLA which is where we have one of these scanning Center and scanning they're out of copyright bucks which is fabulous so we're starting to get the institutional responsibilities thing we're missing is the $0.10 if we can get the $0.10 has all the rest of it flows we've scanned about 200,000 books now we're scanning about fifteen thousand bucks a month and it's starting to to gear up another factor of two from there to all in all that's going very well and we're starting to move out or just the out of copyright into. out-of-print world so I think we're kind of going from the outer copyright Library stuff and amazon.com is coming from the imprint world and I think we'll meet in the middle someplace and have the classic thing you have which is a publishing system in a library system working in parallel and so we're starting up a program to do out of print work but loaning them winning means not quite sure what do you write loaning out of print works from the Boston Public Library the Woods Hole oceanographic Institute and a few other libraries that are starting to participate in this program to try out this model of where does a library stop and where does the bookstore take over so all in all it's possible to do this and large-scale we're also going back over microfilm and getting that online so we can do 10 cents a page we're going fifteen thousand bucks a month and we've got about two hundred fifty thousand bucks online counting all the other projects. starting to add in so what I wanted to argue is books are within our grasp the idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal yes it cost tens of millions low hundreds of millions but one time shot and we've got basically the history of printed literature online and then there's business model issues about how to try to effectively market and get it get it to people but it is within our grasp technologically and law wise at least for the out of print and out of copyright we suggest she be able to get the whole darn thing online for audio going to go through these so how much it how much is there as best we can tell they're about 2 to 3 million discs having been published Soul 78 long-playing records and send and CDs at least has the largest Archives of published materials we've been able to sort of point at it cost about $10 a piece. go and take a desk and and put it online if you're doing things in volume right tissues are really quite thorny this is a fairly heavily litigated area so we found that there are niches in the music world that aren't serve terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system and where we've been starting to make these available by going and offering shelf space on the net in the United States it doesn't cost you to give something away you give somebody to a charity or to the public you get a pat on the back and attack donation we can go broke if you're if you put up a video of your garage band and it starts getting I have the access you can lose your guitar as well your house this doesn't make any sense so we've offered unlimited storage unlimited bandwidth forever for free. to anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library and we've been getting a lot of takers one is the rock and rollers the rock and rollers had a tradition of sharing as long as nobody made any money you could concert recording not the commercial carti concert recording started by The Grateful Dead and we get about two or three banded a signing up they give permission and and we got about 40 or 50 concert today we have about 40,000 concert everything The Grateful Dead ever did up on them on the net so that people can see it and listen to this materials so audio is possible to put up but the rights issues are really pretty thorny we've got a lot of collections now couple hundred thousand items and it's growing over time moving images if you think of theatrical releases are not that many of them as best we can tell they're about 150,000 to 200000 movies ever that are really meant for a large-scale theatrical distribution it's just not that many about half of those randian but anyways it's it's. but we've only found about a thousand of these things that to be out of copyright to a digitized those and made those available but we found that there's lots of other types of movies that haven't really seen the light of day archival films we found also a lot of political films lot of amateur films all sorts of things that are are basically needing of a home a permanent home so we've been starting to make these available and it's going to be very popular we're not quite a YouTube We tended towards longer-term things and also things that people can reuse and make it to new movies which has been but just been great fun on television come quite a bit larger we started recording 20 Channel's of Television 24 hours a day. It sort of the biggest TiVo box you've ever seen it's about a petabyte so far of worldwide television Russian Chinese Japanese or rocky Al Jazeera BBC CNN ABC CBS NBC 24 hours a day we put only put one week up which is mostly for car. reasons which is the 911 Terror from 9-11-2001 for 1 week what did the world c c n n was saying the Palestinians were dancing in the streets where they both look at the Palestinian television and find out how can we have critical thinking without being able to quote and being able to compare what happened in the past and television is dreadfully unrecorded and uncomfortable except by Jon Stewart who does a fabulous job so anyway television is I would suggest within our grasp so $15 per video hour and also about a hundred $150 per Celluloid hour we're able to go and get materials online very inexpensively and have them up on the net and we've gotten a lot of these materials so I've got about a hundred thousand pieces up there so booked music video software there's only 50,000 titles of it the most of the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy protections. but we work through some of those but we've still got real problems in Washington or best known as the World Wide Web we've been archived in the world wide web since 1996 we take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it every two months and actually it's really been pioneered by Alexa internet which donates this collection to the internet archive and it's been growing along for the last 11 years and it's a fantastic resource and we made a way back machine that you can go and see old website kind of the way they were if you go and search on something this is Google., the different versions of it that we have this is what it looks like when I was an alpha release and this is what it look like it's tampered so anyway you've got a basically an idea of where things came from Mostly people want to see their old stuff out of this if there's one thing that we want to learn from the Library of Alexandria version one which is probably best known for. Burnin it is don't just have one copy so we've started to another copy of all of this and we actually put it back in the Library of Alexandria so this is a picture of the internet archive at the Library of Alexandria and we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam so if we put it on the San Andreas fault line in San Francisco flood zone in Amsterdam and in the Middle East right. So anyway are bats here a couple more places I think we'll be in good good shape to the political and social question out of this is all of this as we go digital is it going to be public or private there's a large companies that have seen this Vision that are doing large-scale digitization but they're locking up the public domain the question is is is that the world that we really want to live in what's the role of the public and versus the private as things go forward how do we go and have a world where we both have libraries and Pub. in the future just as we basically benefited as we were growing up the universal access to all knowledge I think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind like the man on the moon are the Gutenberg Bible or the Library of Alexandria it could be something that were remembered for for Millennia for having achieved and as I said before I Thailand with something it's carved above the door of the Carnegie Library Carnegie one of the great capitalist of this country carved above his legacy free to the people thank you very much",0.8098958730697632,
71,BrianCox_2008.sph.wav,building the last piece of atlas so as of today it's finished i'd like to say that i planned that for ted but i didn 't so it's been completed as of today wonderful achievement so you might be asking why why create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began the hundred billion suns in our galaxy and the hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe absolutely everything now you might say well ok but why not just look at it you know if you want to know what i'm made of let 's look at me well we found that as you look back in time the universe gets hotter and hotter denser and denser and simpler and simpler now there's no real reason i'm aware of for that but that seems to be the case this is the large hadron collider it's twenty seven kilometers in circumference it's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted so way back in the early times of the universe we believe it was very simple and understandable all this complexity all the way to these wonderful things human brains are a property of an old and cold and complicated universe back at the start in the first billionth of a second we believe or we've observed it was very simple but as you heat it up it'll melt into a pool of water and you would be able to see that actually it was just made of h twenty water in that same sense that we look back in time to understand what the universe is made of and as of today it's made of these things just twelve particles of matter stuck together by four forces of nature the quarks these pink things are the things that make up protons and neutrons that make up the atomic nuclei in your body the electron the thing that goes around the atomic nucleus held around in orbit by the way by the electromagnetic force that's carried by this thing the photon the quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons and these guys here they're the weak nuclear force probably the least familiar but without it the sun wouldn't shine ten thousand physicists and engineers from eighty five countries around the world have come together over several decades to build this machine up the road relative to the universe it's just up the road so this thing was discovered in the year two thousand so it's a relatively recent picture one of the wonderful things actually i find is that we've discovered any of them when you realize how tiny a step in size from the entire observable universe so one hundred billion galaxies thirteen point seven billion light years away a step in size from that to monterey actually is about the same as from monterey to these things absolutely exquisitely minute and yet we've discovered so one of my most illustrious forebears at manchester university ernest rutherford discoverer of the atomic nucleus once said all science is either physics or stamp collecting what we do is we accelerate protons so hydrogen nuclei around ninety nine point nine nine nine nine nine nine percent the speed of light i don't think he meant to insult the rest of science although he was from new zealand so it's possible what he was that what we've done really is stamp collect there ok we've discovered the particles but unless you understand the underlying reason for that pattern you know why it's built the way it is really you've done stamp collecting you haven't done science fortunately we have this is a little disingenuous because i've expanded it out in all it's gory detail this equation though allows you to calculate everything other than gravity that happens in the universe so you want to know why the sky is blue why atomic nuclei stick together in principle you've got a big enough computer why dna is the shape it is in principle you should be able to calculate it from that equation can anyone see what it is a bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me i'll make it easier actually by blowing one of the lines up basically each of these terms refers to some of the particles so those ws there refer to the ws and how they stick together these carriers of the weak force the zeds the same but there's an extra symbol in this equation h right h h stands for higgs particle that speed they go around that twenty seven kilometers eleven thousand times a second and we collide them with another beam of protons going in the opposite direction so all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation wouldn't be possible without an extra bit so it's a prediction a prediction of a new particle what does it do well we had a long time to come up with good analogies and back in the nineteen eighties when we wanted the money for the lhc from the uk government the whole universe is full of something called a higgs field higgs particles if you will the analogy is that these people in a room are the higgs particles now when a particle moves through the universe it can interact with these higgs particles but imagine someone who 's not very popular moves through the room then everyone ignores them they can just pass through the room very quickly essentially at the speed of light they're massless and imagine someone incredibly important and popular and intelligent heavy in a sense and massive because they're surrounded by higgs particles they're interacting with the higgs field if that picture 's true then we have to discover those higgs particles at the lhc we collide them inside giant detectors they're essentially digital cameras and this is the one that i work on atlas you get some sense of the size you can just see these eu standard size people so that's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine i'm glad you recognize margaret thatcher actually i thought about making it more culturally relevant but so that's one thing that's essentially a guarantee of what the lhc will find there are many other things you've heard many of the big problems in particle physics one of them you heard about dark matter dark energy so the electromagnetic force the force that holds us together gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures the strong force the strong nuclear force which sticks nuclei together gets weaker what you see is the standard model you can calculate how these change is the forces the three forces other than gravity almost seem to come together at one point it's almost as if there was one beautiful kind of super force back at the beginning of time but they just theory called supersymmetry which doubles the number of particles in the standard model which at first sight doesn't sound like a simplification but actually with this theory we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together back at the big bang many other things that the lhc could discover but in the last few minutes i just want to give you a different perspective i think what particle physics really means to me particle physics and cosmology and that's that i think it's given us a wonderful and i'd say that it deserves in the spirit of wade davis talk to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high andes and the frozen north this is a creation story i think equally as wonderful the story goes like this we know that the universe began thirteen point seven billion years ago in an immensely hot dense state much smaller than a single atom the size forty four meters wide twenty two meters in diameter seven thousand tons and we re create the conditions that were present after the big bang gravity separated away from the other forces the universe then underwent an exponential expansion called inflation in about the first billionth of a second or so the higgs field kicked in and the quarks and the gluons and the electrons that make us up got mass the universe continued to expand and cool after about a few minutes there was hydrogen and helium in the universe that's all the universe was about seventy five percent hydrogen twenty five percent helium it still is today to expand about three hundred million years then light began to travel through the universe it was big enough to be transparent to light and that's what we see in the cosmic microwave background that george smoot described as looking at the face of god so the elements of life carbon and oxygen and iron all the elements that we need to make us up were cooked in those first generations of stars fuel exploded threw those elements back into the universe they then re collapsed into another generation of stars and planets and on some of those planets the oxygen which had been created in that first generation of stars could fuse with hydrogen to form water liquid water on the surface on at least one less than a billionth of a second after the universe began up to six hundred million times a second inside that detector immense numbers and on maybe only one of those planets primitive life evolved which evolved over millions of years into things that walked upright and left footprints about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of tanzania and eventually left a footprint on another world and built this civilization this wonderful picture that turned the darkness into light and you can see the civilization from space as one of my great heroes carl sagan said these are the things and actually not only these but i was looking around these are the things like saturn v rockets and sputnik and dna and literature and science these are the things that hydrogen atoms do when given thirteen point seven billion years carbon and oxygen wouldn't be stable inside the hearts of stars and there would be none of that in the universe and i think it makes me really feel that that civilization which as i say if you believe the scientific creation story emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics and a few hydrogen atoms then i think to me anyway it makes me feel incredibly valuable see those metal bits there those are huge magnets that bend electrically charged particles so it can measure how fast they're traveling this is a picture about a year ago so that's the lhc the lhc is certainly when it turns on in summer going to write the next chapter of that book and i'm certainly looking forward with immense excitement to it being turned on thanks those magnets are in there and again an eu standard size real person so you get some sense of the scale and it's in there that those mini big bangs will be created sometime in the summer this year and actually this morning i got an email saying that we've just finished today,1,"this is the Large Hadron Collider 27 km in circumference is the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted over 10,000 from 85 countries around the world to come together over several decades to build this machine what we do is we accelerate proton soap hydrogen nuclei around ninety nine point nine nine nine nine nine nine to send the speed of light by that speed to go around that 27 km 11 * + * a second and we Collide them with another beam of protons going in the opposite direction. we can light them inside Giant the texts they're Century digital cameras and this is the one that I would come Atlas you got some sense of the size we can just see these EU standard size people and then they got some sense of the size 44 by 23 mi in diameter 7000 tons and we recreate the conditions that would present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began up to 600 million times a second inside that detects an immense numbers how do you say that was the bed and electrically charged particles that we can measure how fast they traveling to the picture about a year ago those magnets are in diet again at a used him to size real person to get some sense of the sky and it's in that those mini big things will be created sometime in the summer this year and I see this morning I got an email saying that we've just finished today building the last piece of that was so as of today is. I'd like to say that I planned that but I didn't do anything completed as of today. that's a wonderful achievement. so you might be asking why why create the conditions that would present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began to understand what everything is made of and how everything fits together and buy everything I mean to cause me and you be the stolen the hundred billions of galaxies and the hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe absolutely everything look at it you want to know what I'm made of let's look at me we found that if you look back in time the universe gets hotter and hotter than serving dancer and simpler and simpler I was no real reason I know we're up for that but that seems to be the case so way back in the early times of the universe we believe it was very simple and understandable all this complexity all the way to these wonderful things human brains are prophecy of an old. cold and complicated Universe back at the start and it says billion to the second We Believe are we going to do is very simple. It's almost like you might get a snowflake in your hand and you look at it and it's an incredibly complicated beautiful objects but it Heats it up if it melts into a pool of water and you would be able to say that actually it was just made of H2O water in that same sense that we look back in time to understand what the universe is made of and as of today it's made these things just 12 Pascal's and Maxa together by full force of nature things are the things that make up protons and neutrons that the thing that goes around the Whitney please held around in all be by the way by the electromagnetic forces coronavirus taking the photos on the cloud to stick together by other things called blue ones and these guys here. familiar but we wouldn't shine and when the sun shines you get copious quantities of these things called neutrinos pouring out actually if you just look at your thumbnail cm2 there's something like sixty billion neutrinos per second from the Sun passing through every Square centimeter of your body but you don't feel them because the weak force is correctly named very short range and very weak so they just fly through you. and these particles have been discovered of the last century pretty much the road in Chicago I know it's a big country Mariah Carey isn't it. so this thing is Discovery 2000 metal devil Universe 100 billion galaxies 13.7 billion light years away is you're not actually is about the same as from Monterey to these things absolutely exquisitely my newts and yet we've discovered pretty much the full sets so one of my most illustrious forebears that much do University for the feds discover the atomic nucleus waumsett all Sciences at the physics or stamp collecting think he meant to insult the rest of science. what I meant was that what we've done really stamp collector and the underlying reason for that you haven't been signs in Italy we have probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century the underpinnings. Passing is the Newton's Laws if you want to call the standard model beautiful simple mathematical equation you can stick it on the front of the t-shirt which is always there to sign of Elegance I've been a little disingenuous could have expanded the aisle and always go where they sell basically everything other than gravity that happens in the universe by the sky is blue in principally got to be enough computer why DNA is the shape it is in principle you should be able to calculate it from that equation but that's a problem. can anyone see what it is these terms refers to the Pasco says W's that refers to do bees and how they stick together these carriers of the week. Is that the same but has an extra symbol in this equation hg0 Higgs particle Higgs particles have not been discovered but they were necessary the necessary to make that mathematics detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation wouldn't be possible without an extra bit so it's a prediction a prediction of a newfound Circle. what does it do well we had a long time to come with me to go to analogies and back in the 1980s when we wanted the money for the other states and the UK government at the time said if you guys can explain in language of politician can understand what the hell it is that you're doing you can have the money I want to know what they say about to go into popsicles and the picture is it the whole universe inside you the whole universe is full of something called the Higgs field if you will these people in a room at the Higgs particles the universe it can interact with a 6 lb equals Becky just passed through the ring very quickly essentially the speed of light that mess was incredibly important and popular and intelligent walks into the room. it's surrounded by people that Passage through the room is impeded it's almost like they get heavy they got massive and that's exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works the picture is that the electrons in the clocks in your body and in the universe that we see around us a heavy in a sentence so massive because they surrounded by Higgs particles with the Higgs field is true then we have to discover that are $6,000 at the LHC if it's not true because it's by a convoluted mechanism as we've been able to think of what I have to tell you say that's one of the Prime reasons we built this giant machine I'm glad you recognize my voice. anyway. so that's one thing that that's essentially guarantee but will still find their many of the things you said many of the big problems in Pasco physics one of them you had a bad. Massa she has another issue which is that the full season night just got beautiful Ashley same as you go back in time they seem to change and strength for the do changing strength electromagnetic force gets stronger as you guys too high a temperature is the strong force the strong nuclear force fix me fly together get weaker the three forces other than gravity almost seemed to come together at one point it was one beautiful kind of soup before back in the beginning of time but they just miss. that's the theory call Sefa symmetry switching doubles the number of Costco's in the standard model B does it sound like a theory we find that the forces of night should do seem to unify together back of the Big Bang Theory peaceful props it to the Mother wasn't built to do that but it seems to do it also does Supa symmetric popsicles a very strong candidates for the dark matter in theory that's really mainstream physics if I was put money on there I would put money on the scientific way that these things would also cover for the LEC. many of the things that they like so you could discover but in the last few minutes I just want to give you a different perspective it is really means to me cuz Mama G I think it's given us a wonderful narrative I'm almost to Creation story if you like about the universe from modern science of the last few decades and I'd say that it deserves in this. Why Davis's talk to it at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories at the the people's B that's how I can be used in the Frozen North Tracy story I think he clearly is wonderful in the story goes like this we know that the Universe began 13.7 billion years ago in an immensely hot dense State smaller than a single axon it began to expand about a million billion billion billion billions of a second after the big bang. Buena Vista underwent an exponential expansion called inflation in the Higgs field kicked in and the quarks and gluons the electron the makers of God Mass the universe continue to expand and cool after about a few minutes it was hydrogen and helium in the universe that's all my percent hydrogen 25% helium still is today he continued to expand about 300 million years then light becomes travel through the universe it was big enough to be transparent and that's what we say in the cosmic microwave background is George Smoot described as looking at the face of God after that phone 2 million years the first stars formed elements to The Elements of Life carbon and oxygen and iron all the elements that we need to make those up with cooked in those first generation of stars we send what I have fuel. 33 those elements back into the universe that you done reached collapse into another generation of stars and planets and some of those planets the oxygen we should been created in that first generation of stars confused with hydrogen to form water liquid water on the surface on at least one and maybe only one of those planets primitive life evolved which evolved over millions of years into things that were right and left footprints that three and a half million years ago and civilization this wonderful picture to turn the darkness in tonight and you can see the civilization from space is one of my great Heroes Carl Sagan said these are the things they use but I was looking around these are the things by Saturn 5 rocket since but Nathan and DNA and literature and science these are the things that hydrogen atoms do when given 13.7 billion. he is absolutely remarkable the laws of physics laws of physics they beautifully balanced if the week for sipping a little bit different when carbon and oxygen wouldn't be stable inside the house of stars and there will be none of that in the universe and I think that's a wonderful and significant story 50 years ago I couldn't have told that story because we didn't know it makes me really feel that. Civilization which is why I say that is if you believe the scientific creation story is emerge purely the result of the laws of physics in a few hydrogen atoms that nothing to me anyway it makes me feel incredibly valuable. so that the LHC Blacc is certainly when it turns on in summer going to write the next chapter of that book and I'm certainly looking forward with immense excitement we've been saying thanks",0.78515625,
72,BrianCox_2010S.sph.wav,sent back by the cassini space probe around saturn after we'd finished filming wonders of the solar system so it isn't in the series the moon enceladus so that big sweeping white sphere in the corner is saturn which is actually in the background of the picture and that crescent there is the moon enceladus which is about as big as the british isles it's about five hundred km in diameter so tiny moon what's fascinating and beautiful this an unprocessed picture by the way i should say it's black and white straight from saturnian orbit what's beautiful is you can probably see in the limb there some faint sort of wisps of almost smoke we live in difficult and challenging economic times of course and one of the first victims of difficult economic times i think is public spending of any kind that's fascinating and beautiful in itself but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon and what's important about that is that on our planet on earth wherever we find liquid water we find life so to find is really quite astounding so what we're saying essentially is maybe that's a habitat for life in the solar system just a few hundred kilometers above the surface and so this again a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space absolutely beautiful but that's not the prime candidate for life in the solar system that's probably this place which is a moon of jupiter europa and again we had to fly to the jovian system to get any sense that this moon as most moons but by measure the way that europa interacts with the magnetic field of jupiter and looking at how those cracks in the ice that you can see there on that graphic move around we've inferred very strongly that there's an ocean of liquid surrounding the entire surface of europa so below the ice there's an ocean of liquid around the whole moon it could be hundreds of kilometers deep we think we think it's saltwater and that would mean that there's more water on that moon of jupiter than there is in all the oceans of the earth combined but certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending for science and particularly curiosity led science and exploration so that place a little moon around jupiter is probably the prime candidate for finding life on a moon or a body outside the earth that we know of tremendous and beautiful discovery our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful it may also have pointed the way to answering one of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask which is are we alone in the universe turbulent year the student riots in paris the height of the vietnam war the reason many people think that about this picture and al gore has said it many times actualy on the stage at ted is that this picture arguably was the beginning of the environmental movement because for the first time we saw our world not as so i want to try and convince you in about fifteen minutes that that's a ridiculous and ludicrous thing to do but i think to set the scene well a solid immovable kind of indestructible place but as a very small fragile looking world just hanging against the blackness of space what's also not often it cost a lot didn't it well actually many studies have been done about the economic effectiveness the economic impact of so the apollo program paid for itself in inspiration in engineering achievement and i think in inspiring young scientists and engineers fourteen times over so exploration can pay for itself what about eighteen eighties eighteen nineties many scientists many observers looked at the light given off from atoms and they saw strange pictures like this you put it through a prism is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn't just glow like a white light it just emits light at particular colors a red one a light blue one i want to show the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst ted slide in the history of ted but it is a bit of a mess now that led to an understanding of atomic structure because the way that's explained is atoms are a single nucleus with electrons going around them and the electrons can only be in particular places and when they jump was one of the key drivers that led to the development of the quantum theory the theory of the structure of atoms i just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable this is actually a picture of the spectrum of the sun but look at the number of black lines in that spectrum and the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the sun helios from the sun now that sounds esoteric and indeed it was an esoteric pursuit but the quantum theory quickly led to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials like silicon for example but actually it's not my fault it's from the guardian newspaper and it's actually a beautiful demonstration of how much science costs because if i'm going to make the case for continuing to spend on curiosity driven science we wouldn't have transistors we wouldn't have silicon chips we wouldn't have pretty much the basis of our modern economy there's one more i think wonderful twist to that in wonders of the solar system we kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal it's one of the most incredible things about the physics imposed on the mass of stars you can work it out on a piece of paper in laboratory get a telescope swing it to the sky and you find that there are no dead stars bigger than one point four times the mass of the sun this is the picture of a galaxy a common our garden galaxy with what one hundred billion stars like our sun in it it's just one of billions of galaxies in the universe there are a billion stars in the galactic core which is why it's shining out so brightly this is about fifty million light years away so one of our neighboring galaxies but that bright star there is actually one of the stars in the galaxy so that star is also fifty million light years away that's an incredible phenomena because it's a star that sits there it's called a carbon oxygen dwarf it sits there about say one point three times the mass of the sun and it has a binary companion that goes around it so a big star a big ball of gas and what it does is it sucks gas off its companion star until it gets to this and then it explodes and it explodes and it shines as brightly as a billion suns for about two weeks and releases not only energy but a huge amount of i should tell you how much it costs so this is a game called spot the science budgets this is the u k government spend you see there it's about six hundred and twenty billion a year the science budget is actually if you look i think that's a remarkable demonstration of the power and beauty and universality of the laws of physics because we understand that process because we understand the structure of atoms i certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world 's first antibiotic now the explorers of the world of the atom did not intend to invent the transistor and they certainly didn't intend to so i think science can be serendipity is important it can be beautiful it can reveal quite astonishing things it can also i think finally reveal the most profound ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet this is a spectacular picture or our home planet now it doesn't look like it looks like saturn because of course it is it was taken by the cassini space probe but it's a famous picture not because of the beauty and majesty of saturn 's rings to your left there's a purple set of blobs and then yellow set of blobs and it's one of the yellow set of blobs but actually because of a tiny faint blob just hanging underneath one of the rings and if i blow it up there you see like a moon but in fact it's a picture of earth it was a picture of earth captured in that frame of saturn that's our planet from seven hundred and fifty million miles away the voyager spacecraft and that's a picture of me in front of it for scale the voyager is a tiny machine it's currently ten billion miles away from very hard to see the earth there it's called the pale blue dot picture but earth is suspended in that shaft of light that's earth from four billion miles away and i'd like to read you what sagan wrote about it just to finish because i cannot say around the big yellow blob it's about three point three billion pounds per year out of six hundred and twenty billion that funds everything in the u k from medical research space exploration words as beautiful as this to describe what he saw in that picture that he had taken he said consider again that that's here that's home that's us on it everyone you love everyone you know everyone you've ever heard of every human being who ever was lived out their lives the aggregates of joy and suffering thousands of confident religions ideologies and economic doctrines every hunter and forager every hero and coward every creator and destroyer of civilization every king and peasant every young couple in love every mother and father hopeful child inventor and explorer every teacher of morals every corrupt politician to me it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot the only home we've ever known where i work at cern in geneva particle physics engineering even arts and humanities funded from the science budget which is that three point three billion that little tiny yellow blob around the orange blob at the top left of the screen the turn of the nineteenth century just exploit it just build things he said this he said nothing is more fatal to the progress of the human mind that our views of science are ultimate that our triumphs are complete that there are no mysteries in nature and that there are no new worlds to conquer thank you,1,really been difficult and challenging Economic Times of course and one of the first victims of difficult Economic Times I think he's certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending the science and particularly curiosity like science and exploration so I want to try and convince you in about 15 minutes so that's a ridiculous and ludicrous thing to do but I think I want to show the next flight is not my attempt to show the worst Ted slide in history of head but it is a bit of a mess from The Guardian newspaper a beautiful demonstration of how much times cost because if I'm going to make the case for continuing to spend on curiosity-driven science desperation I should tell you how much is a game called a government spend to see there is 620 billion a year the signs. she is actually if you look to your left to the Turtle sets of gloves and then yellow sets of gloves and it's one of the yellow sets of lumps around the big yellow blob it's about 3.3 billion lb to ya House of 620 billion in the UK for medical research space exploration when I was concerned in Geneva thoughts go visit engineering even out some Humanity from date from the signs budget which is that 3.3 billion that little tiny yellow blobs around the Orange Bowl of the top left of the screen so that's what we're arguing about the sentence by the way is about the same in the US and Germany and France and R&B in total in the economy is something that publicly funded by .6% to GDP so that's what we're arguing about. the first thing I want to say in this is straight from whims of the solar system is that our exploration of the solar system in the universe has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful it's in the picture that I actually sent that by the Cassini Space Program Santa and after we finished filming Windows of the solar system so it isn't in the series it's at the moon Enceladus so that fix sweeping white sphere in The Culinary Center in the back and the picture I'm at present there is the moon Enceladus which is about as big as the British Isles it's about five hundred kilometers in diameter of tiny moon was fascinating and beautiful this is one process picture by the way I should say it's black and white stripe from festering you know if it was beautiful that you can put some fance Savannah smoke rising up from the limb and this is how we visualize that they wanted to see the solar system it's a beautiful graphic what we found out that those wisps are actually found him. nice rising up from the surface of the Tiny Moon and that's fascinating and beautiful in itself but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires that to the lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this Moon and what's important about that is that on our planets on us wherever we find liquid water and we find life so Define strong evidence of liquid pools of liquid beneath the surface of the Moon 750 million miles away from the Earth is really quiet standing so what we saying this Angel is maybe that's a habitat for life in the solar system. well let me just say that was a graphic I just want to show you this picture that's one more picture of Enceladus this is when Cassini flu be nice and salad sa made a very low pass just a few hundred kilometers above the surface and so this is a real picture of a nice pants and rising up in space absolutely beautiful but that's not the prime candidate for life in the solar system that's probably this place which is a moon of Jupiter Europa and again we have to fly to the Jovian system to get any sense that these this moon has the most moons was anything other than a dead ball of rock it's actually a nice mood so what you're looking at is the surface of the Moon you wrote don't you think she's two bites probably 100 km thick by measuring the way that you wrote that interacts with the magnetic field of Jupiter and looking at have those cracks in the eyes that can see that in that graphic move around we've been fed very strongly it is an ocean of liquid surrounding the entire surface of Europa So Below the ice as an ocean of liquid around the whole Moon. it could be hundreds of kilometres date we think we think it's salt water and that would mean it is more is more water on that moon of Jupiter than there is in all the oceans of the earth combined so that place a little Moon around Jupiter is probably the prime candidate finding life on the moon or a buddy that's idea that we know of tremendous and beautiful Discovery and exploration of the solar system installed says that the solar system is beautiful it may also be pointed the way to Andre one of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask what she's alone in the universe. is there any other used to aspiration and science other than just a sense of wonder well there is this is a very famous picture taken Ashley and Mike says Christmas Eve December 24th 1968 when I was about eight months old was taken by Apollo 8 but it went around the back of the Moon and that's rice from Apollo 8 the famous picture many people said there's a picture to save 1968 which was a turbulent year and the student riots in Paris the height of the Vietnam War the reason many people think that about this picture and I'll go over said it many times I plan on the stage of Ted is that this picture I'll give you a recent beginning of the environmental movement because for the first time we saw we saw I will not as well as a solid immovable have indestructible place but as a very small fragile looking we'll just hang in against the Blackness of space what's also not often said about the. separation about the Apollo program is the economic contribution it made I mean once you can make the argument that it was wonderful and a tremendous achievement and delivered Pages like this it cost a lot actually many Studies have been done about the economic Effectiveness their economic impacts of Apollo the biggest one was in 1975 by Chase in the metrics and it showed that for every $1 spent on Apollo 14 came back into the US economy so the Apollo program paid for itself and inspiration in engineering achievements and I think an inspiring young scientist engineered 14 times over expiration can pay for itself what about scientific discovery what about driving Innovation Melissa is a it looks like a picture of Ashley spend time what is it a picture of the spectrum of hydrogen sea back in the 1880s and 1890s many scientists many observers looked at the. light given off from items and they sell strange pictures like this what you're saying when you put it through a prism is that you eat hydrogen know if it doesn't just blow like a like a white light and just admit this line to pick your colors are red wine the light blue one some. Blue ones that lead to an understanding of atomic structure because they explained his actions are single nucleus where electrons going around them and electrons can only be in particular places and when they jump up to the next place they can be a fall back down again they make lights in particular colors inside the fact that only made life very specific colors was one of the key drivers that led to the development of the quantum theory a theory of the structure of atoms I just wanted to share this picture because this is this is actually a picture of a spectrum of the Sun and now this is a picture of atoms in the Sun that must be absorbing light and again they only absorb line to particular colors when electrons jump up from Fall Down. jump up and fall down but look at the number of black lines in that spectrum and the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the sun because some of those black lines with fam that correspond to know known elements that's why helium's called helium it's called Helios Helios some Theory quickly lead to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials like Silicon for example the way that silicon behaves the fact that you can build transistors is a purely Quantum phenomena so we got that curiosity-driven understanding the structure that seems which lights this rather Egypt Eric Theory quantum mechanics then we would not transistors who would have silicon chips we wouldn't have pretty much the basis of a modern economy was one more I think wonderful Twisted at tail. in the windows of the solar system we can't emphasize in the laws of physics are Universal it's one of the most incredible things about the physics and the understanding of nature that you got on the is you can transport it not only for the planet supposed to the most distant stars and galaxies and one of these donation predictions of quantum mechanics just by looking the structure that seems the same favorite is five transistors there can be no stars in the universe that have reached the end of their life but a bigger than quite specifically 1.4 times the mass of the Sun at the limits imposed on the mask of stars you can work it out on a piece of paper in Livonia tree get a telescope swing it to the sky and you find that there are no dead stars bigger than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun that's quite incredible prediction what happens when you have a style that's right on the end that mess most of the picture of it is it a picture of a galaxy a common or garden galaxy with a hundred billion stars like I was some in it it's just one. billions of galaxies in the universe para a billion stars in the galactic core which is why is shining so brightly that 50 million light-years away so one of our neighboring galaxies bright star that is actually one of the stars in the galaxy so that star is also 50 million light-years away is possible Galaxy and it's shining as brightly as the center of the Galaxy video with Billy and Sons in it not the type 1A Supernova explosion that ass and incredible phenomena because it's a star that says that is called a dwarf it's his dad about what's a 1.3 * a mess of the Sun and has a binary companion that goes around it to a big star a big ball of gas does it sucks gas companion style until it gets to the limits call the chandrasekhar limit and then it explodes and that explodes and it shines as brightly as a billion Suns for about 2 weeks and releases. not only energy but a huge amount of chemical elements into the universe in fact that one is a carbon oxygen do off at it was no Calvin an oxygen in the universe have a big bang and there's no Calvin an oxygen the universe throughout the first generation of stars it was made and styles like that blocks away and then return to the universe and explosions like that in order to read condensed into planets Styles new solo systems and indeed people like those I think that's a remarkable demonstration of the power and beauty of universality of the laws of physics because we understand that price because we understand the structure structure that seems they are beautiful quote that I found we talked about serendipity the late nineteen twenty-eight I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all men stand by to Schoo renewals but it's time to buy I'll take that explore did not intend to invent the transistor and they said they didn't intend. describe the mechanics of supernova explosions which eventually told us where the building blocks of life with synthesized in the universe. so I think science can be the sort Serendipity is important it can be beautiful I can reveal quite astonishing things it can also I think Finally Revealed the most profound ideas to us about a place in the universe and really devalue about whom Planet this is a spectacular picture of my home planet now it doesn't look like it looks like that's in because of course it is it was taken by the Cassini space probe but it's a famous picture not because of the beauty and Majesty of Saturn's rings but actually because of a tiny saying blob just hanging out underneath one of the Rings If I blow it up by you say it it looks like the moon but in fact it's picture of us with a picture of us captured in that frame of Santa and that's it from 750 Million Miles Away I think the Earth is got a strange prophecy that the other way you got for me the most beautiful it seems but that is not the most distant Almost Famous picture about. Senators taken by this thing she called the Voyager spacecraft and that's a picture of me in front of it before and scale Voyage was a tiny machine is currently 10 billion miles away from the transmission with that dish with the power of 20 walks and we still in contact with it but if it is to Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune and after a visit at all for that those planets Carl Sagan he's one of my great Heroes had the the wonderful idea of turning Voyager around and taking a picture of every planet has visited and it took this picture of us that's very hard to see the that is called a pale blue dot picture but ended in that red shaft of light that says I'm four billion miles away and I'd like to read you up so you can rest up and sit just two to finish because I cannot say words beautiful is best described what he saw in that picture that he had taken you could consider a game that don't that's here that's home that's so funny. every everyone you loved everyone you know everyone you've ever heard of every human being who ever was lived out their lives of joy and suffering thousands of comfort in religion and ideologies and economic.

73,BrianGreene_2005.sph.wav,in cern geneva switzerland a machine is being built called the large hadron collider it's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel opposite directions near the speed of light every so often those particles will be aimed at each other so there's a head on collision the hope is that if the collision has enough energy it may eject some of the debris from the collision from our dimensions after the collision than before this will be evidence that the energy has drifted away and if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there let me show you that idea visually so imagine we a certain kind of particle called a graviton that's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out if the extra dimensions are real but here 's how the experiment will go you take these particles you slam them together you slam them together and if we are right some of the energy of that collision will go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions so this is the kind of experiment that we'll be looking at in the next five seven to ten years or so and if this experiment bears fruit if we see that kind of particle ejected theory of gravity in the late sixteen hundreds that works well describes the motion of planets the motion of the moon and so forth by noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions than when we began this will show that the extra dimensions are real and to me this is a really remarkable story and a remarkable opportunity going back to newton with absolute space didn't provide anything but an arena a stage in which the events of the universe take place einstein comes along and says well space and time can warp and curve that's what gravity is and now string theory comes along and says yes gravity quantum mechanics electromagnetism all together in one package but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see and this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime the motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees hitting people on the head all of that could be described using newton 's work but einstein realized that newton had left something out of the story because even newton had written that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity he'd been unable to figure out how it really works how is it that the sun ninety three million miles away somehow the motion of the earth how does the sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence and that is a task to which einstein set himself to figure out how gravity works and let me show you what it is that he found so einstein found that the medium that transmits gravity is space itself the idea goes like this a virtually unknown german mathematician named theodor kaluza of space to warp to curve and that communicates the force of gravity even the earth warps space around it now look at the moon the moon is kept in orbit according to these ideas because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment that the sun and the moon and the earth can all create by virtue of their presence we go to a full frame view of this the earth itself is kept in orbit because it rolls along a valley in the environment that's curved because of the sun 's presence that is this new idea about how actually works now one theory that might be able to describe all of nature 's forces from one set of ideas one set of principles one master equation if you will so kaluza said to himself einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of warps and curves in space in fact space and time to be more precise maybe i can play the same game with the other known force which a very bold and in some ways a very bizarre idea he proposed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions was at that time known as the electromagnetic force we know of others today but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about you know the force responsible for electricity and magnetic attraction and so forth so kaluza says maybe i can play the same game and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves that raised a question warps and curves in what so kaluza said well maybe there are more dimensions of space he said if i want to describe one more force maybe i need one more dimension so he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space not three and imagined that electromagnetism was warps and curves in that fourth dimension now here 's the thing when he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves in a universe with four space dimensions not three he found the old equations that einstein had already derived in three dimensions those were for gravity but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension and when he looked at that equation it was none other than the equation that scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force amazing it just popped out he was so excited by this realization that he ran around his house screaming victory that he had found kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously he in fact there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim that we are all aware of that is in addition to left right back forth and up down kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason he read a book a treatise on swimming then dove into the ocean this is a man who would risk his life on theory now but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded two questions immediately arise from his observation number one if there are more dimensions in space where are they seem to see them and number two does this theory really work in detail when you try to apply it to the world around us now the first question there might be big easy to see dimensions but there might also be tiny curled up dimensions curled up so small even though they're all around us that we don't see them let me show you that one visually but you and i all know that it does have some thickness it's very hard to see it though from far away but if we zoom in and take the perspective of say a little ant walking around little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions the long dimension but also this clockwise counter clockwise direction and i hope you appreciate this it took so long to get these ants to do this but this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts big and small and the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can easily see but there might be additional dimensions curled up sort of like the circular part of that cable so small that they have so far remained invisible let me show you what that would look like so if we take a look say at space itself i can only show of course two dimensions on a screen some of you guys will fix that one day but anything that's not flat on a screen is a new dimension goes smaller smaller smaller and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself this is the idea you could have additional curled up dimensions here is a little shape of a circle so small that we don't see them but if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around you could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about that's like the grid part but you could also access the tiny curled up so small that we can't see it with the naked eye or even with any of our most refined equipment but deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself the idea is there could be more dimensions as we see there now that's an explanation about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see but what about the second question that i asked does the theory actually work when you try to apply it to the real world well it turns out that einstein and kaluza and many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as was understood at the time detail it didn't work in detail for instance they couldn't get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory so many people worked on it but by the by the fifties this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away until something wonderful happened in our age in our era a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself many others around the world it's called superstring theory as you were indicating around us this particular idea however although we don't yet know whether it's right or wrong and at the end i'll discuss experiments which in the next few years may tell us whether it's right or wrong and the wonderful thing is that superstring theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions theory that tries to answer the question what are the basic fundamental indivisible uncuttable constituents making up everything in the world around us the idea is like this so imagine we look at a familiar object just a we also all know that atoms are not the end of the story they have little even the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as quarks that is where conventional ideas stop here is the new idea of string theory deep inside any of these particles there is something else this something else is this dancing filament of energy it looks like a vibrating string that's where the idea string theory comes from and just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello can vibrate in different patterns these can also vibrate in different patterns they don't produce different musical notes rather they produce the different particles making up the world around us these ideas are correct this is what the ultra microscopic landscape of the universe looks like it's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments vibrating energy vibrating in different frequencies the different frequencies produce the different particles the different particles this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century and continues to inform a lot of cutting edge research so i'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions are responsible for all the richness in the world around us and there you see unification because matter particles electrons and quarks put together under the rubric of vibrating strings and that's what we mean by a unified theory now here is the catch when you study the mathematics of string theory you find that it doesn't work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space it doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space nor five nor six finally you can study the equations and show that it works only in a universe that has ten dimensions of space and one dimension of time us right back to this idea of kaluza and klein that our world when appropriately described has more dimensions than the ones that we see now you might think about that and say well ok you know if you have extra dimensions and they're really tightly curled up that is true one of the other predictions of string theory no that's not one of the other predictions of string theory but it raises the question are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions or do they tell us something about the world in the remaining time i'd like to tell you two features of them first is many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question in theoretical physics theoretical science and that question is this when we look around the world as scientists have done for the last hundred years there appear to be about twenty numbers that really describe our universe these are numbers like the mass of the particles like electrons and quarks the strength of gravity the strength of the electromagnetic force a list of about twenty numbers that have been measured with incredible precision but nobody has an explanation for why the numbers have the particular values that they do if those numbers had any other values than the known ones the universe as we know it wouldn't exist this is a deep question why are those numbers so finely tuned to allow stars to shine and planets to form when we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers if i had twenty dials up here and i let you come up and fiddle with those numbers almost any fiddling makes the universe disappear so can we explain those twenty numbers and string theory suggests that those twenty numbers have to do with the extra dimensions let me show you how so when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory it's not one extra dimension as in the older ideas of kaluza and klein this is what string theory says about the extra dimensions they have a very rich intertwined geometry this is an example of something known as a calabi yau shape name isn't all that important but as you can see the extra dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape interesting structure and the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales when you swing your hand you'd be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again but they're so small that we wouldn't know it so what is the physical implication though relevant to those twenty numbers consider this if you look at the instrument a french horn notice that the vibrations of the airstreams are affected by the shape of the instrument now in string theory all the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate so just as those airstreams are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument strings themselves will be affected by the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving so let me bring some strings into the story and if you watch these little fellows vibrating around they'll be there in a second right there notice that they way they vibrate is affected by the geometry of the extra dimensions so if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like we don't yet but if we did we should be able to calculate the allowed notes the allowed vibrational patterns and if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns we should be able to calculate those twenty numbers and if the answer that we get from our calculations agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determined through detailed and precise experimentation this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is the way it now the second issue that i want to finish up with how might we test for these extra dimensions more directly is this just an interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some previously unexplained features of the world or can we actually test for these extra dimensions and we think and this is i think very exciting that in the next five years or so we may be able to test for the existence of these extra dimensions here 's how it goes and in that moment there are many people around who thought that that project had already been resolved newton had given the world,1,in the year 1919. a virtually unknown German mathematician named pewter Colusa. suggested a very bold and in some ways very bizarre idea he proposed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions that we are all aware of that is in addition to left right back forth an up-down clue to the proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don't yet see now when someone makes a bold and bizarre ideas sometimes that's all it is bold bizarre but has nothing to do with the world around us this particular idea however although we don't yet know whether it's right or wrong and at the end of discuss experiments which in the next two years may tell us whether it's right or wrong this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century and continue to inform a lot of cutting-edge research so I'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra Dimensions so where do we go to begin needle bit of backstory go to 1906. this is a year when Einstein is Basking in the glow of having discovered the special theory of relativity and decide to take on a new project to try to understand fully the grand pervasive force of gravity and in that moment there were many people around who fought that that project had already been resolved Newton had given the world a theory of gravity late sixteen hundreds that works well describes the motion of planets the motion of the Moon and so forth the motion of apocryphal apples falling from trees hitting people in the head all of that could be described using Newton's work but Einstein realize that Nunez left something out of the story because even Newton had written that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity have been unable to figure out how it really works how is it that the sun 93 Million Miles Away somehow it affects the motion. the Earth how does the sun Reach Out across empty space and exert influence and that is a task to which Einstein set himself to figure out how gravity works and let me show you what it is that he found do Einstein found that the medium that transmits gravity is space itself the idea goes like this imagine space is a substrate of all the Rizzo said space is nice and flat if there's no matter present but if there is matter in the environment such as the Sun at causes the fabric of space to work to curve and that communicates the force of gravity even the Earth warp space around it and I'll look at the Moon the Moon is kept in orbit according to these ideas because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment that the Sun and the Moon and the Earth can all create by virtue of their presents we go to a full frame view of this the Earth itself is Captain or because it rolls along a valley. the environment that curve because of the son's presents that is this new idea about how gravity actually works now. this idea was tested in 1919 through astronomical observations it really works it describes the data and this gained Einstein prominence around the world and that is what God kaluta thinking like Einstein was a search of what we call a unified theory that's one theory that might be able to describe all of Nature's forces from one set of ideas one set of principles one master equation if you will the closest said to himself Einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of warps and Curves in space and fax space and time to be more precise maybe I can play the same game with the other known for switch was at that time known as the electromagnetic force we know of others today but that time that was the only other one people are thinking about you know the force responsible for electricity and magnetic attraction and so forth so close that says maybe I can play the same game it just bribe electromagnetic force in terms of War. in curves that raised a question warps and Curves in what. Einstein had already used up space and time warps and curves to describe gravity didn't seem to be anything else to warper curve. Circle it said well maybe there are more dimensions of space she said if I wanted to try one more for us maybe I need one more Dimension so he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space and not three and imagine that electromagnetism was warped and Curves in that fourth dimension now here's the thing when he wrote down the equations describing warps and Curves in the universe who Force base dimensions not 3 he found the old equations that Einstein had already Drive in three dimensions those were for Gravity but he found one more equation because of the one more Dimension and when he looked at that equation it was none other than the equation that scientists have long known to describe the electromagnetic force amazing it just popped out he was so excited by this realization that he ran around his house screaming victory that he had found the unified theory. now clearly Calypso was a man who took very very seriously in fact there's a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim he read a book A Treatise on swimming. then drove into the ocean this is a man who would risk his life on fiery now but for those of us who are a little more practically minded two questions immediately arise from his observation number one if there are more dimensions in space where are they we don't seem to see them and number to does this Theory really work in detail when you try to apply it to the world around us now the first question was answered in 1926 by a fellow named Oscar Klein he suggested that Dimensions might come in two varieties there might be Big Easy to see Dimensions but there may also be kind of product Dimensions product so small even though they're all around us that we don't see them let me show you that one visually. so I imagined looking at something like a cable supporting a traffic light is in Manhattan to Central Park is it's kind of irrelevant but the table looks one-dimensional from a distant view point but you and I will know that it does have some sickness it's very hard to see it though from far away but if we resume in and take their perspective to say a little ant walking around little answer so small that they can access all the dimension the long to mention but also is clockwise counterclockwise Direction and I hope you appreciate this it took so long to get these ants to do this but this illustrates the fact that Dimension scampi of sorts big and small and the ideas and maybe the big Dimensions around us are the ones that we can easily see but there might be additional Dimensions curled up sort of like the circular part of that cable so small that they have so far remained invisible let me show you what that would look like so if we take a look say at space itself. I can only show of course two dimensions on a screen some you guys will fix that one day but anything that's not flatten the screen is a new dimension goes smaller smaller smaller and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself this is the idea you can have additional curled up Dimensions here is a little shape of a circle so small that we don't see them but if you were a little ultra-microscopic Aunt walking around you can walk in the big Dimensions that we all know about that's like the grid part but you can also access the tiny curled up to mention that's so small that we can't see with the naked eye or even with any of her most refined equipment but deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself the idea is there could be more Dimensions as we see you there now. that's an explanation about how the universe could have more Dimensions than the ones that we see but what about the second question that I asked does the Theory actually work when you try to apply to the real world well it turns out that Einstein inclusa and many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as was understood at the time and it detail it didn't work and detail friends and they couldn't get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this Theory so many people worked on it but by the 40s by the 50s this strange but very compelling idea of how do you defy the laws of physics had gone away. until something wonderful happened in our age an h e r o a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself many others around the world it's called superstring Theory as you were indicating and the wonderful thing is that superstring theory has nothing to do at First Sight with this idea of extra Dimensions but we study superstring Theory find it resurrects the idea no sparkling new form let me just tell you how that goes superstring Theory what is it what the fear that tries to answer the question what are the basic fundamentals indivisible uncuttable constituents making up everything in the world around us the idea is like this so imagine we look at a familiar object just a candle in a holder and imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of so we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituent to deep inside we all know you go fishing. far down you have Adam's we also know that atoms are not the end of the story they have little electron that swarm around a central nucleus with neutrons and protons even the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as Cork's that is where conventional ideas.. here is the new idea of string theory deep inside any of these particles there is something else that something else is dancing filament of energy it looks like a vibrating string that's where the idea String Theory comes from and just like the vibrating strings that you just saw on a cello can vibrate in different patterns these can also vibrating different patterns they don't produce different musical notes rather they produced the different particles making up the world around us that these ideas are correct this is what the ultra microscopic landscape of the universe looks like it's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments a vibrating energy vibrating and different frequencies the different frequencies produce the different particles different particles are responsible for all the richest man in the world around us and there you see unification because matter particles electrons and quarks radiation particles photons gravitons are all built up from 1. to take the matter and the forces of nature all are put together under the rubric of vibrating strings and that's what we mean by a unified theory and here is the catch. when you study the mathematics of strengths are you find that it doesn't work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space it doesn't work in the universe with four dimensions of space nor 5 North 6 finally you can study the equation to show that it works only in the universe that has 10 dimensions of space and one dimension of time lead us right back to this idea of clue sink line that our world when appropriately described has more Dimensions than the ones that we see now you might think about that and say well okay you know if you have extra dimensions in the really tightly curled up yeah perhaps perhaps we won't see them if they're small enough but you know if there's a little tiny civilization the green people walking around on their you make them small enough and we won't see them either. that is true one of the other predictions of string theory. nope that's not one of the other predictions of string theory but it raises a question are we just trying to hide away these extra Dimensions or do they tell us something about the world and the remaining time I'd like to tell you two features of them. first is many of us believe that these extra Dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question in theoretical physics theoretical science and that question is this when we look around the world as scientist have down for last hundred years there appeared to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universities are numbers like the mass of the particles like electrons and quarks the strength of gravity the strength of the electromagnetic force a list of about 20 numbers that have been measured with Incredible Precision but nobody has an explanation for why the numbers have the particular values that they do. now. the string theory often answered not yet but we believe the answer to why those numbers have devised they do May rely on the form of the extra dimensions in the wonderful thing is if those numbers had any other values than than known ones the universe as we know it wouldn't exist this is a deep question why does number so finely tuned to allow stars to Sean and planets the form when we recognize that if you fit with those numbers if I had 20 dials up here and let you come up and Fiddle with those numbers almost any fiddlin' makes. the universe disappear to can we explain with those 20 numbers in string theory suggests that the 20 members have to do with the extra Dimensions let me show you how do when we talked about the extra dimensions in string theory it's not one extra Dimension as in the older ideas of Colusa and Kline this is what String Theory says about the extra Dimensions they have a very rich intertwined geometry this is an example of something known as a claw be out of shape name isn't all that important but as you can see the extra Dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwined in a very interesting shape interesting structure and the idea is that if this is what the extra Dimensions look like then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales when you swing your hand to be moving around his extra Dimensions over and over again but they're so small that we would know it to what is the physical implication. relevant with 20 numbers consider this look at the instrument of French horn noticed that the vibrations of air streams are affected by the shape of the instrument now and string theory all the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate to Justice those are streams are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument strings themselves will be affected by the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving to let me bring some strings into the story and if you watch these little fellows vibrating around will be here in a second right there nor that the way they vibrate is affected by the geometry of the extra Dimensions so if we knew exactly what the actual dimensions look like we don't yet but if we did we should be able to calculate the allowed notes the allowed vibrational patterns and if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns we should be able to calculate those 20 numbers at the answer that we get from our calculations agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determined. detailed and precise experimentation this in many ways would be the First Fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is the way it is now the second issue that I want to finish up with his. how might we test for these extra Dimensions more directly is this just an interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some previously unexplained features of the world Orca me actually test for the extra Dimension than we think this is I think very exciting that the next five years or so we may be able to test for the existence of these extra Dimensions here's how it goes. in CERN Geneva Switzerland a machine is being built for the Large Hadron Collider it's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel opposite directions near the speed of light every so often those particles will be aimed at each other till there's a head-on collision. the hope is that if the Collision has enough energy it may eject some of the debris from the Collision from our Dimensions forcing it to enter into the other dimensions how do we know it will measure the amount of energy after the Collision compare it to the amount of energy before and afters less energy after the Collision then before this will be evidence that the energy has drifted away and if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate this would be evidence that the extra dimensions are there let me show you that idea visually so imagine we have a certain kind of particles called a graviton that's the kind of debris we expect to be a ejected out if they have two dimensions are real but here is how the experiment will go you take these particles you slam them together you slamming together and if we are right some of the energy of that Collision will go into debris that flies off into these extra Dimensions so this is the kind of experiment that will be looking at the next 5-7 to 10 years or so. and if this experiment bears fruit if we see that kind of particle it ejected by noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions then when we began this will show that the extra dimensions are real and to me this is a really remarkable store in a remarkable opportunity going back to Newton with absolute space didn't write anything but an Arena Stage and went to the event the universe take place Einstein comes along and says well space and time can warp incur that's what gravity is and now String Theory comes along and says yes gravity quantum mechanics electromagnetism altogether one package but only if the universe has more Dimensions than the ones that we see. and this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime amazing possibility thank you very much,0.7643228769302368,
74,BrianSkerry_2010Z.sph.wav,the icy twenty nine degree water but as i got more involved in the story i realized that there were two big environmental issues i couldn't ignore the first was that these animals continue to be hunted killed with hakapiks at about eight fifteen days old it actually is the largest marine mammal slaughter on the planet with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year and even though we see a lot of ice in this picture there's a lot of water as well which wasn't there historically and the ice that is there is quite the problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice in order to nurse from their moms they only need twelve days from the moment they're born until their on their own but if they don't get twelve days they can fall into the ocean and die a photo that i made showing one of these pups that's only about five or seven days old still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly that has fallen in because of the thin ice and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe and to get it back to stable purchase i would like to share with you this morning some stories about the ocean through my work as a still photographer for national geographic magazine this problem has continued to grow each year since i was there i read that last year the pup mortality rate was one hundred percent in parts of the gulf of st lawrence so clearly this species has a lot of problems going forward this ended up becoming a cover story at national geographic and it received quite a bit of attention and with that i saw the potential to begin doing other stories about ocean problems so i proposed a story on the global fish crisis in part because i had personally witnessed a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last thirty years but also because i read a scientific paper stated ninety percent of the big fish in the ocean have disappeared in the last fifty or sixty years these are the tuna the billfish and the sharks and when i read that i was blown away by those numbers i thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet but it really wasn 't so i wanted to do a story that was a very different kind of the first component of the story that i thought was essential however was to give readers a sense of appreciation for the ocean animals that they were eating i think people go into a restaurant and somebody orders a steak and we all know where steak comes from and somebody orders a chicken and we know what a chicken is in reality these animals have no terrestrial counterpart they're unique in the world these are animals that can practically swim from the equator to the poles and can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a year if we weren't so efficient at catching them because they grow their entire life would have thirty year old bluefin out there that weigh a ton but the truth is we're way too efficient at catching them i guess i became an underwater photographer and a photojournalist because i fell in love with the sea as a child and i wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things i was seeing underwater just warehouse after warehouse and as i wandered around and made these pictures it sort of occurred to me that the ocean 's not a grocery store you know we can't keep taking without expecting serious consequences as a result i also with the story wanted to show readers how fish are caught some of the methods that are used to catch fish like a bottom trawler which is one of the most common methods in the world this was a small net that was being used in mexico to catch shrimp but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world you have a large net in the middle with two steal doors on either end and as this assembly is towed through the water the doors meet resistance with the ocean and it opens the mouth of the net and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom and this just drags over the bottom in this case to catch shrimp but as you can imagine it's catching everything else in its path as well and it's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom things like sponges and corals that critical habitat for other animals so this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner maybe seven or eight shrimp and ten lbs of other animals that had to die in the process and to make that point even more visual i swam under the shrimp boat and made the this picture of the guy shoveling this bycatch into the sea as trash and photographed this cascade of death you know animals like guitarfish bat rays flounder pufferfish that only an hour before were on the bottom of the ocean alive but now being thrown back as trash i also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry because currently on planet earth we're killing over one hundred million sharks every single year but before i went out to photograph this component i sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers you know i think there's still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark but this one morning i jumped in and found this thresher that had just recently died in the gill net and with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible it struck me as sort of a crucifixion if you will because i love sharks i'm somewhat obsessed with sharks i wanted to do another more celebratory story about sharks as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation so i went to the bahamas because there's very few places in the world where sharks are doing well these days but the bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy largely due to the fact that the government there had outlawed longlining several years ago and i wanted to show several species that we hadn't shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations one of the locations was this place called tiger beach in the northern bahamas where tiger sharks aggregate in shallow water this is a low altitude photograph that i made showing our diving boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks sort of just swimming around behind but the one thing i definitely didn't want to do with this coverage was to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters i didn't want them to be overly threatening or scary and with this photograph of a beautiful fifteen ft probably fourteen ft i guess female tiger shark i sort of think got to that goal where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose and my strobe created a shadow on her face and i think it's a gentler picture a little less threatening a little more respectful of the species creature but this an animal that's considered data deficient by science in both florida and in the bahamas you know we know almost nothing about them we don't know where they migrate to or from where they mate where they have their pups but more and more frequently these days i'm seeing terrible things underwater as well things that i don't think most people realize and yet hammerhead populations in the atlantic have declined about eighty percent in the last twenty to thirty years you know we're losing them faster than we can possibly find them this is the oceanic whitetip shark an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species if you pay attention to such lists but it's an animal that's about ninety eight percent in decline throughout most of its range because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water and because we weren't working on the bottom i brought along shark cage here and my friend shark biologist wes pratt is inside the cage you'll see that the photographer of course was not inside the cage here so clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer i guess and lastly with this story i also wanted to focus on baby sharks nurseries and i went to the island of bimini in the bahamas to work with lemon shark pups this is a photo of a lemon shark pup and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives in these protective mangroves and i've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues to tell a more complete story i want people to see what's happening underwater both the horror and the magic on the rest of the reef after i left bimini i actually learned that this habitat was being bulldozed to create a new golf course and resort and other recent stories have looked at single flagship species if you will that are at risk in the ocean as a way of talking about other threats one such story i did documented the leatherback sea turtle this is the largest widest ranging deepest diving and oldest of all turtle species here we see a female crawling out of the ocean under moonlight on the island of trinidad these are animals whose lineage dates back about one hundred million years and there was a time in their lifespan where they were coming out of the water to nest and saw tyrannosaurus rex running by and today they crawl out and see condominiums but despite this amazing longevity they're now considered critically endangered in the pacific where i made this photograph their stocks have declined about ninety percent in the last fifteen years this is a photograph that shows a hatchling about to taste saltwater for the very first time beginning this long and perilous journey only one in a thousand the first story that i did for national geographic where i recognized the ability to include environmental issues within a natural history coverage was a story i proposed on harp seals another charismatic megafauna species that i worked with is the story i did on the right whale and essentially the story is this with right whales that about a million years ago there was one species of right whale on the planet but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated the species sort of separated and today we have essentially two distinct stocks we have the southern right whale that we see here the north atlantic right whale that we see here with a mom and calf off the coast of florida now both species were hunted to the brink of extinction by the early whalers but the southern right whales have rebounded a lot better because they're located in places farther away from human activity the north atlantic right whale is listed as the most endangered species on the planet today because they are urban whales they live along the east coast of north america united states and canada and they have to deal with these urban ills this photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of florida you can see the coal burning plant in the background they have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals that are flushed out into the ocean and may be even affecting their reproduction they also get entangled in fishing gear this is picture that shows the tail of a right whale and those white markings are not natural markings these are entanglement scars the other problem is they get hit by ships and this was an animal that was struck by a ship in nova scotia canada being towed in where they did a necropsy to now the story i wanted to do initially was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year where these animals migrate down from the canadian arctic sub antarctic of of new zealand a place called the auckland islands i went down there in the winter time and these are animals that had never seen humans before and one of these amazingly beautiful forty five ft seventy ton whales like a city bus just swimming up you know they were in perfect condition very fat and healthy robust no entanglement scars the way they're suppose to i settled on working in the country of new zealand because new zealand was rather progressive and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean and i really wanted this story to be about three things i wanted it to be about abundance about diversity and about resilience and one of the first places i worked was to the gulf of st lawrence in canada to engage in courtship mating and to have their pups and all of this is played out against the backdrop of transient pack ice that moves with wind and tide these fish predate on sea urchins and when the fish were all gone all anyone ever saw underwater was just acres and acres of sea urchins but when the fish came back and began predating and controlling the urchin population low and behold kelp forests emerged in shallow water and that's because the urchins eat kelp so when the fish control the urchin population the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium you know this is probably how the ocean looked here one or two hundred years ago but nobody was around to tell us i worked in other parts of new zealand as well in beautiful fragile protected areas like in fiordland where this sea pen colony was found little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color in the northern part of new zealand i dove in the blue water where the water 's a little warmer and photographed animals like this giant sting ray swimming through an underwater canyon every part of the ecosystem in this place seems very healthy from tiny little animals like a nudibrank crawling over encrusting or a leatherjacket that is a very important animal in this ecosystem because it grazes on the bottom and allows new life to take i wanted to finish with this photograph a picture i made on a very stormy day in new zealand when i just laid on the bottom amidst a school of fish swirling around me and i was in a place that had only been protected about twenty years ago and i talked to divers that had been diving there for many years and they said that the marine life was better here today than it was in the nineteen sixties and that's because it's been protected that it has come back i became an underwater photographer because i fell in love with the sea and i make pictures of it today because i want to protect it and i don't think it's too late thank you very much,1,I like to share with you this morning some stories about the ocean through my work is a still photographer for National Geographic magazine. I guess I became a underwater photographer in a photojournalist because I fell in love with the sea as a child and I wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things that I was seeing underwater credible Wildlife an interesting behaviors and after even 30 years of doing this after 30 years of exploring the ocean ice never cease to be amazed the extraordinary encounters that I have while I'm at sea but more and more frequently these days and seen Terrible Things underwater as well things that I don't think most people realize and I've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues to tell him we're complete story I want people to see what's happening underwater both the horror and the magic. first story that I did for National Geographic where I recognize the ability to include environmental issues within a natural history coverage was a story I proposed on harp seal know the story I wanted to do initially was just a small Focus to look at the few weeks each year where these animals migrate down from the Canadian Arctic to the Gulf of st. Lawrence and Canada to engage in courtship meeting and to have their pops and all this is played out against the backdrop of transient pack ice that moves with wind and tide and because I'm an underwater photographer I wanted to do this story from both above and below to me pictures like this the show one of these little pups making it very first swim in the icy 29�� water what is I got more involved in the story I realized that there were two big environmental issues I couldn't ignore the first was at these animals continue to be hunted killed with hakapik said about 8:15 days old it actually is the largest marine mammals water on the planet with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year but it's disturbing is that is I think. problem for harp seals is the loss of sea ice due to global warming is an aerial picture that I made that shows the Gulf of st. Lawrence string harp seal season and even though we see a lot of ice in this picture that's a lot of water as well which wasn't there historically in the ice that is there is quite thin the problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice in order to nurse from their moms they only need 12 days from the moment they're born until they're on their own but if they don't get 12 days they can fall into the ocean and die is a photo that I made showing one of these pups it's only about five or seven days old still has a little bit of the umbilical cord and its belly that has fallen in because of the thin ice and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe and to get it back to stable purchase this problem has continued to grow each year since I was there I read that last year the pup mortality rate was 100% in parts of the Gulf of st. Lawrence who clearly this species has a lot of problems going forward this ended up becoming a cover story at National Geographic can't receive quite a bit of attention and with that I saw the potential to begin doing other stuff. about ocean problems so I proposed the story on the global fish prices in part because I have personally witnessed a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last 30 years but also because I read a scientific paper it stated that 90% of the big fish in the ocean have disappeared in the last fifty or sixty years these are the tune of the bill fish in the Sharks and when I read that I was blown away by those numbers I thought this was going to be headline news and every media outlet but it really wasn't so I wanted to do a story that was a very different kind of underwater story I wanted it to be more like War photography where I was making hard-hitting pictures that showed readers what was happening to Marine Wildlife around the planet the first component of the story that I thought was essential however was to give readers a sense of appreciation for the ocean animals that they were eating and I think people go in a restaurant and somebody orders a steak and we all know where State comes from and somebody orders a chicken and we know what a chicken is but when they're eating Blue Fin Sushi Do they have any sense of The Magnificent animal that they're consuming. and these are the Lions and Tigers of the sea in reality these animals have no terrestrial counterparts are unique in the world these are animals that can practically swim from the equator to the poles and can crisscross entire oceans in the course of the year if we went to a fishing and catching them because they grow their entire life would have 30 year old blue thin out there that weigh a ton for the truth is were way too efficient at catching them and their stocks of collapsed worldwide which of the daily auction at this key key Fish Market that I photographed a couple years ago and every single day these tuna Bluefin like this are stacked up like cordwood just Warehouse after Warehouse in as I wandered around and made these pictures it's would have occurred to me that the ocean is not a grocery store I know we can't keep taking without expecting serious consequences as a result. also with the story wanted to show readers how fish are caught some of the methods that are used to catch fish like a bottom trailer which is one of the most common methods in the world this is a small in that that was being used in Mexico to catch shrimp the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world you have a a large net in the Middle with two steel doors on either end and as this assembly is told through the water the doors meet resistance with the ocean and it opens the mouth of the replacement floats at the top and a LED line on the bottom and it's just drags over the bottom this case to catch shrimp but as you can imagine it's catching everything else in his past as well and it's destroying that precious Bentley community on the bottom things like sponges and coral is that critical habitat for other animals as photographed I made of the fisherman holding the shrimp that he caught after telling his nets for 1 hour so we had a handful of maybe seven or eight shrimp and all those other animals on the deck of the boat or by catch these are animals that died in the process but have no commercial value so this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner maybe seven or eight shrimp and 10 lb. what other animals that have to die in the process and to make that point even more visual I swam Under The Shrimp Boat and made this picture of the guy shoveling this bycatch into the sea is trashed and photographed this Cascade of death you do animals like guitar fish and bat Rays flounder puffer fish that only an hour before we're on the bottom of the ocean of life and now being thrown back is trash to focus on the shark fishing industry because currently on planet Earth worth killing over 100 million sharks every single year but before I went out to photograph this component I should have wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers you know I think there's still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark but this one morning I jumped in and found this treasure that had just recently died in a gill net and with its huge pectoral fins and I still very visible it struck me as sort of a crucifixion if you will thus ended up being the lead picture in the global Fisheries story and National Geographic and I hope that it helps readers to take notice of this problem of 100 million. because I love sharks I'm somewhat obsessed with sharks I wanted to do another more celebratory story about sharks as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation so I went to the Bahamas because there's a very few places in the world where sharks are doing well these days but the Bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy largely due to the fact that the government there had outlawed long-lining several years ago and I wanted to show several species that we hadn't showed much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations one of the locations of this place called tiger beach in the northern Bahamas where tiger sharks aggregating Shallowater this is a low-altitude photographs that I made showing her diaper with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks were just swimming around behind but the one thing I definitely didn't want to do with this coverage was to continue to portray sharks is something like Monsters I didn't want them to be overly threatening or scary and with this photograph of a beautiful 15 ft by 14 ft I guess female tiger shark I sort of think I got to that goal was she was swimming with. little bar jacks off her nose and my strobe created a shadow on her face and I think it's a gentler picture little less threatening little more respectful of the species I also searched on this story for the great Hammerhead minimal it really hadn't been photographed much until about maybe 7 or 10 years ago the very solitary creature but this is an animal is considered data deficient by science in both Florida and in the Bahamas and we know almost nothing about them we don't know where they migrated to or from where they made where they have their pups and yet Hammerhead populations in the Atlantic have declined about 80% in the last twenty or thirty years he was losing them faster than we can possibly find them this is the Oceanic whitetip shark an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species if you pay attention to such list but it's an animal that's about 98% in Decline throughout most of it's strange because this is a pelagic animal that lives out in the deeper water and because we weren't working in the bottom I brought along a shark cage here and my friend shark biologist West Pratt is inside the cage. you see that the photographer course was not inside the cage hear so clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer I guess and lastly with this story I also wanted to focus on baby shark shark nurseries and I went to the island of Bimini in the Bahamas to work with lemon shark pups this is a photo of a lemon shark puppy and shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives in these protective mangroves this is a very sweet upon shark like photograph it's not what you typically might think of is a shark picture but now here we see a shark that's maybe 10 or 11 in Long swimming in about a foot of water but this is crucial habitat is where they spend the first two three years of a lies until they're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef after I left them in the actually learned that this habitat was being bulldozed to create a new golf course and Resort. and other recent stories have looked at single Flagship species if you will that are at risk in the ocean is a way of talking about other threats one such story I did documented the leatherback sea turtle this is the largest widest ranging deepest diving and oldest of all turtle species here we see a female crawling out of the ocean under Moonlight in the island of Trinidad these are animals whose lineage dates back about a hundred million years and it was a time and their lifespan where they were coming out of the water to Nest inside Tyrannosaurus Rex running by and today they crawl out and see Condominiums but despite this amazing longevity they are now considered critically endangered in the Pacific where I met this Photograph their stocks have declined about 90% in the last 15 years this is a photograph that shows a hatchling about to take salt water for the very first time beginning this long and perilous Journey Only One in a thousand leatherback hatchlings will reach maturity but that's due to Natural Predators like vultures that. pick them off on a beach or predatory fish there waiting offshore Nature has learned to compensate with that and females have multiple clutches of eggs to overcome those on what they can't deal with is the answer for Genex dresses human things like this picture that shows a leatherback hot at night in a gill net actually jumped in and photograph this and with the fisherman's permission I cut the turtle out it was able to swim free but you know thousands of other leatherback sea cheer and not so fortunate in the species future is in great danger another charismatic megafauna species that I worked with his a story I did on the right well essentially the story is this with right whales in about a million years ago there was one species of right well on the planet but it is land masses move around in Ocean's became isolated the species sort of separated and today we have essentially two distinct stocks we have the southern right whale that we see here in the North Atlantic right whale and we see here the mom and cap off the coast of Florida and both species were hunted to the brink of Extinction by the early Whalers. but the southern right whales have rebounded a lot better because they are located in place is further away from human activity the North Atlantic white whale is listed as the most endangered species of whale on the planet today because they are Urban Wells they live along the east coast of North America United States and Canada and they have to deal with all these Urban ills this photo shows up and animal popping his head out at Sunset off the coast of Florida you can see the coal burning plant in the background to deal with things like toxins in Pharmaceuticals that are flushed out into the ocean and maybe even affecting their reproduction they also get entangled in fishing gear this is the picture that shows the tail of a right well and those White markings are not Natural Markets these are entangling scars 72% of the population has such scars but most don't shed the gear things like lobster traps and crab pots they hold on to them and eventually kills them and the other problem is they get hit by ships and this was an animal that was struck by a ship and Nova Scotia Canada being towed in where they did a necropsy to confirm the cause of death which was indeed a ship strike. these ills are stacking up to against these animals and keeping their numbers very low and to draw contrast with that beleaguered North Atlantic population I went to a new pristine population of Southern right whales that had only been discovered about 10 years ago in the southern Antarctic of New Zealand please call the Auckland Islands I went down in the winter time and these are animals that have never seen humans before and I was one of the first people to a pride ever seen I got in the water with him and I was amazed at how curious they were this Photograph shows my assistant standing on the bottom of that 70 ft and one of these amazingly beautiful 45 ft 70 ton weigh like a city bus to swimming up you know they were in perfect condition very fat and healthy robust no entanglements cars the way that they are supposed to look when I read that the pilgrims when they landed at Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts in 1620 wrote that you can walk across Cape Cod Bay on the back of right whales and we can't go back and see that today but maybe we can preserve what we have left and I wanted to close this program with a story of Hope a story I did on Marine reserve. to sort of a solution to the problem of overfishing global fish prices story I said all done working in the country of New Zealand because the Zealand was rather Progressive and is rather Progressive Insurance of protecting their ocean and I really want to destroy to be about three things I wanted it to be about abundance of that diversity and about resilience and one of the first places I worked was a reserve called Goat Island in lie of New Zealand what the scientists are told me was it when they protected this first Marine reserve in 1975 they hoped and expected that certain things might happen for example they hope that certain species of fish like the New Zealand Snapper would return because I have been fish to the brink of commercial Extinction and they did come back but they couldn't predict was that other things would happen for example these fish for date on sea urchins and when the fish were all gone all anyone ever saw underwater was just acres and Acres of sea urchins but when the fish came back and begin for dating and controlling the Urgent population lo and behold kelp forest emerged in shallow. and that's because the urchins eat kelp so when the fish control the rich in population the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium you know this is probably how the ocean looked here one or two hundred years ago but nobody was around to tell us I worked in other parts of New Zealand as well and beautiful fragile protected areas like in fiordland where this sea pen colony was founded little blue Cod swimming in for dash of color and in the northern part of New Zealand I do than the Blue Water where the waters little warmer and photographed animals like this giant stingray swimming through an underwater canyon every part of the ecosystem in this place seems very healthy from tiny little animals like a nudibranch calling over and crusting sponge or a leather jacket that is a very important animal in this ecosystem because it freezes on the bottom and allows New Life to take home and I want to finish with this photograph of the picture I made my very stormy day in New Zealand when I just laid on the bottom I missed a school of fish whirling around me and I was in a place that had only been. affected about 20 years ago and I talked to divers that have been diving there for many years and they said that the marine life was better here today than it was in the 1960s and that's because it's been protected that it has come back so I think the message is clear the ocean is indeed resilient and tolerant to a point but we must be good custodians and I became an underwater photographer because I fell in love with the c and a big pictures of it today because I want to protect it and I don't think it's too late thank you very much,0.8033854365348816,
75,BruceBuenodeMesquita_2009.sph.wav,what they will do and if you engineer what they do you can change the world you can get a better result i would like to leave you with one thought i don't predict stock markets ok it's not going up any time really soon but i'm not engaged in doing that which is for me the dominant theme of this gathering and is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world when people say to you with i don't know how to do it thank you i got very nervous halfway through the talk though just panicking whether you'd included in your model the possibility that putting this prediction out there might change the result we've got eight hundred people in thought about that since i've done a lot of work for the intelligence community they've also pondered that it would be a good thing if people paid more attention took seriously and engaged in the same sorts of calculations because it would change things but it would change things in two beneficial ways it would hasten how quickly people arrive at an agreement and so it would save everybody a lot of grief and time i'm not engaged in predicting random number generators i actually get to say people of iran this is your destiny lets go there well people of iran this is what many of you are going to evolve to want and we could get there a lot sooner and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end and the world would be a better place here 's hoping they phone calls from people who want to know what lottery numbers are going to win i don't have a clue i engage in the use of game theory game theory is a branch of mathematics and that means sorry that even in the study of politics math has come the picture we can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics we need to look at this in a rigorous way now what is game theory about it assumes that people are looking out for what's good for them that doesn't seem terribly shocking although it's controversial for a lot of people that we are self interested in order to look out for what's best for them or what they think is best for them and they face limitations constraints they may be weak they may be located in the wrong part of the world they may be einstein away farming someplace in a rural village in india not being noticed as was the case for ramanujan for a long time a great mathematician but nobody noticed i'm going to try to do is explain to you quickly how to predict and illustrate it with some predictions about what iran is going to do in the next couple of years who is rational a lot of people are worried about what is rationality about people are rational mother theresa she was rational i think there are only two exceptions that i'm aware of two year olds they are not rational they have very fickle preferences they switch what they think all the time and schizophrenics are probably not rational but pretty much everybody else is rational that is they are just trying to do what they think is in their own best now in order to work out what people are going to do to pursue their interests we have to think about who has influence in the world if you're trying to influence corporations to change their behavior with regard to producing pollutants you would like it to have but if you show them that it's in their interest then they're responsive so we have to work out who influences problems if we're looking at iran the president of the united states we would like to think may have some influence certainly the president in iran has some influence doesn't know much about iran or about energy policy or about health care or about any particular policy that person surrounds himself or herself with advisers if we're talking about national security it's the secretary of state maybe it's the secretary of defense the director of national intelligence maybe the ambassador to the united nations or somebody else who they think is going to know more about the in order to predict effectively we need to use science and the reason that we need to use science is because then we can reproduce what we're doing it's not just wisdom or guesswork problem but lets face it the secretary of state doesn't know much about iran the secretary of defense doesn't know much about iran each of those people in turn has advisers who advise them so they can advise the president there are lots of people shaping decisions and so if we want to predict correctly we have to pay attention to everybody who is trying to shape the outcome not just the people at the pinnacle of the decision making pyramid a lot of times we don't do that there's a good reason that we don't do that and there's a good reason that using game theory and computers we can overcome the limitation of just looking at a few people imagine a problem with just five decision makers imagine for example that sally over here wants to know what harry and jane and george and frank thinking and sends messages to those people sally 's giving her opinion to them and they're giving their opinion to sally but sally also wants to know what harry is saying to these three and what they're saying to harry and harry wants to know what each of those people are saying to each other and so on and sally would like to know what harry thinks those people are saying that's a complicated problem that's a lot to know with five decision makers there are a lot of linkages one hundred and twenty as a matter of fact if you remember your factorials five factorial is one hundred and twenty that mean we've doubled the number of pieces of information we need to know from one hundred and twenty to two hundred and forty no how about ten times but computers they can they don't need coffee breaks they don't need vacations they don't need to go to sleep at night and if we can predict then we can engineer the future so if you are concerned to influence energy policy or you are concerned to influence national security policy why should we believe what he 's saying so i'm going to show you a factoid this is an assessment by the central intelligence agency of the percentage of time that the model i'm talking about is right in predicting things whose outcome is not yet known when the experts who provided the data inputs got it wrong that's not my claim that's a cia claim you can read it it was declassified a while ago you can read it in a volume edited by h bradford westerfield yale university press so what do we need to know in order to predict we do need to know who has a stake in trying to shape the outcome of a decision we need to know what they say they want that is how willing are they to drop what they're doing when the issue comes up and attend to it instead of something else that's on their plate how big a deal is it to them and how much clout could they bring to bear if they chose to on the issue if we know those things we can predict their behavior by assuming that everybody cares about two things on any decision they care about the outcome they'd like an outcome as close to what they are interested in as possible they're careerists they also care about getting credit there's ego involvement they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome or as important if it's their druthers to block an outcome and so we have to figure out how they balance those two things different people trade off going down in a blaze of glory or giving it up putting their finger in the wind and doing whatever they think is going to be a winning position most people fall in between and if we can work out where they fall we can work out how to negotiate with them or health policy or education science and a particular branch of science is a way to do it not the way we've been doing it which is seat of the pants wisdom to change their behavior so with just that little bit of input we can work out what the choices are that people have what the chances are that they're willing to take what they're after what they value what they want and what they believe about other people you might notice what we don't need to know no history in here how they got to where they are may be important in shaping the input information but once we know where they are we're worried about where they're going to be headed in the future how they got there turns out not to be terribly critical in predicting i remind you of that ninety percent accuracy rate so where are we going to get this information we can get this information from the internet from the economist the financial times the new york times u s news and world report lots of sources like that or we can get it from asking experts who spend their lives studying places and problems because those experts know this information if they don't know who are the people trying to influence the decision how much clout do they have how much they care about this issue and what do they say they want are they experts that's what it means to be an expert that's the basic stuff an expert needs to know turn to iran let me make three important predictions you can check this out iran going to do about its nuclear weapons program how secure is the theocratic regime in iran what's its future and everybody 's best friend now before i get into how to do it let me give you a little truth in advertising because i'm not engaged in the business of magic things going for him how are things going to be working out for him in the next year or two you take a look at this this is not based on statistics i want to be very clear here i'm not projecting some the dynamics of interaction and these are the simulated dynamics the predictions about the path of policy so you can see here on the vertical axis i haven't shown it all the way down to zero there are lots of other options but here i'm just showing you it would achieve some national pride but not go ahead and build a weapon and down at one hundred they would build civilian nuclear energy which is what they say is their objective the yellow line shows us the most likely path the yellow line includes an analysis of eighty seven decision makers in iran and a vast number of outside influencers trying to pressure iran there are lots of thing that the approach i take can predict and there are some that it can 't it can predict changing its behavior various players in the united states and egypt and saudi arabia and russia european union japan so on and so forth the white line reproduces the analysis if the international environment just left iran to make its own internal decisions under its own domestic political pressures that's not going to be happening but you can see the line comes down faster if they're not put under international pressure if they're allowed to pursue their own devices but in any event by the end of this year beginning of next year we get to a stable equilibrium outcome and that equilibrium is not what the united states would like but it's probably an equilibrium that the united states can live with and that a lot of others can live with and that is that iran will achieve that nationalist pride making enough weapons grade fuel through research so that they could show that they know how to make weapons grade fuel but not enough to actually build a bomb how is this happening over here you can see this is the distribution of power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today this is what that power block is predicted to be like by the late parts of two thousand and ten early parts of two thousand and eleven out here today there are a bunch of people ahmadinejad for example who would like not only to build a bomb but test a bomb that power disappears completely nobody supports that by two thousand and eleven these guys are all shrinking the power is all drifting over here so the outcome is going to be the weapons grade fuel who are the winners and who are the losers in iran take a look at these guys they're growing in power and by the way this was done a while ago before the current economic crisis and that's probably going to get steeper these are the moneyed interests in iran the bankers the oil people the bazaaries they are growing in political clout as the are isolating themselves with the exception of one group of mullahs who are not well known to americans that's this line here growing in power much of what has to do with business but sorry if you're looking to speculate in the stock market these are what the iranians call the quietists these are the ayatollahs mostly based in qom who have great clout in the religious community have been quiet on politics and are going to be getting louder because they see iran going in an unhealthy direction a direction contrary to what khomeini had in mind player in iran he is on the way down ok so i'd like you to take a little away from this everything is not predictable the stock market is at least for me not predictable but most complicated negotiations are predictable again whether we're health policy education environment energy litigation mergers all of these are complicated problems that are predictable that this sort of technology can be applied to the reason that being able to predict those things is important is not just because you might run a hedge fund and make money off of it but because if you can predict what people will do you,1,"but I'm going to try to do is explain to you quickly how to predict and illustrate it with some predictions about what Aaron is going to do in the next couple of years. in order to predict effectively we need to use science and the reason that we need to use science is because then we can reproduce what we're doing it's not just wisdom more guesswork and if we can predict then we can engineer the future so if you are concerned to influence energy policy or you are concern to influence national security policy or health policy or education science in a particular branch of science is a way to do it not the way we've been doing it with the seat-of-the-pants wisdom now before I get into how to do it let me give you a little truth in advertising because I'm not engaged in the business of magic. there are lots of things that the approach I take can predict and there are some that it can't it can't predict complex negotiations or situations involving coercion that is an Essence everything that has to do with politics much of what has to do with business but sorry if you're looking to speculate in the stock market I don't predict stock markets okay it's not going up any time really soon. But I'm not in that I'm not engaged in doing that I'm not engaged in predicting random number generator is I actually get phone calls from people who want to know what lottery numbers are going to win I don't have a clue. engage in the use of Game Theory Game Theory is a branch of mathematics and that means sorry that even in the study of politics has come into the picture we can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics we need to look at this in a rigorous way now what is game theory about it assumes that people are looking out for what's good for them that doesn't seem terribly shocking all those controversial for a lot of people that we are self-interested. in order to look out for what's best for them or what they think is best for them people have values identify what they want what they don't want and they have beliefs about what other people want what other people don't want how much power other people have how much those people could getting get in the way of what whatever it is that you want and they face limitations constraints they may be weak they may be located in the wrong part of the world they may be Einstein stuck away farming someplace in a rural Village in India not being noticed as was the case for ramanuja in for a long time and right method nobody noticed. who is rational a lot of people worried about what is rationality about what if young people aren't really rational Mother Teresa she was rational. terrorists their rationale. pretty much everybody is rational I think they're only two exceptions that I'm aware of two-year-old they are not rational they have very fickle preferences they switched what they think all the time and schizophrenic so probably not rational but pretty much everybody else is rational it is they're just trying to do what they think is in their own best interest now in order to work out what people are going to do to pursue their interests we have to think about who has influence in the world if you're trying to influence corporations to change their behavior with regard to producing pollutants one approach, an approach is to exhort them to be better to explain to them what damage they're doing to the planet and many of you may have noticed that doesn't have as big an effect as perhaps you would like it to have but if you show them that it's in their interest. well then they're responsive so we have to work out who influences problems if we're looking at a Ron the president of the United States we would like to think may have some influence certainly the president in Iran has some influence but we make a mistake if we just pay attention to the person at the top of the power ladder because that person doesn't know much about the wrong or about energy policy or about health care about any particular policy that person surrounds himself or herself with advisers if we're talking about national security problem maybe it's the Secretary of State maybe it's the Secretary of Defense the Director of National Intelligence may be the ambassador to the United Nations or somebody else who they think they're going to know more about the particular problem but let's face it the Secretary of State doesn't know much about her on the Secretary of Defense doesn't know much about a r on each of those people in turn. have advisers who advise them so they can advise the president through a lots of people shaping decisions and so if we want to predict correctly we have to pay attention to everybody who is trying to shape the outcome not just the people at the Pinnacle of the decision-making pyramid unfortunately a lot of times we don't do that there's a good reason that we don't do that there's a good reason that using Game Theory and computers we can overcome the limitation of just looking at a few people imagine a problem with just five decision-makers imagine for example that's a lie over here wants to know what Harry and Jane and George and Frank are thinking and sends messages to those people that's all he's giving her opinion to them and they're giving their opinion to Sally but Sally also wants to know what Harry is saying to these three. what they're saying to Harry and Harry wants to know what each of those people are saying to each other and so on its Ally would like to know what Harry thinks those people are saying. play the problem that's a lot to know with five decision-makers there a lot of linkages 120 is a matter of fact if you remember your factorials 5 factorial is 120 not you may be surprised to know the smart people can keep 120 things straight in their head suppose we double the number of influencers from 5 to 10. does that mean we've doubled the number of pieces of information we need to know from 120 to 240 now how about 10 times to 12:00 know we've increased it to 3.6 million. nobody can keep that straight in their head but computers. they can they don't need coffee breaks they don't need vacations they don't need to go to sleep at night they don't ask for reasons either they can keep this information straight and that means that we can process the information so I will talk to you about how to process and I'm going to give you some examples out of the wrong and you're going to be wondering why should we listen to the sky why should we believe what he's saying so I'm going to show you a factoid this is an assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency of the percentage of time that the model I'm talking about is right in predicting things whose outcome is not yet known. when the experts Who provided the data inputs got it wrong. that's not my claim the CIA claim you can read it was Declassified a while ago I can read it in the volume edited by H Bradford Westerfield Yale University press so what do we need to know in order to you may be surprised to find out we don't need to know very much we do need to know who has a steak and trying to shape the outcome of a decision. we need to know what they say they want not what they want in their heart of hearts not what they think they can get but what they say they want because that's a strategically chosen position and we can work backwards from that to draw inferences about important features of their decision making we need to know how focused they are on the problem at hand that is how willing are they to drop what they're doing when the issue comes up and attend to it instead of something else it's on their plate how big a deal is it to them and how much clout could they bring to bear if they chose to engage on the issue. if we know those things we can predict their behavior by assuming that everybody cares about two things on any decision they care about the outcome they like and I'll come as close to what they are interested in this possible the career is they also care about getting credit there's ego involvement they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome or as important if it's Brothers to block an outcome it so we have to figure out how they balance those two things different people trade-off between standing by their outcome Faithfully holding to a going down in a blaze of glory or giving it up putting their finger in the wind and doing whatever they think is going to be a winning position most people fall in between if we can work out where they fall we can work out how to negotiate with them to change their behavior. so it's just a little bit of input we can work out what the choices are the people have what the chances are that they're willing to take what they're after what they value what they want and what they believe about other people you might notice what we don't need to know. there's no history in here how they got to where they are may be important in shaping the input information but once we know where they are we're worried about where they going to be headed in the future and where the hell they got their turns out not to be terribly critical in predicting I remind you that 90% accuracy rate so where we going to get this information we can get this information from the internet from The Economist the financial times the New York Times US News & World Report lots of sources like that or we can get it from asking experts who spend their lives studying places and problems because those experts know this information if they don't know who are the people trying to influence the decision how much clouds do they have how much they care about this issue and what they say they want are the experts that's what it means to be an expert that's the basic stuff and expert needs to know. alright let's turn to a Ron Lee make three important predictions you could check this out time will tell what's wrong going to do about its nuclear weapons program. how secure is the Theocratic regime in Iran what's its future. and everybody's best friend Ahmadinejad how things going for him how things going to be working out for him in the next year or two. you take a look at this this is not based on statistics I want to be very clear I'm not projecting some past data into the future I've taken inputs on positions and so forth run it through a computer model that has stimulated the Dynamics of interaction and these are the simulated Dynamics the predictions about the path of policy so you can see it here on the vertical a sis I haven't shown it all the way down to zero there are lots of other options but him just showing you the prediction so I've narrowed the scale up at the top of the access build a bomb 130 we start somewhere above 130 between building a bomb and make enough weapons-grade fuel so that you could go to bomb that's where according to my analyses the Iranians worth beginning of this year. little model makes predictions down the road at 115 that would only produce enough weapons-grade fuel to show that they know how but they wouldn't build a weapon it would build a research quantity it would have Chiefs of national pride but not go ahead and build a weapon and down a 100 they would build a civilian nuclear energy which is what they say is their objective. the yellow line shows us the most likely path yellow line includes an analysis of 87 decision-makers in a Ron and a vast number of outside influences trying to pressure you run into changing its Behavior various players in the United States in Egypt and Saudi Arabia and Russia are European Union Japan so on and so forth the white line reproduces the analysis is the international environment just left Iran to make its own internal decisions under its own domestic political pressures that's not going to be happening but you can see if a wind comes down faster if they're not put under International pressure if they're allowed to pursue their own devices but in any event by the end of this year beginning of next year we get to a stable equilibrium outcome in that equilibrium is not what the United States would like but it's probably the equilibrium that the United States can live with him. A lot of others can live with and that is that Iran will achieve that National. pride by making enough weapons-grade fuel to research so that they could show that they know how to make weapons-grade fuel but not enough to actually build a bomb. how is this happening so over here you can see this is the distribution of power in favor of Civilian nuclear energy today this is what that PowerBlock is predicted to be like by the white parts of 2010 early parts of 2011. just about nobody supports research and weapons-grade fuel today but by 2011 that gets to be a big block and you put these two together that's the controlling influence in her on out here today there are a bunch of people I'm a dinner job for example would like not only to build a bomb but test a bomb that power disappears completely nobody supports that by 2011 these guys are all shrinking the power is all drifting over here so the outcome is going to be the weapons-grade fuel. who are the winners and the losers in Tehran take a look at these guys are growing in power and by the way this was done awhile ago before the current economic crisis and that's probably going to get Steve these folks are the moneyed interests in Iran the bankers the oil people the bizarre he's they're growing and political clout as the mullahs are isolating themselves with the exception of one group of mullahs who are not well-known to Americans that's just lying here growing in power these are what the orions call the quietest these are the Ayatollah has mostly based in whom you have great clout in the religious community have been quiet on politics and they're going to be getting louder because they see a Ron going in an unhealthy direction to Direction contrary to what Khomeini had in mind. is mr. Ahmadinejad two things to notice he's getting weaker and while he gets a lot of attention in the United States he is not a major player in a row and he's on the way down. okay so I'd like you to take a little away from this everything is not predictable the stock market is that least for me not predictable but most complicated negotiations are predictable again whether we're talkin Health policy education environment energy litigation mergers or these are complicated problems that are predictable that this sort of Technology can be applied to. and the reason that being able to predict those things is important is not just because you might want to hedge fund and make money off of it but because if you can predict what people will do you can engineer what they will do and if you engineer what they do you can change the world you can get a better result so I would like to leave you with one thought which is for me the dominant theme of this Gathering and is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world when people say to you. that's impossible you say back to them when you say that's impossible you're confused. with I don't know how to do it thank you. how much is it. that was that was fast I love that you put it out there to the toilet though just kind of came out that might change the result of 800 people in Tehran to watch TED talks for the muscle ponder that it would be a good thing if people paid more attention took seriously and engaged in the same sorts of calculations that it would change things but it would change things into beneficial ways it would hasten on how how quickly people arrive at an agreement in and so it would save everybody a lot of grief and time and it would arrive at an agreement that everybody was happy with without having to manipulate them so much I which is basically what I do I'm in if you like them so it will be a good thing. set up a run this is your destiny let's go then this is what many of you will go to evolve to want and we could get there a lot sooner and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end and the world would be a better place he was helping me hear it that way because I do",0.7890625,
76,BruceFeiler_2010P.sph.wav,and every seven sets of seven years the land gets an extra year of rest during which time all families are reunited and people surrounded with the ones they love year is called the jubilee year and it's the origin of that term and though i'm shy of fifty it captures my own experience my lost year was my jubilee year by laying fallow i planted the seeds for a healthier future and was reunited with the ones i love the one year anniversary of my journey i went to see my surgeon doctor john healey and by the way healey great name for a doctor he 's the president of the international society of limb salvage which is the least euphemistic term i've ever heard and i said doctor healey if my daughters come to you one day and say what should i i would tell them what i know and that is everybody dies but not everybody lives as i looked at this list to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living i realized we may have done it for our girls but it really changed us and that is the secret of the council of dads is that my wife and i did this in an attempt to help our daughters but it really changed us so i stand here today as you see now walking without crutches or and last week i had my eighteen month scans wrote a series of books about my travels including walking the bible i hosted a television show by that name on pbs i was for all the world the walking guy say can never find a solution for scan xiety as i was going there i was wondering what would i say depending on what happened here heard about our story and very quickly in a span of three weeks put the full resources of twenty three andme and we announced an initiative in july to get to decode the genome of anybody a living person with a heart tissue bone sarcoma and she told me last night in the three months since we've done it we've gotten three hundred people who 've contributed to this program and the epidemiologists here will tell you that's half the number of people who get the disease in one year in the united states so if you go to twenty three andme or if you go to councilofdads com you can click on a link and we encourage anybody been talking about by leaving you with this message and take a long slow walk until in may two thousand and eight a routine visit to my doctor and a routine blood test produced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number that something might be wrong with my bones and my doctor on a whim sent me to get a full body bone scan which showed that there was some growth in my left leg that sent me to an x ray then to an mri and one afternoon i got a call from my doctor the tumor in your leg is not consistent with a benign tumor i stopped walking and it took my mind a second to convert that in the same place in my body as the accident thirty eight years earlier it seemed like too much of a coincidence i was four years old and my family moved to a new neighborhood in our hometown of savannah georgia and this was the nineteen sixties when actually all the streets in this neighborhood were named after confederate war generals so that afternoon i went back to my house and my three year old identical twin daughters eden and tybee feiler came running to meet me they'd just turned three and they were into all things pink and purple in fact we called them pinkalicious and purplicious although i must say our favorite nickname occurred on their birthday april fifteenth when they were born at six fourteen and six forty six on april fifteen aisles i might not walk down they wonder who i was i thought would they yearn for my approval my love my voice few days later i woke with an idea of how i might give them that voice i would reach out to six men from all parts of my life and ask them to be present in the passages of my daughters lives i believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives i wrote these men they 'll have loving families and welcoming homes but they may not have me they may not have their dad will you help be their dad in this culture i don't have to tell you that you sort of happy your way through a problem we should focus on the positive my wife as i said she grew up outside of boston she's got a big smile she's got a big personality she's got big hair we lived on robert e lee blvd and when i was five my parents gave me an orange schwinn stingray bicycle although she told me recently i can't say she has big hair because if i say she has big hair people will think she's from texas and it's apparently okay to marry a boy from georgia but not to have hair from texas i said look in georgia at least we want to know in arkansas they don't even ask what i didn't tell her is if she said yes you could jump you don't need the thirty day waiting period because you don't need the get to know you session at that point so i wasn't going to tell her about this idea but the next day i couldn't control myself i told her and she loved the idea but she quickly started rejecting my nominees well i love him but i would never ask him for advice so it turned out that starting a council of dads was a very efficient way to find out what my wife really thought of my friends so we decided that we needed a set of rules and we came up with a number and the first one was no family only friends we thought our family would already be there second men only we were trying to fill the dad space in the girls lives and then third sort of a dad for every side we kind of went through my personality and tried to get a dad who represented each different thing it had a swooping banana seat and those ape hanger handlebars that made the rider look like an so what happened was i wrote a letter to each of these men and rather than send it i decided to read it to them in person linda my wife joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals i sort of friend married each of these guys we were in this youth hostel in a castle and i snuck out behind and there was a moat a fence and a field of cows and jeff came up beside me and said so have you ever been cow tipping so before i had a chance to determine whether this was right or not we had jumped the moat we climbed the fence we were tiptoeing through the dung and approaching some poor dozing cow so a few weeks after my diagnosis we went up and then i asked him a question which i ended up asking to all the dads and ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book and that was what 's the one piece of advice you would give to my girls and jeff 's advice was be a traveller not a tourist get off the bus seek out what's different approach the cow so it's ten years from now i said and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad and i'm not here what would you tell them as he talked he had that glint in his eye that i first saw back in holland the glint that says let 's go cow tipping even though we never did tip the cow even though no one tips the cow even though cows don't sleep standing up he said i want to see you back here girls at the end of this experience covered in two weeks after my diagnosis a biopsy confirmed i had a seven inch osteosarcoma in my left femur six hundred americans a year get an osteosarcoma eighty five percent are under twenty one twenty years ago doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped and there was a fifteen percent survival rate room i went through four and a half months of chemo actually i had cisplatin doxorubicin and very high dose methotrexate and then i had a fifteen hour surgery in which my surgeon doctor john healey at memorial sloan kettering hospital in new york took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium and if you did see the sanjay special you saw these enormous screws that they screwed into my pelvis then he took my fibula from my calf cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh where it now lives and what he actually did was he de vascularized it this is a surgery so rare only two human beings have survived and my reward for surviving it was to go back for four more months of chemo it was as we said in my house a lost year and i remember a particular one night that when you told that story of i don't know where you are doctor nuland of william sloane coffin it made me think of it i was in the hospital after i think it was my fourth round of chemo when my numbers went to zero and i had basically no immune system and they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital and anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body and one night i got a call from my mother in law that my daughters at that time three and a half i was hit by a passing sedan absence and i hung up the phone and i put my face in my hands and i screamed this silent scream and what you said doctor nuland i don't know where you are made me think of this today because the thought that came to my mind was that feeling that i had was like a primal scream and what was so striking and one of the messages i want to leave you here with today is the experience as i became less and less human my mangled body flew in one direction my mangled bike flew in the other at that moment i was less and less human i was also at the same time maybe the most human i've ever been and what was so striking about that time was instead of repulsing people i was actually proving to be a magnet for people people were incredibly drawn my wife and i had kids we thought it would be all hands on deck instead it was everybody running the other way and when i had cancer we thought it 'd be everybody running the other way instead it was all hands on deck and when people came to me rather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw i was like a living ghost they were incredibly moved to talk about what was going on in their own lives it is an invitation maybe even a mandate to enter the most vital arenas of human life the most sensitive and the most frightening the ones that we never want to go to but when we do go there we feel incredibly transformed when we do and this also happened to my girls as they began to see and we thought maybe became an ounce more compassionate one of the profound things that happened was this act of actually connecting to all these people and it made me think and i'll just note for the record one word that i've only heard once actually was when we were all doing tony robbins yoga yesterday the one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually is the word friend bruce i said and promptly passed out and no one captures this modern manhood to me more than david black now david is my literary agent he 's about five foot three and a half on a good day standing fully upright in cowboy boots and on kind of the manly male front he answers the phone i can say this i guess because you've done it here he answers the phone yo motherfucker he gives boring speeches about obscure bottles of wine and on his fiftieth birthday he bought a convertible sports car although like a lot of men he 's impatient he bought it on his forty i broke my left femur that day it's the largest bone in your body and spent the next two months in a body cast that went from my chin to the tip of my toe to my right knee and a steel bar went from my right knee to my left ankle but like a lot of modern men he hugs he bakes he leaves work early to coach little league someone asked me if he cried when i asked him to be in the council of dads i was like david cries when you invite him to take a walk he said i don't see the wall and i'm telling you the same don't see the wall you may encounter one from time to time but you've got to find a way to get over it around it or through it but whatever you do don't succumb to it don't give in to the wall my home is not far from the brooklyn bridge and during the year and a half i was on crutches it became a sort of symbol to me so one day near the end of my journey i said come on girls let 's take a walk across the brooklyn bridge we set out on crutches i was on crutches my wife was next to me my girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead because walking was one of the first things i lost i spent most of that year thinking about this most elemental of human acts as my physical therapist likes to say every step is a tragedy waiting to happen you nearly fall with one leg then you catch yourself with the other and the biggest consequence of walking on crutches as i did for a year and a half is that you walk slower you hurry you get where you're going but you get there alone you go slow you get where you're going but you get there with this community you built along the way at the risk of admission i was never nicer than the year i was on crutches two hundred years ago a new type of pedestrian appeared in paris he was called a flaneur one who wanders the arcades and it was the custom of those flaneurs to show they were men of leisure by taking turtles for walks and letting the reptile set the pace and i just love this ode to slow moving and it's become my own motto for my girls take a walk with a turtle behold the world in,1,"microraptor begins when I was 4 years old and my family moved to a new neighborhood in our hometown of Savannah Georgia. this was a 1960s well actually all the streets in this neighborhood were named after Confederate War generals. will it rain Robert E Lee Boulevard by parents gave me an orange Schwinn Sting-Ray bicycle it had a swooping banana seat and those Ape Hanger handlebars that made the rider look like an orangutan. call Ape Hangers On hot rod motorcycles of a 1960s which I'm sure my mom didn't know and one day I was exploring this cul-de-sac I wanted to kind of turnaround get back to that three more quickly so I decided to turn around in this big tree that intersected our neighborhood and where am I was hit by a passing sedan my body fluid One Direction my mangled by clue and the other and I lay on the pavement over over stressing over that yellow line and one of my neighbors came running over Andy Andy how are you doing she said using the name of my older brother. I'm Bruce I said and promptly passed out. I broke my left femur that day it's the largest bone in your body and spent the next two months in a body cast it went from my chin to the tip of my toe to my right knee and a steel bar went to my right knee to my left ankle. and for the next 38 years that accident was the only medically interesting thing that ever happened to me in fact I made a living by walking I traveled around the world and two different cultures but a series of books about my travel including walking the Bible I hosted a television show up by that name on TBS I was for all the world the walking dime until in May 2008 a routine visit to my doctor and a routine blood tests produced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number that something might be wrong with my bones and my doctor sent me to get a full body bone scan would show that there was some growth in my left leg that sent me to an x-ray than to an MRI and one afternoon I got a call from my doctor. the tumor in your leg is not consistent with a benign tumor. I stopped walking and it took my mind a second to convert that double negative into a much more horrifying - I have cancer head to think that the said that the tumor was in the same bone in the same place in my body as the accident 38 years earlier it seemed like too much of a coincidence. I went back to my house and my three year old identical twin daughters eaten and Tybee father came running to meet me pink and purple and pink and purple dishes our favorite nickname occurred on their birthday April 15th when they were born at 6:14 and 6:46 on April 15th 2005 are otherwise Grimm humorless doctor looked at his watch April 15th and late filer. but then the next day that was a really good joke and you're the writer kid laughing with all the Glee in the world. I crumbled. I kept imagining all the walks I might not take with them the art projects I might not mess up the boyfriends I might not scowl at the aisles I might not walk down. but they wonder who I was I thought with a urine for my approval my love my voice. a few days later I woke up with an idea of how I might give them that voice I would reach out to six men from all parts of my life and ask them to be present in the passages of my daughter's life. I believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives I wrote these men to help loving families and welcoming homes but they may not have me they may not have their dad will you help me their dad. and I said to myself I would call this group of men the Council of dads. soon as I have this idea I decided I wouldn't tell my wife okay she's a very upbeat naturally kind of excited person you know this is for the idea in this culture to tell you that way through a problem right we should focus on the positive my wife as I said she grew up outside of Boston got a big smile she's got a big personality that big hair care because by station pet speaker people think she's from Texas and it's apparently okay to marry a boy from Georgia but not tap here from Texas and actually it in her defense if she were here right now she would point out that when we got married in Georgia they were three questions on the marriage certificate license the third of which was are you related. did I look I said look at Georgia Arkansas they don't even ask. I didn't tell her that she said I said yes she could jump you don't need a 30-day waiting. We don't need to get to know you the idea but she quickly started rejecting my nominees. pictures of I love him but I would never ask him for advice so it turned out that starting a council of dads was a very efficient way to find out what my wife really thought of my friend but we decided that we needed and we came up with a number in the first one was no family only friends are family would already be there we were trying to fill the dad space in the girls lives and then my dad for every time I kind of went through my personality and tried to get a dad who represented each different thing rather than read it to them in person when did my wife joke and it was like having six different marriage proposal guide. and the first of these guys was Jeff some on this trip I took to Europe when I graduate from high school in the early 1980s and on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle and I snuck out behind and it was a moat a fence and a field of cows and just came up beside me said so have you ever been counting. I like how to sleep standing up so if you approach them from behind you can put down when you can put them over and they go in the mud. before I had a chance to determine whether this was right or not we had jumped the moat we had climbed the fence we had we were going to the dung and approaching some poor dozing town. after my diagnosis I we went up to Vermont and I decide to put Jeff at the first person in the conflict. Then we went to the apple orchard and I read him this letter will you help you there dad. back at 3 and he was crying and I was crying and they looked at me and he said yes. how about yes I kind of had forgotten there was a question at the heart of my ladder and frankly how do I keep getting asked this and it never occurred to me that anybody would turn me down under the circumstances. and then I asked him a question which I end up asking to all the dads and end up really encouraged me to write the story down in the book and that was what's the one piece of advice you would give to my girls and just advice was being a traveler not a tourist get off the bus seek out with different approach the cow. so it's 10 years from now I said in my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad and I'm not here what would you tell them this journey as a young child might approach a mud puddle you can bend over and look at your reflection in the mirror and maybe going to run your finger and make a small Ripple or you can jump in and see what it feels like what it smells like he had that glint in his eye I first saw back in Holland the clip that says let's go cow tipping even though we never did typical even though no one touch the cow even though I don't sleep standing up. he said I want to see you back your girls at the end of this experience covered in mud. two weeks after my diagnosis a biopsy confirmed I have a 7 inch osteosarcoma in my left femur 600 Americans a year get an osteosarcoma 85% or under 21 only $100 a year get one of these diseases. twenty years ago doctors would have cut off my leg and hope and there's a 15% survival rate. and then the 1980s a determined at one particular cocktail of chemo could be effective and within weeks I have started that regiment and since we are in the medical room I went through four and a half months of chemo doxorubicin and high very high dose Methotrexate and then I had a 15-hour surgery in which my surgeon dr. John Healey at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium and if you did see the Sanjay special you saw these enormous screws to be screwed into my into my pelvis then he took my fibula from my path cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh wear it now lives and what actually he did was he realized it from my task Andre vascularized it in my thigh and then connected it to the good parts of my knee and my hip and then he took out a third of my quadricep muscle. this is a surgery so rare only two human beings have survived it before me. and my reward for surviving it was to go back for four more months of chemo it was in my house a lost year because I'm not opening weeks we all had was walking through my house at my desk and sell photographs of someone else's children sitting on my desk. I don't remember a particular one night that when you pull that store you I don't know where you are stuck in the line of William cop and it made me think of it cuz I was in the hospital with my fourth round of chemo when my numbers went to zero and I had basically no immune system and they put me in an infectious disease ward of the hospital, and anybody who came to see me how to cover themselves in a mask and and cover all the extraneous parts of their body and when I got a call from my mother-in-law that my daughter's at that time three-and-a-half were missing me and feeling my absence. and I hung up the phone and I put my face in my hands and I screamed this Silent Spring. and what you said about the new one I don't know where you are made me think of this today because the thought that came to my mind was it that feeling that I had a primal scream and what was so striking and the one one of the messages I want to leave you with your today is the experience as I became less and less human and at this moment in my life I would probably 30 pounds less than I am right now if I had no hair and no immune system they were actually putting blood inside my body at that moment I was less and less human I was also at the same time most human I've ever been. and what was so striking about that time was instead of repulsing people I was actually proving to be a magnet for people people and cleaned up and drawn with my wife and I have kid we thought it would be all hands on deck with everybody run the other way and when I can so we thought it would be everybody run the other way instead it was all hands on deck and when people came to me rather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw that they were incredibly moved to talk about what was going on in their own lies. cancer I found is a passport to enter me see he doesn't invitation maybe even a mandate to enter the most vital Arenas of human life the most sensitive and the most frightening the ones that we never want to go but when we do go there we feel incredibly transformed when we do. and it's awful happened to my girls as they began to see and we thought maybe two came in the house more compassionate one day my daughter Tybee that even came to type you said to me she died so much love in my body for your daddy I can't stop giving you hugs and kisses and when I have no more love left I just drink milk because that's where love comes from. and what might my daughter even came to me as I lifted my bed my leg out of bed she reached for my crutches and handed them to me if I could clean to one memory of this year we walking down a darkened hallway with five spongy fingers are grasping the handle underneath my hand I didn't need it anymore I was walking on air. one of the profound things that happened with his act and actually connecting to all these people and it made me think I'm a just note for the record that one of the one word I've only heard once actually which one we're all doing Tony Robbins Yo Gotti yesterday that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually is the word friend. can I get from everything we were talking about compliance or addiction or weight loss we now know that Community is important and yet it's one thing that we don't actually bring in and it was something incredibly profound about sitting down with my closest friends and telling them what they meant to me and one of things I learned is that overtime particularly men who would used to be non-communicative hard becoming more and more communicative and there was one in My Life by 50 States this Council of dads and then decide what we were talking about it was like a second mom talked about it school drop-off. and no one captures This Modern manhood to me more than a David black three and a half on a good day standing for the mail from he answer the phone I can say this because of you've done here he answer the phone your mother fucker he gets boring speeches about scary bottles of wine and on his 50th birthday he bought a convertible sports car I don't like a lot of men he's impatient he bought it on his 49th he leaves work early the coach little league someone asked me if he cried when I asked him to be in the Council of dads I was like take a walk. which means he's a broken dreams in a world where most dreams don't come true and this is what we wanted him to capture what it means to have setbacks and aspirations and I said what's the most valuable thing you can give to a dreamer and he said I believe in themselves but when I came to see you I said I didn't believe in myself from time to time you got to find a way to get over it around it or through it but whatever you do don't succumb to it don't give in the wall. my home is not far from the Brooklyn Bridge. during a year-and-a-half I was on crutches it became a sort of symbol to me. so one day near the end of my journey I said come on girl let's take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. we set out on crutches and I was on crutches my wife is next to me my girls were doing these kind of Rockstar poses up ahead. look up walking with one of the first things I lost I spent most of that year thinking about this most Elemental of human acts. walking up right we are told is the threshold of what made us human and yet for the 4 million years humans have been walking upright unchanged as my physical therapist likes to say every step is a tragedy waiting to happen you nearly fall then you catch yourself with the other. and a bit of consequence of walking on crutches I did for a year-and-a-half is it you walk slower. you hurry you get where you're going but you get there alone you go slow you get where you're going till you get there with this community you built along the way. at the risk of admission I was never nicer than the year I was on crutches. 200 years ago a new type of pedestrian appeared in Paris he was called a flinner one who wanders the arcade and it was to show they were men of leisure Turtles for walks and letting the reptile set the pace and I just loved it so just slow moving and it's become my own model for my girls take a walk with a turtle be called the world in pause. and if I deposit may be the single biggest lesson I took from my journey. there's a quote from Moses on the side of the Liberty Bell and it comes from a passage in The Book of Leviticus that every 7 years you should let the land lay fallow and every seven sets of seven years the land gets an extra year of rest during which time our families are reunited and people surrounded with the ones they love. 50th year is called the Jubilee year and is the origin of that term. and do that I'm try to 50 captain my own experience my lost here with my Jubilee year. by lying fallow I planted the seeds for a healthier future and was reunited with the ones they love for the ones I love. tell me one year anniversary of my journey I went to see my surgeon Doctor John Healy by the way he lie right name for a doctor keep the president of the international Society of limb Salvage which is the missing term. can I see a doctor if my daughter has come to you with one day and say what should I learn for my daddy story what would you tell them. should I would tell them what I know and that is everybody dies. but not everybody lives. I want you to live. I wrote a letter to my girl if it appears at the end of my both the Council of dads and I lifted these lessons he was referred here today approached the cow Factor flip flops don't see the Wall Live the questions Harvest miracles. and I want to just left to me was sort of like a sound book a living I realize we have done it for a girls but it really changed us. and that is the secret of the Council of dads is in my wife and I did this an attempt to help our daughters but it really changed us. so I stand here today as you seen that walking without crutches or cane. and last week I had my 18 months can. as you all know anybody with cancer has to get follow-up scans and my case is quarterly and all the collective mind in this room I daresay I can never find a solution first and ziya T. as I was going I was wondering what would I say depending on what happened to you. I got good news that day and I stand here today cancer free walking without age without Aid and hobbling forward. I just want to mention briefly and past my pass my time live by just wanted to briefly mentioned in passing that one of the nice thing is I can come out of a conference like this is there a similar meeting back in the spring and we just heard about our story and very quickly and a span of three weeks put the full resources of 23andMe and we announced an initiative in July to get to decode the Genome of all anybody with a living person with a bone with a heart tissue bone start, and she told me last night in the three months since we've done it we've got 300 people who contributed to this program and the epidemiology of people who get the disease in one year in the United States. if you go to 23andMe if you go to Council of dads., you can click on the link and we encourage anybody to join this afternoon. but I just closed when I'm done talking about my leaving you with this message may you find an excuse to reach out to some long-lost pal to that college roommate or just one person you may have turned away from that you find a mud puddle to jump in some place or find a way to get over around or through any wall that stands between you and one of your dreams. every now and then find a friend find a turtle and take a long slow walk. academic",0.7161458730697632,
77,BruceMcCall_2008P.sph.wav,i work a lot in what i call retrofuturism which is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow and they're always wrong always hilariously optimistically wrong and the peak time for that was the thirties because the depression was so dismal that anything to get away from the present into the future and technology was going to carry us along this is popular workbench popular science magazines in those days i had a huge collection of them from the thirties all they are just poor people being asked to make sunglasses out of wire coat hangers and everything improvised and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots playing ice hockey at three hundred miles an hour it a s all going to happen it a s all going to be wonderful automotive retrofuturism is one of my specialties i was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter so i have a lot of revenge to take on the subject i don't know what the hell i'm doing here my teeth techno archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened for good reason usually the zeppelin this was from a brochure about based obviously on the hindenburg but the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man and it carried fifty six people at the speed of a buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark and it cost twice as much as a first class cabin on the normandie to fly it so the was inevitable it was going to go this is auto gyro jousting in malibu in the thirties the auto gyro couldn't wait for the invention of the helicopter but it should have it wasn't a big success it's the only spanish innovation technologically of the twentieth century by the way needed to know that most useless human emotion so i think that a s a case for serious play this is emblematic of it this is wing dining and i paint on paper using gouache which hasn't changed in six hundred years reading some pages from his new novel to fitzgerald and ford madox ford until the slipstream blows him away this is tank polo in this is the brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody i do a lot of that they had two machine guns and a cannon and they had ninety horsepower ricardo engines they went five miles an hour and inside it was one hundred and five degrees in the pitch dark and they had a canary hung inside the thing to happy little story isn't it this is motor ritz towers in manhattan in the thirties where you drove up to your front door if you had the but about three years ago i had an art show in new york and i titled it serious nonsense so i think i'm actually the first one here fond memory of times past hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit just for the fun of it this was a piece i did a brochure again and it's so safe it carries no insurance but it's not a cri de coeur about man 's hubris in the face of the elements it's just a sick silly joke shamelessly cheap is something i think this will wake you up it has no meaning just desoto discovers the mississippi and that's a desoto discovering the mississippi i did that as a i lead i called it serious nonsense because on the serious side i use a technique of painstaking realism thirty of them are based on that concept i was driving down seventh avenue one night at three a m and this steam pouring out of the street and i thought what causes that and who a s to say the temple of dendur at the metropolitan in new york it's a very somber place i thought i could jazz it up a bit have a little fun with it this is a very un pc cover not in new york i couldn't resist and i got a nasty email from some environmental group saying this is too serious and solemn to make fun of you should be ashamed please apologize on our website haven't got around to it yet i this is the word side of my love the word if you live in new york you know how the bike messengers move except that he 's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff they all do of editorial illustration from when i was a kid i copied it and i never unlearned it it's the only style i know and it's very kind of staid and formal i don't know a hell of a lot about fashion i was told to do what they call a mary jane and then i got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying put a strap on it no don't put a strap on it put a strap on it one letter makes an idea this is a big joke this is the audition for king kong you know that name called me and said she loved the cover it was so sweet her former name was fay wray and so that was i didn't have the wit to say take the painting you can't see it all together unfortunately but if you look at it enough you can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move and meanwhile i use nonsense as you can see this is a scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors and the trick was to bang the golf ball off a suits of armor which you can't see there this was one of a series called zany afternoons which became a book this is a home built rocket propelled would just like to add a crass commercial i have a kids book coming out so thank you very much,1,I don't know what the hell I'm doing here I was born in the Scots Presbyterian ghetto in Canada and dropped out of high school I don't want to sell phone. and I paint on paper using gouache which hasn't changed in 600 years. but about three years ago I had an art show in New York and I titled it serious nonsense so I think I'm actually the first one here I'm I lead I call it serious nonsense because on the serious side I use a technique of painstaking realism of an eternal illustration before when I was a kid I copied it and I never unlearned it it's the only style I know and it's very kind of stayed and formal and meanwhile I use nonsense as you can see this is a Scottish castle where people are playing golf indoor the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor you can't see their this was one of a series called Jenny afternoon which became a book this is a home-built rocket-propelled. car that's a 1953 Henry J I'm a bug drunk intensity in a quiet neighborhood in Toledo this is my submission for the LA Museum of film. you can probably tell Frank gehry and I come from the same time my work is. so personal and so strange that I have to invent my own lexicon for it and I work a lot it would like a retro-futurism which is looking back to see how yesterday due tomorrow and they're always wrong always hilariously optimistically wrong and the peak time for that was the thirties because of depression was so doesn't know that anything to get away from the present into the future as technology was going to carry us along this is Papa. Work was popular science magazines in those days I have a huge collection of them from the thirties all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses out of wire coat hangers and everything that improvised and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots play ice hockey at 300 miles an hour all going to happen so I can be wonderful Automotive retro-futurism is one of my specialties I was both an automobile illustrator and advertising automobile copyright or so I have a lot of Revenge to take. on the subject Detroit has always been halfway into the future of the advertising have this is the 58 V A bill so new they make tomorrow it's like yesterday this is a Chain Gang of guys admiring the car that's from a whole catalog is 18 Pages or so ran back in the days of the Lampoon for I cut my teeth techno Archaeology is digging back and finding past Miracles that never happened for a good reason usually the Zeppelin this was from a brochure about the Zeppelin IV send henneberg but the Zeppelin was. the biggest thing that ever moved made by man and it carry 56 people at the speed of a Buick at an altitude if you hear dogs bark and it cost twice as much as the first class cabin on the Normandy the flyer so the Hindenburg wasn't it was inevitable is going to go this is stick in Malibu in the 30s. the autogyro couldn't wait to leave invention of the helicopter but it should have it wasn't a big success the only Spanish Innovation technologically of the 20th century by the way. you needed to know that. the flying car which never got off the ground was the post-war dream my old man used to tell me you were going to get the flying car this is pitched in the future for 1946 looking at the day all American families have them there's Moscow surely hope they speak Esperanto. phone astrology which I'm certain that's a famous for but I work an awful lot in that it's the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened. somebody once said that Nostalgia is the one out early most useless human emotion so I think that's the case for serious play this is emblematic of it this is when dining. recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over France in the twenties dining on the wing of a plane you can't see it very well here but that's Hemingway reading some pages from his new novel to Fitzgerald and Ford madox Ford until the split screen blows him away this is tank call Owen Southampton this is. the brain was richer more fun to make fun of the anybody I do a lot of that. and authenticity is a is a major part of my serious nonsense I think it adds a huge amount that was her example are marked for British tanks from 1916 they had two machine guns in the Canon of the night her car Ricardo engines they went 5 miles an hour and inside was a hundred and five degrees in the pitch dark and they had a canary hung inside the thing to make sure the Germans were going to give it gas. happy little story live this is Moto Rich towers in Manhattan in the 30s where you drove up to your front door if you had the guts. anybody who is anybody has an apartment there a manager stick into the Zeppelin an ocean liner that was sheer enthusiasm and I love cigars a cigar billboard down there and phone off now it works even even a serious subjects like War this is so those wonderful days of the Battle of Britain in 1940 when I message Matt me-109 burst into the House of Commons and buses around just to piss off her shoulders down there somewhere is a fond memory of times past hyperbolic Overkill is a way of all of them just for the fun of it this was a piece I did a brochure again. RMS Titanic the biggest thing in all the world the copy what you can't see because it is goes on and on for several Pages says the steerage passengers can't get that your bunks before the The Voyage is over it's and it's so safe and Carries no insurance it's obviously modeled on the Titanic but it's no it's not a creative color about man's Hubris in the face of the element it's just a silly joke cheap is something I think it's a wake you up and has no meaning just us out of the sky was the Mississippi and it took the photo. discovering the Mississippi I did that as a quick Backpage I had like four hours to do a back page for an issue is a Lampoon that did that and I thought I'm ashamed I hope nobody knows it for referring to that thing. Urban absurdism that's what the New York are really calls for a ride I try to make life in New York luck even weirder than it is with those covers I've done about 40 other than I'd say Thirty are based on that concept I was driving down 7th Avenue one night to 3 a.m. in this steam pouring out of the street and I thought what causes that. who's to say the Temple of dendur at the Metropolitan in New York the very somber place I thought I could Jazz it up a bit have a little fun with it this is a very on PC cover. it's not in New York I couldn't resist and I got a nasty email from some environmental groups saying this is too serious and solemn to make fun of you should be ashamed please apologize on our website I haven't got around to it yet but. I'm a. this is at the store inside my brain. I love the word eurotrash. that's only retract coming through JFK customs. this was the New York Bike messenger meeting the Tour de France. if your live in New York and you know how the bike Messengers is move except that he's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff they all do and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist or about to shoot rockets in the Tour de France sign of our times I guess this is the only fashion cover I've ever done little lady lives in the shoe and then this thing there. I don't know a lot about sacking I was told to do before they call a Mary Jane and then I got into this terrible fight between our director in the editor saying put a strap out of no don't put a strap on a put a strap on a jump scares the logo and let's terrible it's bad and I finally check it out and did it for the sake of the authenticity of the shoe this is a tiny joke easier pass one letter makes makes an idea. this is a big joke this is. the Edition for King Kong. people always ask me where you get your ideas hunting ideas come true about that one is I had a horrible red wine hangover in the middle of the night just came to me like a Xerox all I had to do is write it down if it was a perfectly clear it didn't do any thinking about it and then when it ran a lovely lady old lady named mrs. Edgar Rosenberg you know that name called me and said she loved the cover it was so sweet of her former name was Fay Wray that was I didn't have the wit to say take the painting. finally this was a three-page cover never done before another letter but then again it's excessive pages in the front of the magazine it's the ascent of man using an escalator and it's in three part. you can't see it all together unfortunately but if you look at it enough you can start to start to see how it actually got the move.pretty elegant. something like a crash to end of. dealt that completes my over. I would much like to add a crass commercial doesn't have a kids book coming out in the fall called Marvel time which is a compendium of all the serious play that ever was and it's going to be available in find book stores from the book stores tables on the streets in October so thank you very much,0.7630208730697632,

79,BurtRutan_2006.sph.wav,whether we're first or not really doesn't matter the russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the concorde and then they flew a few cargo flights and took it out of service i think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered what we're looking forward to already there's about a billion and a half to a billion point seven investment in private space flight that is not government at all already worldwide read if you google it you'll find about half of that money but there's twice of that being committed out there not spent yet but being committed and planned for the next few years what we're looking forward to i'm predicting though as profitable as this industry is going to be and it certainly is profitable when you fly people two hundred thousand dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost or less this is going to be very profitable i predict also that is not only the inspiration of our children but the current plan right now is and every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by factor of ten to fifteen and what that means is before we know the progress in human space flight with no taxpayer dollars will be at a level that is because us it's private industry you should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff and we've done it for a long time the naca before nasa never developed an airliner and never ran an airline but nasa is developing the space liner always has and runs the only space line ok and we've shied away from it because we're afraid of it but starting back in june of two thousand and four not really even when i showed that a little allowing the most creative people in this country the boeing 's and lockheed 's space engineers to go out and take risks and try new stuff we're going to go back to the moon fifty years later and we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new i'm really troubled by that but anyway that's the basis of the thing that i want to share with you today though is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later that's the theme of my next fifteen minutes here and i think that the inspiration begins when you're very young three year olds up to twelve fourteen year olds what we what they look at is the most important thing i want to start off by saying houston we have a problem take a snapshot at aviation and there was a wonderful little short four year time period airplanes were invented by natural selection now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes there probably at least thirty thousand different things tried and when they crash and kill the pilot don't try that again the ones that flew and landed ok because there was no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition so we by making a whole bunch of attempts entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space in fact thousands of attempts in that four year time period we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today and that's why they're so safe as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good that has not happened at all in space flying there's only been two concepts tried two by the u s and one by the russians well who was inspired during that time period aviation week asked me to make a list of who i thought were the movers and shakers of the first one hundred years of aviation and i wrote them down and i found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation well what happened when i was a little kid was some pretty heavy stuff the jet age started the missile age started von braun was on there showing how to go to mars and this was before sputnik and this was at a time when mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now we thought there'd be animals there we knew there were plants there the colors change right but you know nasa screwed that up because they've sent these robots and they've landed it only in the if you look at what happened this little black line is as fast as man ever flew and the red line is a top of the line military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport you notice here 's a big jump when i was a little kid we stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing and i think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try well what did i do when i was a kid i didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and well we didn't have drugs in those days but i did competition model airplanes i spent about seven years during the vietnam war flight testing airplanes for the air force and then i went in and i had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages and some three thousand of these are flying of course one of them is around the world voyager the most impressive airplane ever i believe was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet the most impressive spaceship ever i believe was a grumman lunar lander it was a you know it landed on the moon take off of the moon didn't need any maintenance guys that we as a species have always done and that is instinctively we've gone out and climbed over three years and we can't do that now crazy talk very briefly about innovation cycles things that grow have a lot of activity they die out when they're replaced by something else these things tend to happen every twenty five years forty years long with an overlap you can put that statement on all kinds of different technologies the interesting thing by the way the speed here excuse me higher speed travel is the title of these innovation cycles there is none here here 's the biggie and that is you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it you know a good example of course is the darpa net computers were used for artillery first then irs but when we got it now you have all the level of activity all the benefit from it private sector to do it keep that in mind i put down innovation i've looked for innovation cycles in space and i found the very first year starting when gagarin went in space and a few weeks later alan shepherd there were five manned space flights in the world the very first year in two thousand and three everyone that the united states sent to space was killed there were only three or four flights in two thousand and three in two thousand and four there were only two flights two russian soyuz flights to the international manned station and i had to fly three in mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people this is a picture here taken from spaceshipone this is a picture here taken from orbit our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that we know how to do it for sub orbital flying now do it safe enough at least as safe as the early airlines so that can be done and i think i want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small well first of all what's going to happen next the first industry will be a high volume a lot of players another one announced just last week and it will be sub orbital and the reason it has to be sub orbital is there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit and i feel very strongly that it's not good enough the governments have been doing this three governments have been doing this for forty five years and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died that's you don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety be very high volume we think one hundred thousand people will fly by two thousand and twenty i can't tell you when this will start because i don't want my competition to know my schedule but i think once it does we will find solutions and very quickly you'll see those resort hotels in orbit and that real easy thing to do which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view and that will be really cool because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by ten feet if you want oh it's going to be so much fun for us to have generations of kids that think that it's ok to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it they need to look forward to my critics say hey rutan 's just spending a lot of these billionaires money for joyrides for what's this this is not a transportation system it's just for fun because i could say i got a computer at my house and you don 't what do you use it for come over it does frogger not the banks computer or big development big improvement and capability and so on and they get out there in enough homes we were for a new invention and the inventor is in this audience al gore invented the internet and because of that something that we used for a whole year excuse me a whole decade for fun became everything our commerce our research our communication and if we let the google guys think for another couple weekends we can add a dozen more things to the list and it won 't be very long before you won 't be able to convince kids that we didn't always have computers in our a group of people that have come forward and you don't know all of them but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children this little three to fifteen year old age by us going to orbit and going to the moon here right in this time period paul allen richard branson jeff the ansari family which is now funding the russians sub orbital thing bob bigelow a private space station and these people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area and i think it's a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something but they're putting it in very areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore and i think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct they were inspired by big progress we need to inspire them because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future i'm particularly troubled that what nasa's doing right now with this new bush doctrine to but look at the progress that's going on after that there were a couple of examples here the military fighters had a highest performance military airplane was the sr seventy one it went a whole life cycle got too rusty to fly and was taken out of service the concorde doubled the speed for airline travel it went a whole life cycle without competition took out of service and we're stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late but something is out there to inspire our kids now and i'm talking about if you've got a baby now or if you've got a ten year old now what's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here relatively soon you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest performance military operational airplane it's never happened before the fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been well you know you win the war in twelve minutes why do you need something better but i think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub orbital flights to space very soon wait a minute what's happening here we'll have military fighters with sub orbital capability and i think very soon this but the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first ok i look forward to a new we didn't lose them technically the fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let von braun fly technology and that was a very strong thing and then we flew alan shepherd weeks after gagarin not months or decades or whatever so we had the capability but america lost for this next decade and a half oh shoot i screwed up we have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics well again what's interesting here is we've lost to the russians on the first couple of milestones already you cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in america you can buy it in russia it's commercial it can be defined as space tourism they are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon like apollo eight was done one hundred million bucks go to the moon but you know would you have thought back in the sixties when the space race was going on that the first commercial capitalist like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in russian hardware and would you have thought would the russians have thought that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware the guys inside won 't be russians maybe it'll probably be a japanese or an american billionaire well that's weird you know it really is but anyway i think we need to beat them again i think what we'll do is we'll see a successful very successful private space flight industry,1,"I want to start off by saying Houston we have a problem. we're entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space effectively regressed losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species of always done and that is instinctively we've gone out and climbed over difficult places went to more hostile places and found out later and maybe two are surprised if that's the reason we survived and I feel very strongly that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it's okay to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it they need to look forward to exploration they need to look forward to colonization they need to look forward to breakthroughs they need to we need to inspire them because they need to lead us. help us survive in the future I'm particularly troubled that what NASA is doing right now with this new Bush Doctrine to for this next decade and shoot I screwed up we have real Specific Instructions here not to talk about politics. is what we're looking forward to. is not only the inspiration of our children but the current plan right now is is not really even allowing the most creative people in this country the Boeing's and Lockheed Space Engineers to go out and take risks and try new stuff. we're going to go back to the moon and fifty years later. and we're going to do it very specifically plan to not learn anything new. I'm really troubled by that anyway that's the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today though is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later that's the theme of my next 15 minutes here and I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young. 3 year olds up to 12 14 year olds what we eat what they look at is the most important thing is short for your time. When marvelous things happened started in 1908 when the Wright brothers flew in Paris and everybody said Woo I can do that there's only a few people that have flown in early 1908 in 4 years 30. find Countryside Hunters of airplanes thousands of Pilots airplane was invented by natural selection now you can say that intelligent design designs are airplanes have today but there was no intelligent design really designing those earlier plane there were probably at least thirty thousand different things tried and when they crash and kill the pilot I don't try that again the ones that flew and landed okay cuz there was no train pilots wear had good flying qualities by definition so by making a whole bunch of attempts in that for your time. We invented the concepts of the airplanes we fly today and that's why they're so safe as we gave it a lot of a lot of chance to to find what's good that has not happened at all in space line is only been two concepts tried to buy the us and one by the Russians to make a list of who I thought were the movers and shakers of the first hundred years of. the ocean and I wrote them down when I found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful Renaissance of Aviation well what happened when I was a little kid was so some pretty heady stuff to the jet age started the missile age started Von Braun was on there showing how to go to Mars and this was before Sputnik and this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now we thought there be animals are we knew there were plants there the colors change right but you know NASA screw that up because I sent these robots and they landed it only in the desert. if you look at what happened this is a black line This is as fast as man of her flu and the red line is a top-of-the-line military Fighters and and the blue line is Commercial Air transport you know if there's a big jump when I was a little kid and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people weren't Having the courage to try well what did I do when I was a kid I didn't do the hot rods in the girls in the dance and then why we didn't have drugs in those days but I did competition model airplanes I spent about seven years during the Vietnam war flight testing airplanes for the Air Force and then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their garages and some three thousand of these are flying around the world Voyager I found another company in 82 which which is my company now and we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982. and there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart the most impressive airplane I believe was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet. stating service tell it was too rusty to fly taken out of service we retreated and 98 back to something that was developed in 56 spaceship ever I believe was a groom agreement lunar lunar lander on the moon didn't need any maintenance guys that's kind of cool we've lost that capability we Bandit and 72 this thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961 years. do that now. crazy talk very briefly about Innovation Cycles things that grow have a lot of activity they died out when they replaced by something else these things tend to happen to every 25 years 40 years along with an overlap you can put that that statement on all kinds of different Technologies the interesting thing by the way that the speed Heroes human higher speed travel is the is the title of these Innovation Cycles there is none here these two new airplanes are the same speed as a dc-8 that was done in 1958. here's the biggie and that is you don't have any vacation Cycles if the government develops in the government uses it you know a good example courses that is the arpanet other computers we use for artillery first than IRS but when we got it now you have all the level of activity all the benefit from it private sector has to do it keep that in mind I put down Innovation I thought I'd look for Innovation Cycles in space I found none the very first year starting 12 Garen when in space in a few weeks later Alan Shepard there were five men space flights in the world the very first year. in 2003 everyone that the United States sent to space was killed. there were only three or four flights in 2003 in 2004. there were only two flights to Russian soyuz flights to the international men's station and I had to fly 3 in Mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of 5 which is the number the same here back in 1961. there is no growth there's no activity there's no nothing this is a picture here taken from spaceship one this is a picture here taken from orbit our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that we know how to do it for suborbital flying now do it safe enough at least as safe as the early Airlines so that can be done and I I think that I want to talk a little bit about why we have the courage to go out and and try that as a as a small company. first of all what's going to happen next so first industry will be a high-volume a lot of players does there's another one announced just last week and it will be a suborbital and the reason it has to be suborbital is there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public it to orbit of the governments have been doing this 3 government's been doing this for 45 years and still 4% of the people that have left the atmosphere of died and yet you want to run a business with that kind of a safety record. I'll be very high-volume we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020 I can't tell you when this will start cuz I don't want my competition to know my schedule but I think once it does we will find Solutions and very quickly you'll see those resort hotels in orbit and that really easy thing to do which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool View and that'll be really cool cuz the moon doesn't have an atmosphere you can do an elliptical orbit miss it by 10 ft if you want to it's going to be so much fun. okay my critics say a root and it's just been a lot of these billionaires money to for Joyrides for billionaire what's this is not transportation system is just for fun and I used to be bothered by that and I got to thinking what wait a minute I bought my first Apple computer in 1978. and I bought it because I can say I got a computer at my house and you don't. and what do you use it for come over at does Frogger mean okay. not the bank's computer a lock use computer but the home computer was for games for a Whole Decade it was for fun we didn't even know what it was for but what happened to the fact that we had this big industry big development big Improvement and and capability and so on and in and get out there and enough homes we were ripe for a new invention in the inventor is in this audio to Al Gore invented the internet and because of that what something that we use for a whole year to give me a Whole Decade for fun became everything our Commerce our research our communication and if we let the Google guys think for another couple weekends we can add a dozen more things to the list and I won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids that we didn't always have computers in her home. so fun is defendable okay I want to show you kind of a busy chart but it in it is my prediction with what's going to happen and it also brings up another point right here there's a group of people that have come forward and you don't know all of them but the ones that have come forward we're Inspire as young children this little Lionel 3 to 15 year old age by us going to orbit and go to the Moon here right in this time.. Paul Allen Elon Musk Richard Branson Jeff Bezos. Ali Ansari family which is now funding in the Russians suborbital thing Bob Bill Bigelow a private space station and Carmack these people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area and I think it's a lot better than they put it in the in an area of Vetter cell phone or something but they're putting it in various areas in in this will lead us into this kind of capability and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it allow us to explore and I think eventually allow a suit to colonize in and keep us from going extinct they were inspired by big progress but look at the progress is going on after that there were a couple of examples here the military Fighters had a the highest performance military airplane was the SR-71 it went a whole life cycle got too rusty to fly and was taken out of service the Concorde double the speed for for airline travel. he went a whole life cycle without competition took out of service and we're stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military Fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late fifties but something is out there to inspire our kids now and I'm talking about if you got a baby now or if you got a 10 year old now what's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here. relatively soon you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster then the highest performance military operational airplanes never happened before. the fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been well you know you win the war in 12 minutes why do you need something better but I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying suborbital flights to space very soon wait a minute what's happening here it will have military Fighters what's up orbital capability and I think very soon this but the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first okay I look forward to a new. Kepler space race let's call it remember the space race in the 60s was for National Prestige because we lost the first two milestones we didn't lose them technically the fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it you can argue that's not a technical loss but it wasn't a technical lost but it was a Prestige loss America the world saw America as not being the leader technology and that's in that was a very strong thing and then we flew Alan Shepard weeks after Gagarin not months or decades or whatever so we had the capability but America lost. we lost and and because of that we made a big jump to recover it. well again that's interesting here is we've lost to the Russians on the first couple of Milestones already you cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America can't do it. you can buy it in Russia. you can fly with Russian Hardware this is available because a Russian space program is starving and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats it's commercial it's can be defined as space tourism there are also offering a trip to go on this trip around the moon like Apollo 8 was done hundred million bucks so I can go to the moon but you know would you have fought back in the sixties when the space race was going on that the first commercial hapless like thing to do. how to buy a ticket to go to the Moon would be a Russian hardware and would you have thought with the Russians but thought that when they first go to the moon and they're developed Hardware is a guys inside won't be Russians maybe we'll probably be a Japanese or American billionaire well that's weird you know it really is but anyway I think we need to beat him again I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful very successful Private spaceflight Industry or not really doesn't matter the Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concord and then they flew a few cargo flights and took it out of service you know that I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is is is offered commercial development for human spaceflight this little thing says or five times what NASA is doing. by 2020. already there's about a billion and a half 2 billion .7 investment in private spaceflight that is not that government already worldwide if you read Google it you'll find about half of that money but there's twice of that being being committed out there not spent yet been committed and plan for the next few years that's pretty big I'm predicting though as profitable as this industry is going to be in it certainly is profitable when you fly with people at $200,000 on something that you can that you can actually operate it at a tenth of that cost or less it's going to be very profitable I predict also that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the US taxpayer expense for NASA's manned spacecraft work and every dollar that flows into that will be spent. efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15. and what that means is before we know it. the progress. in human space flight with no taxpayer dollars will be at a level of about 5 times as much as the current NASA budget for human spaceflight and that is because. it's. it's Private Industry you should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff and we've done it for a long time the NACA before NASA never developed an airliner and never ran an airline. but NASA is developing the spaceliner always has and runs the only. space line. okay and we've tried away from it because we are afraid of it. but starting back in June of 2004 when I show that a little little group out there actually can do it can get a start with it everything changed after that okay thank you very much.traffic is a global epidemic us traffic is creating 45% of the world's pollution in the UK time wasted in traffic cost 20 billion a year would you place a clean around the Falls to commute Stockholm put it to a vote for it. how to do something install come to improve the environment and to get the better of a flow in the traffic will put a price on taking your car into the center Palo Alto Stealth Cam and we called that congestion charges. if you stop a system that system doesn't work on the first day then you will be in big trouble if not the perfect from Davon. there are teaching them tickets to the city each is equipped with cameras on the rear and front license plates these pictures are sent to Central system that identifies the license plates and make sure that the right person pays for the right passages of the license plate we went out IBM's Global organization and the R&D centres and find a very good software we could use a way to manage p.m. to mount it in two months time going to 9% of old pictures are correct identified. nice guys this is how it should be all the time you go see the traffic of the truck is 6 p.m. before we have the congestion charge in the traffic was chewing up at this time of day it is I think it's a good idea because I think that we should take care of the environments in the CD was about fourteen percent better that is huge International interest from different parts of the world from the United States from Latin America from China and its really pretty sure to tell people no pork we're planning to do what we're actually have done install come she is not thinking like me for. I'm thinking for the children and eight grandchildren.",0.734375,
80,CalebChung_2007P.sph.wav,little creatures that you can love now these are this now that's the mcnugget maker and this is a this is my oldest daughter making a mcapple pie and let 's see you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar and then you eat and you eat a feeling of caring and we have i have a little something here now i do want to say that you know ugobe is not there yet we've just opened the door and it's for all of you to step through it we did include some things that are hopefully useful me pleo they he has a usb and he has a sd card so it's completely open architecture so anyone can plug him thank you this is john over here anyone can take pleo and they can totally redo you can change his homeostatic drives or whatever you want to call them kids can just drag and drop put in new sounds we actually so it's he likes that so they're a handful we hope you get one missing to say but as a last thing i'd like to say is that if we continue along this path we are designing our about three hundred pounds now no she's not she's beautiful this is how they looked when they came out at the end these are a this is like a fifteen million dollar line and it through some a that paid the rent for about a month this is a walking barbie i said oh this is i'm using little phone connectors or was or kind of am a toy designer and before i was a toy designer oh i was a mime a street mime actually and then i made a lego animator i thought this would be so great and you know lego don't i started doing animatronics i loved dinosaurs i used to be in the film business kind of and actually nicholas negroponte saw this when i was like twelve and anyway so then they said no you have to make and so this is a i used to kind of be an actor and i'm not really very good at it but the this is a guy named doctor yutz who would take toys and show kids about engineering and you can see the massively parallel processing nintendos there and over to the left is a view master of the cd rom and a guy named stan reznikov did this as a pilot this is a you can see the little and then i was an entertainer i guess and before that i was a silversmith and before that i was i was out of the house at about fifteen and a half and i that was the first batch of products most of them did not go you get one out of twenty one out of thirty products and every now and then we do something like a you know an automated hair wrap machine you know that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out and and we'd make some money on that you know and we'd give it out but eventually we left la and we moved to idaho where there was actually a lot of peace and quiet and i started working on this project oh i have to tell you about this real quick you know you to find innovation and i tried to sum this up in some kind of symbol that means something to me anyway and so art and science have a kind of dynamic balance that's where i think innovation happens and actually this is to me how i can come up with great ideas but it's not how you actually get leverage actually you have to put a circle around that and call it business and those three together i think give you leverage in the world but moving on so this is a quick tale i'm going to tell this is the furby tale as he said i was co inventor of the furby i did the body and creature well you'll see so by way of showing you this you can kind of get an understanding of what it is to hopefully try to create robotic life forms or technology that has an emotional connection with the user so this is my family this is my wife christi and abby and melissa and my seventeen year old now emily who was just a pack of trouble all right there 's there's that robot again i came out of the movie business as i said and i said let 's make these animatronic robots let 's make these things and so i've always had a big interest in this this one actually didn't go anywhere but i got my feet wet doing this this is a smaller one and i have a little moving torso on there a little tiny guy walks along more servo drives lots of servo hacking lots of mechanical stuff so the challenge was i worked for microsoft for a little bit working on the microsoft barney and this is a you know the purple dinosaur with kind of bloat wear and you know fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form and that's our little thirty cent mabuchi motor and so i have all these design books like i'm sure many of you have and throughout the books this is the first page on furby i have kind of the art and science i have the really cool anyway i wanted over here and the how over there i try to do a lot of philosophy a lot of thinking about all of these projects because they're not just bing ideas you have to really dig deep to show you a little bit about the world of toy design at least from my small aperture of the world this is a this is a video i made when i first started that turned out to be a little more than true there's my first exploded view and all the little pieces and the little worm drive and all that stuff the little bb in the box is my tilt sensor i just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic so there's the back of his head with a billion holes in it and there i am i'm done there's my little furby no it's a little robot on heroin or something i think right now you see i love little robots so my wife says well you may like it but nobody else will so she comes to the rescue this is my wife christi who is just you know doing toy design i'm in my garage making weird stuff and then you go to these toy companies and there's some guy across the table and he goes pass pass pass you know you think it's so cool but they anyway i'd made this little tape that i always show when i go in this is the name of my so here 's a little pink one a little pouf on his head and here 's this didn't do so well in testing either i don't know why there's my favorite demon furby that was a good one and since then every time i come home from toys r us with dolls or something they disappear from my desk and they get hidden in the house i have three girls and they just they it's like a rescue animal thing they're going little tether coming off it's just a control for the fur 's mouth and his eyes it's just a little server control and i made a and that's how we sold him and hasbro actually said i meant tiger electronics at the time said yeah we want to do this we have you know ran the parts for that so this is how they come out close to the end and then they looked like little garfields there eight months later you may remember this this was a total total total chaos for a while they were making two million furbys a month they actually wound up doing about forty million furbys i it's unbelievable how i don't know how that can be and hasbro made about you know a billion and a half dollars so full circle why do i do this why do you you know try to do this stuff and it's of course for your kids and there's my youngest daughter with her furbys and she still actually has those so i kind of retired and we're already living in paradise up in boise on a river you know and then i started another company called toy innovation and we did some projects with mattel with a actually with a lady who 's here ivy ross and moves baby made it in wired magazine did a bunch of other stuff and then i started another company we did a little guy saw it and then people started to want to do it and they said they'd spend all this time so i said ok let 's try to do this dinosaur project the crazy idea is we're going to try to a dinosaur as much as we can with today 's technology and it's not really but as close as we can do and we're going to try to really so i used to work at mattel actually and after i left mattel i started pull this off intentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive not a robot that kind of does but let 's really go for it so i picked a camarasaurus because the camarasaurus was the most abundant of the sauropods in north america and you could actually find full fossil evidence of these that's a juvenile and so we actually went in there's a book very very obsessive there's a kind of truncated camarasaurus skeleton but the geometry 's correct and then i went in and measured all the geometry because i figured hey biomimicry if i do it kind of right it might move kind of like the real thing so there's the motor and about this time you know all these other people are starting to help here 's an example of what we did with the skull there's the skull all these hamburger makers and then got the license to make the maker so this is a hamburger maker that you take the peanut butter and stuff and you put it in there and it makes and this is a french fry maker little tiny there's some solid works versions of it here 's some sla parts of the same thing and then these are really crude pieces we were just doing some tests here there's the skull pretty much the same shape as the camarasaurus there's a photo realistic eye behind a lens and there's kind of the first exploded view or see through view there's the first sla version and it already kind of has the feel it has kind of a cuteness already and the thing about blending science and art in this multidisciplinary stuff is you can do a robot and then you go back and do the shape and then you go back and forth the servos in the front legs we had to shape those like muscles they had to fit within the a tremendous amount of work to get all that working right all the neck and the tail are cable so it moves smoothly and organically and then of course you're not done yet you have to get the look for the skin the skin 's a whole another thing probably the hardest part so you hire artists and you try to get the look and feel of the character now this is not with character designers right and we're still trying to keep with the real character so now you go back and you cover the whole thing with clay now you start doing the sculpture for this and you can see we got a guy from who 's just john sosoka is our cto and is really the man that's done most of the work with our like forty person company i'd like to give john a hand he never gets recognition this right it's very painful so these and you can probably see them this i on purpose they go through life stages so when you first get them they're babies and you more you have them kind of the older they get and they kind of learn through their behavior so this one this one 's actually asleep and so this guy 's listening to my voice here but they have forty sensors all over their body they have seven processors they have fourteen motors they have you don't care do you they're just cute right that's the idea that's the idea so you see hey come good wake up wake up wake up yeah they're like kids you know you yeah he 's hungry i'll show you what he 's been doing for for four years here here here have some money pleo that's what the investors think that right right so they're really sweet little guys and we're hoping that you know our belief is that humans need to feel empathy towards things in order to be more human and we think we can help that out by having,1,imma are was our kind of a toy designer and that before I was a toy designer oh I was a am I'm a street mime actually and then I was an Entertainer I guess and before that I was a silversmith in at 4 that I was I was out of the house in about 15 and a half and I never want to be going to college I didn't really I didn't see the point of the pit the time I do now after learning about all the quantum stuff. is this really cool anyway I wanted to I wanted to show you a little bit about the world toy design deleted from my small aperture the world this is a this is a video I made when I first started doing toy design I am in my garage making weird stuff and then you go to the toy companies and there's some guy across the table and it goes past past past you know you think it's so cool that they made this little tape that I'd always show when I go in this is the name of my company giving toys. so I used to work at Mattel actually a man after I left until I started doing you all these hamburger makers and then they got the license makers and so this is a hamburger maker that you can you take peanut butter and stop and put it in there and how to make a french fry maker little tiny food that this is a this is a McNugget maker and this is my oldest daughter making a apple pie sugar and then you eat when you eat can you eat this is like a 15 million dollar line and it got me through so much I only I didn't make any royalties on it but it got rid of a bunch of stuff that was a missile phone watches that didn't get sold this is a squishy head for no apparent. some effects that I did 4-way kryolan roll it was a robot fighting robot. pretty cool there at this is not we're doing some plate testing on my little plug thing if this can really grab it does pretty good. musical phone connectors to make them so they can Spinners and that's how they still have those album things by the kids don't know what they are talk to us about Play-Doh don't take Legos to Lego Sonic but I love dinosaurs and actually Nicholas when I was like 12 and this is me using solid free Studio back in the 80s. navigate to Taco Bell in the back or foam core cut out to the people.so this place is a used to trying to be an actor and I'm really not very good at it with you this is a guy named dr. yachts in the massively parallel processing Nintendo's there an over the left. hey hey hey quick and easy take it easy this is all the batteries are gone kind of first batch of products most of them did not go you'll get one out of 21 out of 30 products and every now and then we do something like that you know an automated machine and we'd make some money on that you know when we get on it but eventually we left LA and we move to Idaho and there's actually a lot of peace and quiet and and I started working on this project I have to tell you about this real quick throughout this whole thing making toys I'm I think there is a a real correlation with innovation in Art and Science there's some kind of a blend that happens that allow. you know what you Define innovation and I try to sum this up in some kind of symbol that that means something to me anyway and so Art and Science health and kind of a dynamic balance that's where I think Innovation happens and actually this is to me how I can come up with great ideas but it's not how you actually get leverage actually you have to put a circle around that and call that business and those three together I think give you leverage in the world but moving on so this is a quick tail I'm going to tell like this is the Furby Tail as he said I was going to the Furby I did the body and the creature will see by way of showing you that you can kind of get an understanding of what it is to hopefully try to create. robotic lifeforms or technology that that has an emotional connection with the user so this is my family this is my wife Christie a Navien and I'm Alyssa and my seven-year-old now Emily who who was just a pack of trouble all right there's a there's that robot again I came out the movie business as I said and I said let's make these subtle animatronic robots let's let's make these things and so I fall I had a big interest in this this one actually didn't go anywhere but I got my feet wet doing this then this is a smaller one and I have a little moving torso in their little tiny guy walks along more Servo Drive lots of servile hacking lots of mechanical stuff there's another one actually has Skeletor legs I think he's wearing their little pony little pony was I work for Microsoft for a little bit working on the Microsoft Barney and this is the purple dinosaur with with kind of bloatware and you know they had lots of lots of stuff in there that you didn't. I thought and then Microsoft can just fill up you know where house full of this stuff and see if they sell sole it's really strange business model compared to from coming from a toy company but anyway a friend of mine and I decided to see if we could do like a single cell organism what's the what's the fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form that's a little $0.30 mabuchi motor and so I have all these I design looks like I'm sure many of you have a and throughout the boxes the first page on Furby I have kind of Art and Science I have the fly over here on the highway over there I try to do a lot of laughs with a lot of thinking about all these projects cuz they're not just being ideas you have to really dig deep in these things so there's some real pseudocode over here and getting the idea of different kind of drives things like that and he only had two eyes and some batteries on the bottom and then we should why you going to feed him and then you need to talk and it got more complicated then I had to figure out how many's that one motor to make the eyes move and the ears move and the body to move in the mouth to move and you want to make it blank and do all that at the same time so I came up with this kind of. expression thing with these cams and feedback that work pretty well then I start to get a little more realistic and I have to start driving this stuff and and there's my note to self at the top lots of engineering stuff that turned out to be a little more than true there's my first exploded view and all the little pieces in a little worm drive and all that stuff and then I got to start building it so it's just a real thing I get out start cutting my finger and and glue and things together and that's my little workshop and there's the first little Cam that drove Furby and there is a Furby On the Half-Shell you see little little baby in the box is my tilt sensor I I just basically not all this stuff out of out of plastic so there's the back of his head to the Billy and holes in it and there I am I'm done there's my little Furby know it's a it's a little robot on on heroin or something I think so. right now is the AMA I love little robots in my wife has up will you may like it that but nobody else will so she comes to the rescue as my wife Christie who's just you know from I'm using my partner for eternity here and she does drawings right she's she's actually you know artists and she starts doing all these different drawings and does a little color patterns and the coloring books and I like the guy with the cigar at the bottom there I thought. Contessa well that I like and then she started doing these other images at that time beanie babies with a big hit with that won't do a bunch of different ones so here's a little pink one little poop on his head and here's this didn't do so well in testing either on a wide there's my favorite demon for a beef that was a that was a good one anyway finally settle on kind of this kind of little poopy body little imaginary character and there is little bush baby on the headlights there I actually went to Toys R Us a little furry cat ripped it apart and made this and since then every time I come home from Toys R Us with with dolls or something they they disappear for my desk and they get hit in the house I'm like my have three girls may just be that fits like a rescue animal things are going there. it's a little tender coming off as just a control for that for the first mouth and his eyes it's just a little Servo control and I made a video. you can check on my phone and that's how we sold them actually said the sign said that yeah we want to do this we have you know 13 weeks or something the toy fair and and and we're going to hire you guys to do this and so they've been I got working mostly me cuz it was all mechanics at this point so now I have to really figure out all kinds of stuff I don't know how to do and I started working with SolidWorks in a whole other group to do that and we started this is way back to work before it was really much SLA going on not a lot of rapid prototyping we certainly don't have the money to do this they only take me like a little bit of money do this so I had to call a friend of a friend who who was running the GM prototype plant as a late flight that was down and cut it a Hewlett-Packard We snuck in on the weekend and so we just had a disc of of the files but they have a closed system so you couldn't print the things out on the machine so we actually printed them out on clear and take them on the monitors.. Can we we ran the parts for that so this is how they came up close to the end and then they look like little Garfield's they're eight months later you may remember this this was a total total total chaos for a while they're making 2 million per views a month they actually wind up doing about 40 million Furbies it's unbelievable how I don't know how that can be and I Hasbro made about you know billing and a half dollars and I mean.so full circle why do I do this what why do you going to try to do this stuff in its course for your kids and there's my youngest daughter with with her Furby since she still actually has those already living in Paradise boys out of river going also and then I started another company called twinnovation and we did that some projects with a Mattel action with the lady who survived your Ross and the Miracles moves baby made it Wired Magazine bunch of other stuff and then start another company with a little a handheld device for for teens that could hook up the internet one best imitations at CES but but really I kind of slow down I said okay I just after while I had this old tape of this dinosaur and I gave this guy and this other guy saw it and and then then people started want to do it and they said they'd spent all this time so I said okay let's let's try to do this Dinosaur Project the crazy idea is we're going to try to clone a dinosaur it as much as we can with today's technology and it's not really but as close as we can do an end and we're going to try to really. pull this off intensely try to make something that seems like it's alive not a robot that kind of does but let's really go for it so I picked a camarasaurus because the camarasaurus was the most abundance of the of the sauropods in North American you can actually find full fossil evidence of these that's a juvenile and until we actually went and there's a book called walking on eggshells where they found actual a sauropod skin Patagonia the picture for the book so when I I told this couple to use use this bump pattern whatever you can to copy that very very upset if there's a kind of truncated camarasaurus skeleton but the geometry is correct and then I went and got all the geometry cuz I figured he might move kind of like the real thing so there's the motor and sold it about this time you know all these other people are starting to help a s a twitch of the skull there's this there's my drawing of a skull there's kind of a skinned version of the soft tissue there's the mechanism that would go in their kind of a Geneva Drive there's some SolidWorks versions of a fearsome SLA parts of the same thing and. he's a really cruel thesis we're just doing some tests here there's the skull pretty much the same shape as as the camarasaurus there is a photo-realistic I'm behind a lens and there is kind of the first exploded view or see through view there's the first SLA version is already kind of has the field has kind of a cuteness already and the thing about blending science and art and its multidisciplinary stuff that you can do a robot then go back and do the the shape and then you go back and forth the servos in the front legs we had to shake those like mussels I had to fit within the envelope there was a tremendous amount of work to get all that work and write all the neck of the tailor cable so it moves smoothly and organically and then of course you're not done yet you have to get the look for the skin to skin a whole nother thing probably the hardest part so you hire artisan and you try to get the look and feel of the character notice Network character designer is right and and we're still trying to keep with with the with a real character so now you go back and you cover the whole thing with Clay now you start doing other sculpture for this and you can see that we got a guy from whose just to a fanatic about dinosaurs do the skeleton for us. spoon shaped teeth and everything and then more sculpting in more sculpting any more scope to get them are sculpting and then later we have to talk is RCT on this really the man that's done most of the work with are like 41st and Company I like to give John a handy never gets recognition does John Soca. so I thank you John thank you and it back to work alright man alright. it is very painful so so when you first get them there at the babies and then the more you have them kind of the older they get in the kind of learn to their behavior so this one this one's actually asleep and. play up wake up. play upcoming so this guy's listen to my voice here but they have 40 sensors all over their body they have a 7 processors they have 14 Motors they have you don't care do you say just cute right that's the idea that's the idea where do you feel that there's something big and loud over here. wake up wake up wake up there yeah they're like kids you know you yeah yeah I'll show you what he's been doing for 44 years here here here have some money please. that's what that's what the investors think says it's just. right right so they're really sweet little guys and we're hoping that you know our belief is it that humans need to feel empathy towards towards things in order to be more human than we think we can help it out by having. all creatures that you can love Nada Surf robots are kind of love Bots you know they they do change over time but mostly they evoke a feeling of caring and we have I have a little something here now I do want to say that. you know you go be as is not there yet we're just open the door and and it's for all of you to step through it we we did include some things that are hopefully useful excuse me please all day he has a USB and he has a SD card completely open architecture so anyone can plug him thank you this is John or hear anyone can take Cleo and they can totally redo his personality you can make him bipolar or someone said. yes you can you can change his his a homeostatic drives are you whatever you want to call them kids can just drag and drop put a new sounds we actually yeah it's very hard to keep people from doing this we have one animator whose who's taking it and instead of take on the Budweiser beer commercial they're going. does he like that. so that there are a handful we hope you get one I don't know what I'm missing to say but as a last thing I'd like to say is that if we continue along this path we are designing our children's best friends there's a lot of social responsibility in that that's why it's Leo soft and gentle and loving and so. I just I hope you all Dream well thank you,0.7395833730697632,
81,CameronHerold_2009X.sph.wav,and jim clark and jim barksdale have all got it and they built netscape imagine if they were given ritalin we wouldn't have have that stuff right al gore would have really invented the internet a video that was done by one of the companies that i mentor these guys grasshopper it's about kids it's about entrepreneurship hopefully this inspires you to take what you've heard from me and do something with it to change the world be an entrepreneur entrepreneurs are people because we have a lot of them in this room who have these ideas and these passions or see these needs in the world and decide to stand up and do it we have an obligation as parents and a society to start teaching our kids to fish instead of giving them the fish the old parable if you give a man a fish you feed him for a day if you teach a man to fish you feed him for a lifetime if we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial the ones that show those traits to be like we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science what if we saw the ones who had entrepreneurial traits and taught them to be entrepreneurs we could have all these kids spreading businesses instead of waiting for government handouts that i'm the dumbest guy in the room because i couldn't get through school i struggled with school but what i knew at a very early age was that i loved money and i loved business and i loved this entrepreneurial thing and i was raised to be an entrepreneur what we do is we sit and teach our kids all the things they shouldn 't do don't hit don't bite don't swear right now we teach our kids to go after really good jobs you know and the school system teaches them to go after things like being a doctor and being a lawyer and being an accountant and a dentist and a teacher and a pilot and the media says that it's really cool if we could go out and be a model or a singer or a sports hero like sidney crosby our mba programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs even in popular literature the only book i've ever found and this should be on all of your reading lists the only book i've ever found that makes the entrepreneur into the hero is atlas shrugged and we all decided to start these things because it's really the only place we fit we didn't fit in the normal work we couldn't work for somebody else because we're too stubborn and we have all these other traits kids could be entrepreneurs as well i'm a big part of a couple organizations globally called the entrepreneurs organization and the young presidents organization i just came back from speaking in barcelona at the ypo global conference and everyone that i met over there who 's an entrepreneur go on and on kids you can see these signs in kids and what we're doing is we're giving them ritalin and saying don 't be an entrepreneurial type fit into this other system and try to become a student and what i've been really passionate about ever since and i've never spoken about this ever until now so this is the first time anyone 's ever heard it except my wife three days ago because she said what are you talking about and i told aren't students we fast track we figure out the game i stole essays i cheated on exams i hired kids to do my accounting assignments in university for thirteen consecutive assignments but as an entrepreneur you don't do accounting you hire accountants so i just figured that out earlier at least i can admit i cheated in university most of you won 't i'm also quoted and i told the person who wrote the textbook i'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook in every canadian heard those things about is it nurture or is it nature right is it thing one or thing two what is it well i don't think it's either i think it can be both i was groomed as an entrepreneur when i was growing up as a young kid i had no choice because i was taught at a very early young age when my dad realized i wasn't going to fit in to everything else that was being taught to me in school that he could teach me to figure out business at an early age he groomed us the three of us to hate the thought of having a job and to love the fact of creating companies that we could employ other people my first little business venture i was seven years old i was in winnipeg and i was lying in my bedroom with one of those long extension cords and i was calling all the dry cleaners in winnipeg to find out how much would the dry cleaners pay me for coat hangers and my mom came into the room and she said where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners is that i think we miss an opportunity to find these kids who have the entrepreneurial traits and to groom them i was going door to door in the neighborhood to collect coat hangers to put in the basement to sell because i saw her a few weeks before that you could get paid they used to pay you two cents per coat hanger so i was just like well there's all kinds of coat hangers and so i'll just go get them and i knew she wouldn't want me to go get them so i just did and i learned that you could actually negotiate with people this one person offered me three cents and i got him up to three and a half i even knew at a seven year old age that i could actually get a fractional percent of a cent and people would pay that because it multiplied up at seven years old i figured it out i got three and a half cents for a thousand coat hangers i sold license plate protectors door to door my dad actually made me go find someone who would sell me these things at wholesale and at nine years old i walked around the city of sudbury but you have two cars and they don't have license plate protectors and he said i know and i said the car here 's got one license plate that's all crumpled up and he said yes that's my wife 's car and i said why don't we just test one on the front of your wife 's car and see if it lasts longer so i knew there were two cars with two license plates on each if i couldn't sell all four i could at least get one i learned that at a young age show them that being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing it's not something that is a bad thing and is vilified which is what happens in a lot of society i did comic book arbitrage when i was about ten years old i sold comic books out of our cottage on georgian bay and i would go biking up to the end of the beach and buy all the comics from the poor kids and then i would go back to the other end of the beach and sell them to the rich kids so that's obvious right it's like a recession so there's a recession there's still thirteen trillion dollars circulating in the u s economy go get some of so not only would he get me one but i had to get two and then he wanted me to hire someone to deliver half the papers which i did and then i realized that collecting tips was where you made all the money so i would collect the tips and get payment so i would go and collect for all the papers he could just deliver them because then i realized i could make the money by this point i was definitely not going to be an employee my dad owned an automotive and industrial repair shop and he had all these old automotive parts lying around and they had this old brass and copper kids when we grow up have dreams and we have passions and we have visions and somehow we get those things crushed i got paid and i thought that was kind of cool strangely enough thirty years later we're building one eight hundred got junk and making money make these chairs and i had these little pillows that i would sew up and you could stuff pins in them because people used to sew and they needed a pin cushion but what i realized was that you had to have options so i actually spray painted a whole bunch of them brown and then when i went to the door it wasn 't do you want to buy one it was which color would you like right like cutting lawns is brutal but because i had to cut lawns all summer for all of our neighbors and get paid to do that i realized that recurring revenue from one client is amazing that if i land this client once and every week i get paid by that person that's way better than trying to sell one i would caddy i would go to the golf course and caddy for people but i realized that there was this one hill on our golf course the thirteenth hole that had this huge hill and people could never get their bags up so i would sit there with a lawn chair and just carry up all the people who didn't have caddies i would carry their golf bags up to the top and they'd pay me a dollar meanwhile my friends were working for five hours some guy 's bag around and get paid ten bucks i'm like that 's stupid because you have to work for five hours that doesn't make any sense you just figure out a way to make more money faster every week i would go to the corner store and buy all these pops then i would go up and deliver them to these seventy year old women playing bridge and they'd give me their orders for the following week and then i'd just deliver pop and i'd just charge twice and i had this captured market you didn't need contracts i went and got golf balls from golf courses but everybody else was looking in the bush and looking in the ditches for golf balls i'm like screw that they're all in the pond and nobody 's going into the pond so i would go into the ponds and crawl around and pick them up with my toes you just pick them up with both feet you can't do it on stage and i packaged them up three ways i had the pinnacles and ddhs and the really cool ones back then those sold for two dollars each and then i had all the good ones that didn't look crappy two years ago i was the highest rated lecturer at mit 's entrepreneurial master 's program and it was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs from around the world to all the kids in high school this is what really kind of gets everybody hating you is because you're trying to extract money from all your friends all the time but it paid the bills so i sold lots and lots of sunglasses and then when the school shut me down the school actually called me into the office and told me i couldn't do it so i went to the gas stations and i sold lots of them to the gas stations and had the gas stations sell them to their customers that was cool because then i had retail outlets and i think i was fourteen and then i paid my entire way through first year university by selling wine skins door to door you know that you can hold a forty oz bottle of rum and two bottles of coke in a wineskin so what right yeah but you know what you stuff that down your shorts when you go into a football game you can get booze in for free everybody bought them you know we teach our kids and we buy them games but why don't we get them games if they're entrepreneurial kids that kind of nurture the traits that you need to be entrepreneurs why don't you teach them not to waste money i remember being told to walk out in the middle of a street in banff alberta because i'd thrown a penny out on the street and my dad said go pick it up he said i work too damn hard for my money i'm not going to see you ever waste a penny and i remember that lesson to this day when i was in grade two i won a city wide speaking competition but nobody had ever said hey this kid 's a good speaker he can't focus but he loves walking around and getting people energized no one said get him a coach in speaking they said get me a tutor in what i breeding kids at a young age to expect a regular paycheck that's wrong for me if you want to raise entrepreneurs what i do with my kids now i've got two nine and seven is i teach them to walk around the house and the yard looking for that needs to get done come to me and tell me what it is or i'll come to them and say here 's what i need done and then you know what we do we negotiate they go around looking for what it is but then we negotiate on what they're going to get paid the fifty percent that goes in their house account every six months goes to the bank they walk up with me every year all the money in the bank goes to their broker both my nine and seven year old have a stock broker already but i'm teaching them to force that savings habit it drives me crazy that thirty year olds are saying maybe i'll start contributing to my rsp now shit you've missed twenty five years a red shirt a blue tie a kangaroo and a laptop and have them tell a story about those four things my kids do that all the time it teaches them to sell it teaches them creativity it teaches them to think on their feet just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it get kids to stand up in front of groups and talk even if it's just stand up in front of their friends and do plays and have speeches those are entrepreneurial traits that you want to be nurturing show the kids what bad customers or bad employees look like show them the grumpy employees when you see grumpy customer service point that out to them say by the way that guys a crappy employee and say these ones are good ones if you go into a restaurant and you have bad customer service show them what bad customer service looks like we've all these lessons in front of us but we don't take those opportunities we teach kids to go get a tutor pull up the photos teach them how to do that kind of stuff and make money then the money they get fifty percent goes in their house account fifty percent goes in their toy account my kids love this stuff two traits that i want you to also look out for that we don't kind of get out of their system don't medicate kids for attention deficit disorder unless it is really really freaking bad the same with the whole things on mania and stress and depression unless it is so clinically brutal man bipolar disorder is nicknamed the ceo disease when steve jurvetson,1,I would be willing to bet that I'm the dumbest guy in the room because I couldn't get through school I started to school but what I knew at a very early age was that I love money and I love business and I love entrepreneurial thing and I was raised to be an entrepreneur and what I've been really passionate about ever since and I've never spoken about this ever until now so this is the first time I've never heard of it. My wife 3 days ago cuz she said what are you talking about and I told her is that I think we miss an opportunity to find these kids who have the entrepreneurial traits and to groom them or show them that being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing it's not something that is a bad thing and is vilified which is what happens in a lot of society kids when we grow up have dreams and we have passions and we have visions and somehow we get those things crushed and we got told that we need to study harder or be more focused or get a tutor and my parents got me a tutor in French and I still suck in French. two years ago I was the highest-rated lecture at MIT master's program and it was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs from around the world when I was in grade two I want a Citywide speaking competition but nobody had ever said hey this kid's a good speaker he can't focus but he loves walking around and getting people energize know when he said give him a coach and speaking they say give me a tutor and what I suck at those kids show these traits we need to start looking for them I think we should be raising kids to be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers and unfortunately the school system is grooming this world to say hey let's be a lawyer or a doctor and we're missing an opportunity cuz no one ever says Hey be an entrepreneur entrepreneur is our people cuz we're a lot of in this room who have these ideas in these passions or CDs needs in the world we decide to stand up and do it and we put everything on the line to make that stuff happen. we have the ability to get those groups of people around us and want to kind of build that dream with us and I think if we could get kids to to to embrace the idea of the young age of being entrepreneurial we could change everything in the world that's a problem to every problem is that there's somebody has the idea for in as a young kid nobody can say it can't happen because you're too dumb to realize that you couldn't figure it out I think we have an obligation is parents in a society to start teaching our kids to fish instead of giving them the fish they're all terrible if you give a man a fish you feed him for a day if you teach a man to fish you feed a lifetime if we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial the one that showed those traits to be like we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science what it was we saw the ones that aren't you afraid to talk to me on Pandora's we could actually have all these kids braiding business is instead of waiting for government handouts. what we do is we sitting with teach our kids all the things they shouldn't do don't hit don't bite don't swear right now we teach our kids to go after really good jobs you know the school system teaches them to go after things like being a doctor and being a lawyer and be an accountant to the dentist in the teacher in a pilot and the media says that it's really cool if we could go out and be a model or a singer Sports hero like Longo Crosby are MBA programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs the reason that I avoided them to a program other than the fact that I couldn't get into any cuz I had a 61% average out of high school and then 61% average of the only School in Canada that accept me Carlton are MBA programs don't teach kids to be entrepreneurs they teach him to go work in corporation so who's starting these companies that these random few people. even in popular literature the only book I've ever found and it should be on all of your reading list the only book I've ever found that makes the entrepreneur into the hero is Atlas Shrugged everything else in the world tends to look at entrepreneurs and say that we're bad people I look at even my family my both my grandfathers were entrepreneur is my dad does not remember both my brother and sister and I all three of us owned companies as well and then we all decide to start these things cuz it's really the only place we sit we didn't fit in the normal work we couldn't work for somebody else cuz we're too stubborn and we have all these other traits that kids could be entrepreneurs as well I'm a big part of a couple organizations globally call the entrepreneurs organization of Young Presidents organization I just came back from speaking in Barcelona at the Y P o n Global conference and everyone that I met over there who is an entrepreneur. struggled with school I have 18 of the 19 signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed so this thing right here is freaking me out. it's probably why I'm a little bit panicked right now is other than all the caffeine that I've had in the sugar but like this is like really creepy for an entrepreneur attention deficit disorder bipolar disorder bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease Ted Turner's got it Steve Jobs has it all three of the founders of Netscape how to act like a go on and on the kids you can see the signs and kids and what we're doing is we're giving them Ritalin and saying don't be an entrepreneurial type fit into this other system and try to become a student sorry on speakers aren't student we Fast Track we figure out the game I stole assays I cheated on exams I hired kids to do my accounting assignments in University for 13 consecutive assignments but like as an entrepreneur you don't do accounting you hire accountant so I just figured that out earlier. at least I can admit I cheated and University most of you won't I'm also quoted weird and I told the person who wrote The Textbook on now quoted in that exact same University textbook and every Canadian University and college studies in managerial accounting chapter 8 I open up chapter 8 talking about budgeting and I told the author after they did my interview that I cheated in that same course and she thought it was too funny to not include it anyway but kids you can see the signs in the the definition of an entrepreneur is a person who organizes operates and assumes the risk of a business venture that doesn't mean you have to go to an MBA program it doesn't mean you have to get through school just means that those few things have to feel right in your gut and we've heard those things what is it nurture or is it nature right is that Thing 1 and Thing 2 what is it well I don't think it's either I think it can be both I was groomed as an entrepreneur when I was growing up as a young kid I had no choice cuz I was taught at a very early young age will my dad realize I wasn't going to fit into everything else it was being talked to me in school that he could teach me to figure out business at an early age he groomed us the three. to hate the thought of having a job and to love the fact of creating companies that we can employ other people my first little business venture I was 7 years old I was in Winnipeg and I was lying in my bedroom with one of those long extension cord and I was calling all of the dry cleaners Winnipeg find out how much would the dry cleaners pay me for coat hangers and my mom came into the room and she said where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners and I said let's go and look in the basement and we went down to the basement and I opened up this cupboard there's about a thousand coat hangers that I'd collected because when I told her I was going to play with the kids I was going door-to-door in the neighborhood to cut coat hangers to put in the basement to sell cuz I saw her a few weeks ago a few weeks before that taking you could get paid they used to pay you $0.02 for coat hanger so I was just like well there's all kinds of coat hangers and so I'll just go get them I knew she wouldn't want me to go get them so I just did it anyway. but and I learned that you could actually negotiate with people this one person offered me $0.03 and I got him up to three and a half I even knew what a seven year old age that I can actually get a fractional percent of a scent and people would pay that cuz it multiplied up at seven years old I figured I got three and a half cents for a thousand coat hangers I sold license plate protectors door-to-door my dad actually made me go find someone who would sell me these things at wholesale and it nine years old I walked around in the City of Sudbury selling license plate protectors door to door two houses and I remember this one customer so vividly because I can never I also did some other stuff with these clients are sold newspapers and and he wouldn't buy a newspaper from me ever but I was convinced was going to buy a license plate protector and he's like well we don't need one I said but you got two cars and I'm 9 years old like you but you have two cars and they don't have license plate protectors and I said I know and I said to end this car here has got one license plate this all crumpled up and he said yes that's my wife's car and I said why don't we just test one on the front of your wife's car and see if it lasts longer so I knew there were two cars with two license plates on each if I couldn't sell all four I can least get one. I learned out of the young age I did comic book Arbitrage when I was about ten years old I sold comic books are at her Cottage on Georgian Bay and I would go biking up to the end of the beach when by all the comics from the poor kids and then I'll go back to the other end of the beach and sell them to the rich kids but it was obvious to me right Buy Low sell High you got this demand over here that has money don't try to sell to the poor kids are going to pass the rich people do go get some so that's obvious right that's like a recession so there's a reception there still 13 trillion-dollar circulating in the US economy go get some of that and I learned that at a young age I also learned don't Reveal Your Source cuz I got beat up after about four weeks of doing this cuz one of the kids found it when I was buying my Comics drum and he didn't like the fact he's paying a lot more I was forced to get a paper route at 10 years old I don't really want a paper route but at 10 my dad said that's going to be next business so not only would he get me one and I had to get two and then he wanted me to hire someone to deliver half the papers which I did and then I realized the collecting tips was where you made all the money so I would collect the tips and get payment so I would go and collect for all the papers he can just deliver them. cuz then I realized I can make the money I'd buy this point I was definitely not going to be in employee my dad owned in automotive and Industrial repair shop and he had all these old Automotive Parts lying around and they have the old brass and copper and so I asked him what he did with it and he said he just throws that I would miss it but wouldn't somebody pay you for that and he goes maybe ten years old to 34 years ago I saw an opportunity in this stuff I saw there was money in garbage and I was actually collecting it from all the automotive shops in the area of my bicycle in my dad would drive me on Saturdays to a scrap metal recycler where I got paid and I thought that was kind of cool strangely enough like 30 years later we're building 1-800 got junk in making money off that too I built these little pin cushions I was 11 years old and cubs we made these pin cushions for moms for Mother's Day and you made these pin cushions out of wooden clothespins who used to hang clothes on clothes lines inside and you make these chairs and I have these little pillows that I would show up and you could stuff pins in them and could people used to sell when they needed a pin cushion. so but when I realized was that you had that option so I actually spray-painted a whole bunch of them Brown and then when I went to the door it wasn't do you want to buy one it was like what color would you like like I'm 10 years old you not going to say no to me that is supposed to give two options of the brown one of the clear one so I learned that lesson of the young age I learned that manual labor really sucks. right like cutting Lawns is brutal but because I had to cut lawns all summer for all of our neighbors and get paid to do that I realized that recurring revenue from one client is amazing but I'm kind of Highlanders client ones and every week I get paid by that person that's way better than trying to sell one clothes pin thing to one person cuz you can't sell them or so I love that recurring Revenue model I start to learn to the young age and I was being groomed to do that I was not allowed to have jobs I would caddy I go to the golf course and and Carly for people but I realized it was at 1 Hill on our Golf Course the 13th hole that is huge hill and people can never get their bags are but why would sit there with a lawn chair and just carry up all the people who didn't have cavities I would carry their golf bags up to the top and they pay me a dollar mean while my friends were working 45 hours to haul some guys bag around to get paid 10 bucks I'm like that's stupid cuz you have to work 45 hours that doesn't make any sense you just figure out a way to make more money faster every week I would go to the corner store and buy all these pops and I'll go up and deliver them to the seven year old women. Bridge they give me their orders for the following week and then I just delivered pop and I just charged twice and I had the captured Market you didn't need contracts you just needed to have a supply and demand in this this audience who bought into you these women were going to go to anybody else cuz they like me and I kind of figured it out I went and got golf balls from golf courses but everybody else was like what you looking in the bush and looking in the ditches for golf balls I might screw that they're all in the pond and nobody's going into the pond so I would go into the ponds and crawl around and pick them up with my toes used to pick up with both feet and you can't do that on stage and them and you get the golf balls and you just throw them in your bathing suit when you're done you got a couple hundred of them but the problem is that people didn't all want all the golf balls so I just package them I'm like 12 right I pocketed them up three ways I had the Pinnacles & D D H is and they're really cool ones back then those sold for $2 each and then I have all the good ones that didn't look crappy they were $0.50 each and then I'd sell 50 at a time of all the crappy ones and they could use those for practice balls. a nice old sunglasses when I was in school so all the kids in high school this is what really kind of gets everybody hating you is cuz you're trying to extract money from all your friends all the time but it paid the bills so I sold lots and lots of sunglasses and then when the school shot me down the school actually called into the office and told me I couldn't do it so I went to the gas stations and I sold lots of them to the gas stations and had the gas station sell them to their customers that was cool cuz I had retail outlets and I was I think I was fourteen that I paid my entire way through first-year University Carlton by selling wineskins door-to-door you know that you can hold a 40 oz bottle of rum and two bottles of Coke and a wineskin so what right yeah but you know what you stuff that down your shorts when you go to a football game to get booze in for free everybody bought them. supply-demand big opportunity I also branded it so I sold them for five times in normal cost at our University logo on it you know we teach our kids and we can we buy them games but why don't we get them games if they're on her kids that kind of nurture the traits that you need to be on coronavirus why don't you teach them not to waste money I remember being told to walk out in the middle of the street and in Banff Alberta cuz I just want a penny out of the street my dad said go pick it up cuz I work too damn hard for my money I'm not going to see you ever waste a penny and I remember that lesson to this day allowances teach kids the wrong habits allowances by Nature teaching kids to think about a job an entrepreneur doesn't expect a regular paycheck allowances breeding kids at a young age to expect a regular paycheck. That's wrong for me if you want a raise on spinners what I do with my kids now I got to 9 and 7 as I teach them to walk around the house in the yard looking for stuff that needs to get done come to me and tell me what it is or I'll come to them and say here's what I need done and then you know we do we negotiate they go around looking for what it is but then we negotiate on what they're going. I paid and then they don't have a regular check but they have more opportunities to find more stuff and they were in the skillet negotiating and they learn the skill of finding opportunities as well you breed that kind of stuff each of my kids is to piggy banks 50% of all the money that they earn her to gifted 50% goes in their house account 50% goes in the toilet count anything out they can spend whatever they want the 50% because of their house account every 6 months goes to the bank they walk up with me every year of all the money in the bank close to their broker both by 9 & 7 year olds have a stockbroker already but I'm teaching them to force that savings have it it drives me crazy that thirty-year-old just saying maybe I'll start contributing tomorrow arispe now that you've missed 25 years like you can teach those habits two young kids when they don't even feel the pain yet don't read them bedtime stories every night maybe four nights out of the week read them bedtime stories and three nights of the week have them tell stories why don't you sit down with kids and give them four items a red shirt a blue tie a kangaroo in a laptop and have them tell a story about those were things my kids do that all the time at each of them to sell it to some creativity. think on their feet just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it take kids to stand up in front of groups and talk even if it's just end up in front of the friends and do plays and have speeches of their entrepreneurial traits that you want to be nurturing show the kids what bad customers are bad employees look like she was in the grumpy employees when you see Grumpy customer service point that out to them sleep by the way. Guys a crappy employee and save these ones are good ones. if you go to a restaurant you have bad customer service show them what bad customer service looks like we've all these lessons in front of us if we don't take those opportunities we teach kids to go get a tutor imagine if you actually took all the kids junk that's in the house right now all the toys that they're all grown two years ago and said why do we start selling some of this on Craigslist in Kijiji and they can actually sell it and learn how to find scammers when they get email offers come in they can come into your account or sub account or whatever but teach them how to fix the price guess the price pull up the logos layer they of the photos teach them how to do that kind of stuff and make money than the money they get 50% Gryffindor House account to 2% goes in the toilet count my kids love this stuff some of the entrepreneurial Tracy go to nurturing kids containment tenacity leadership introspection interdependence values all these traits you can find in young kids and you can help nurture them look for that kind of stuff is to trace that I want you to also look out for that we don't kind of get out of their system don't medicate kids for attention deficit disorder unless it is really really freaking bad. the same with the whole thing's of mania and stress and depression like unless it is so clinically brutal man bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease when Steve jurvetson Jim Clark and Jim Barksdale have all got it and they built Netscape imagine if they were given Ritalin we wouldn't have that stuff right Al Gore would have really had to have invented the internet. the skills are the skills that we should be teaching in the classroom as well as everything else I'm not saying don't get kids to want to be lawyers but how about getting entrepreneurship to be ranked right up there with the rest of them as well cuz there's huge opportunities in that I want to close with a quick little video the video that was done by one of the companies I meant to her these guys grasshopper it's about kids it's about entrepreneurship hopefully this inspires you to take what you've heard from me and do something with its change the world.thank you very much for having me. the electric grid was conceived in the age of Edison designed in age of Eisenhower installed in the age of Nixon and it has not been upgraded since it's just not able to keep up with modern need. for the notion of the smart grid is using what we have better making do with what we've got and not build so much new infrastructure software at the Gateway between generation and transmission can solve that problem who is Margaret is actually a bunch of smart devices connected over a network to a bunch of computers and computers brunch all this data and then are able to optimize the system what we're working on is helping utilities see what's actually happening in real time and terms the flow of electricity between all those devices benefits to Consumers benefits the environment all because of things we can now see so we couldn't see before on the Olympic Peninsula Pete and elda's goal was to make the smart grid tangible we were taking home area networks as a way of sending messages to the homes and to the devices in the home is about when they should run or not run. there was one other modem hear that absurd wirelessly the reports from the different elements we saved approximately during this time 15% of our electric bill if we can do that for everybody in the country were talking about saving a hundred billion dollars worth of infrastructure that we won't need to build IBM admit at first big company to really see the opportunity to marry Information Technology with the grid there are several things going on in South America Asia in Europe we've been working with Malta to make both of water and electricity systems much more efficient it is a model for how we can then bring that to other larger Geographic areas the path forward was Margaret is actually quite clear if we upgraded our telecommunications networks are satellite networks and we can do the exact same thing with the smart grid I went plant will go up and down by the minute a solar plant will go up and down as clouds go over so having a grid that can Flex itself in May. these these kinds of things is critical we need to be planning for the kind of future that we say we want which is an era of cheap reliable clean electricity for decades to come,0.7317708134651184,
82,CameronSinclair_2006.sph.wav,china the average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is thirty two that's how old i am so it's a young that led to a number of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub saharan africa responding to the hiv aids pandemic the best designed toilet in the world if you're ever ever in india go use this toilet chris luebkeman will tell you why i'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the party but but the future is not going to be the sky scraping cities of new york but this and when you look at this you see crisis what i see is many many inventors one billion people live in abject poverty we hear about them all the time four billion live in growing but fragile economies one in seven live in unplanned settlements if we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen in twenty years one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp look left look right one of you will be there how do we improve the living standards of five billion people with ten million solutions so i wish to develop a community that actively embraces innovative and sustainable design to improve the living conditions that's my wish we open source architecture is the way to go you have a diverse community of participants and we're not just talking about inventors and designers but we're talking about the funding model my role is not as a designer it's a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world and what we need is something that replicates me globally because i haven't slept in seven years in the west taking their idea and basically profiting from it so creative commons has developed the developing nations license and what that means that a designer can the siyathemba project i showed was the first ever building to have a creative commons license on it why not allow designers the opportunity to do this but still protecting their rights here we want to have a community where you can upload ideas and those ideas can be tested in earthquake in flood in all sorts of austere environments the reason that's important is i don't want to wait for the next katrina to find out if my house works that's too late we need to do it now so doing that globally and i want this whole thing to work when you look at the face of an architect most people think a gray haired white guy i don't see that i see the face of the world fifty three countries we also have designers from around the world that participate and we had an exhibit of work that followed so i want everyone from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this design and development the idea of needs based competitions x prize for the other ninety eight percent if you want to call it that we also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together and the idea of integrating manufacturers fab labs in every country when i hear about the one hundred dollar laptop and it's going to educate every child educate every designer in the world put one in every favela every slum settlement because you know what innovation will happen and i need to know that it's called the leap back we talk about leapfrog technologies i write with worldchanging and the one thing we've been talking about is i learn more on the ground than i've ever learned here so let 's take those ideas adapt them and we can use them you on a journey very quickly to explain the wish i'm going to have to take you somewhere which many people haven't been and that's around the world when i was about twenty four years old these ideas are supposed to have adaptable they're allowed to be they should have the potential for evolution they should be developed by every nation on the world and useful for every nation on the world what will it take there should be a sheet i don't have time to read this because i'm going to be yanked off well what will it take you guys are smart so it's going to take a lot of computing power because i want this to i want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system i want every arup engineer in the world to check and make sure that we're doing stuff that's standing because those guys are the best in the world two thousand and four was the tipping point for us we started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in iran and bam also following up on our work in africa and so you know i want these and i just should note i have two laptops and one of them there is there and that has three thousand designs on it if i drop that laptop what happens so it's important to have these proven ideas put up there easy to use easy to get my mom once said there's nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers fed up of talking about making change you only make it by doing it we've changed fema guidelines we've changed public policy we've changed international response based on building things so for me it's important that we create a real conduit for innovation and that it's free innovation think of free culture this is free innovation somebody said this a couple of years back i will give points for those who know it i think the man was maybe twenty five years too early so let 's do it thank you or go down to alabama or mississippi pre katrina and i could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries i've been to so we got involved in and worked in inner cities and elsewhere and then also i will go into some more projects two thousand and five mother nature kicked our arse i think we can pretty much assume that two thousand and five was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters and because of the internet and because of we run from a couple of laptops in the first couple of days i had four thousand emails from people needing help so we began to get involved in projects there and i'll talk about some others and then of course this year we've been responding to katrina as well as following up on our reconstruction works this is a brief overview in two thousand and four i really couldn't manage the number of people who wanted to help or the number of requests that i was getting it was all coming into my laptop and cell phone so we decided to embrace an open kate store and myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work not only about responding to natural disasters but involved in systemic issues problems are local all solutions are local so and that means you know somebody who is based in in mississippi knows more about mississippi than i do so what happened is we used meetup and all these other kind of internet tools and we ended up having forty chapters starting up thousands of architects in one hundred and four countries so the the bullet point sorry i never do a suit so i knew that i was going to take this off ok because i'm going to do it very quick so the past seven years this isn't just about nonprofit what it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller and that we have the opportunity not the responsibility but the opportunity to really get involved in making change i'm adding that to my time so what you don't know is we've got these thousands of designers working around the world connected basically by a website and we have a staff of three by doing something the fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it we did it and so there's something to be said about naivete so seven years later we've developed so that we've got advocacy instigation and implementation we advocate for good design not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums op we have a book on humanitarian work but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy we can talk about fema but that's another talk we believed that where the resources and expertise are scarce innovative sustainable design can really make a difference in people 's lives a reality until it's built so it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change we build that change so here 's a select number of projects kosovo this is kosovo in ninety nine we did an open design competition like i said it led to a whole variety of ideas and this emergency shelter but transitional shelter that would last five to ten years that would be placed next to the land the resident lived in and that they would rebuild their own home this wasn't imposing an architecture on a community this was giving them the tools and and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow the way they want to we have from the sublime to the ridiculous but they worked this is an inflatable hemp house it was built it works this is a shipping container built and works and a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with architectural building but also the issues of governance and the idea of creating communities through complex networks so we've engaged not just designers but also you know a whole variety of technology based professionals using rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes using so this all began my i started my life as an architect or training as an architect and i was always interested in socially and so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk ten fifteen kilometers to see doctors you get the doctors to the people and we started engaging the the medical community and i thought you know we thought we were real bright you know sparks we've come up with this great idea mobile health clinics that can widely distributed throughout sub saharan africa and the community the medical community there said we 've said this for the last decade we know this we just don't know how to show this so in a way we had taken a pre existing need and shown solutions and so again we had a whole variety of ideas that came in this one i personally love because the idea that architecture is not just about solutions but about raising awareness this is a kenaf clinic you get seed and you grow it in a plot of land and then and it grows fourteen feet in a month and on the fourth week the doctors come and they mow out an area put a tensile structure on the top and when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers you cut down the clinic and you eat it it's an eat your own clinic so it's dealing with the fact that if you have aids you also need to have nutrition rates and the idea that the idea of nutrition is as important as getting anti retrovirals out there so you know this is a serious solution this one i love the idea is it's not just a clinic it's a community center this looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community so it can be a self sustaining project every one of these projects is sustainable you have to know where your energy is coming from you have to know where your resource is coming from and you have to keep the maintenance down so this is about getting an economic engine and then at night it turns into a movie theater so it's not an aids clinic it's a community center so you can see ideas and these ideas from that we also developed siyathemba which was a project the community came to us and said the problem is that the girls don't have education and we're working in an area where young women between the ages of sixteen and twenty four have a fifty percent hiv aids many architects seemed to think that when you design you design a jewel and it's a jewel that you try and crave for whereas i felt that when you design and that's not because they're promiscuous it's because there's no knowledge and so we decided to look at the idea of sports and create a youth sports center that doubled as an hiv aids outreach center and the coaches of the girls team were also trained doctors so that there would be a very slow way of developing they said this is our design because it's not only about engaging a community it's about empowering a community and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process so the winning design is here and then of course we actually go and work with the community and the clients so this is the designer he 's out there working with the first ever women 's soccer team in kwa zulu natal siyathemba and a consultant and i'm also the national also play in for the team called tembisa which has now changed to this is in tanzania and we met literally a couple of months ago we've already developed a design and the team is over there working in partnership this was a matchmaking thanks to a couple of tedsters and andrew zolli who connected me with this amazing african woman and we start construction in june and it will be opened by tedglobal so when you come to tedglobal you can check it out but what we're known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development and we've been involved in a lot of issues such as the tsunami and also things like hurricane katrina this is a three hundred and seventy dollar shelter that can be easily assembled this is a community design a community designed community center and what that means is we actually live and work with the community and they're part of the design process the kids actually get involved in mapping out where the the community center should be and then eventually the community is actually through skills training end up building the building with us here is another school this is what the u n gave these guys for six months twelve plastic tarps this was in august so we said if the rain 's coming down let 's get fresh water so every one of our schools have rain water collection systems very low cost we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in kosovo and i didn't know what i was doing like i say mid twenties it's built by the parents of the kids the kids are out there on site building the buildings and it opened a couple of weeks ago and there's six hundred kids that are now using the schools so disaster hits home we've see the bad stories on cnn and fox and all that but we don't see the good stories here is a community that got together and they said no to wait to waiting they formed a partnership a diverse partnership of to actually map out east biloxi to figure out who is getting involved we've had one thousand five hundred volunteers rebuilding rehabbing homes utility room for a woman who is on a walker she's seventy years old this is what fema gave her six hundred bucks happened two days ago we put together very quickly a washroom it's built it's running and she just started a business today where she's washing other peoples clothes this is the calhouns they're photographers who have documented the lower ninth for the last forty years that was their home and these are the photographs they took and we're helping working with them to create a new building and i'm the i'm the internet generation so we started a website we put a call out there and to my surprise in a couple of months we had hundreds of entries from around the world this is the u n tent this is the new u n tent just introduced this year quick to assemble it's got a flap that's the invention it took twenty years to design this and get it implemented in the field i was twelve years old there's a problem here luckily we're not alone there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds more hemp houses it's a theme in japan this is a grip clip designed by somebody who said all you need is some way to attach membrane structures to physical support beams this guy designed for nasa is now doing housing i'm going to whip through this quickly because i know i've got only a couple of minutes,1,"I'm going to take you on a journey very quickly to explain the wish I'm going to have to take you somewhere which many people have Ambien and that's around the world when I was about 24 years old Kate store myself started an organization to get Architects and designers involved in humanitarian work only about respond to natural disasters that involved in systemic issues. we believe the weather resources and expertise discuss Innovative sustainable design can really make a difference in people's lives. so this all began my side of my life as an architect or training as an architect and I was always interested in socially responsible design and how you can really make an impact when I went to architecture school seems that I was a Black Sheep In The Family many Architects seem to think that when you design you design a jewel and that it's a jewel that you try and pray for me as I felt that when you design you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which were designing in so you're not just doing a building for the residents or all for the people going to use it but for the community as a whole. and in 1999 we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees and Kosovo and I didn't know what I was doing like a say mid-twenties and I'm up on the Internet generation so we started a website we put a call out there and to my surprise in a couple of months we had hundreds of entries from around the world that led to a number of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub-Saharan Africa responding to the HIV aids pandemic. that that led to 550 entries from 53 countries we also have designers from around the world to participate and we had an exhibit of what said that followed that 2004 with a Tipping Point for us we started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in Iran and Bam also following up on an Africa working within the United States most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner but go live I live in Bozeman Montana and go up to the North Plains on the reservations or go down to Alabama or Mississippi pre-katrina and I could have shown you places to have far worse condition than many developing countries have been to so we got involved in and what an innocent he's and elsewhere and then also I will go into some more project 2005 Mother Nature kicked her ass I think we can pretty much assumed that 2005 was a horrific yeah when it comes to natural disasters and. because of the internet and because of connections to blogs and so forth within literally hours of the tsunami we are already raising funds getting involved working with with people on the ground we run from a couple of laptops in the first couple of days I have full thousand emails from people needing help so we began to get involved in projects that and I'll talk about some others and then of course this year we've been responding to Katrina as well as following up on a reconstruction work so this is a brief overview. in 2004 I really couldn't manage the number of people who wanted to help or the number of requests that I was getting it was old coming into my laptop and cell phone so we decided to embrace an open basically an open-source model of business that anyone anyone in the world could start a local chapter and they can get involved in local problems cuz I believe there's no such thing as utopia or problems a local or solutions to local so and that means you know somebody who's faced in in Mississippi knows more about Mississippi than I do so that so what happened is we used meet up and an old is other kind of internet tools and we ended up having 40 chapter starting up thousands of Architects and 100 full countries. so the bullet point sorry never do a suit so I knew that I was going to take self okay cuz I'm going to do is very quick and what it showed me is it that the Grassroots movement going on a socially-responsible design is who really believe that this world has got a lot of small that and then we have the opportunity and not the responsibility with the opportunity to really get involved in making change. I'm adding that to my time. Of three by doing something the fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it we did it I'm so there's something to be said about naivete so seven years later we've developed so that we've got advocacy instigation implementation we advocate for good design the only through student what shops and lectures and public forums allpeds we have a book on humanitarian work but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy we can talk about FEMA but that's another talk instigation developing ideas with communities and ngos doing open-source design competitions matchmaking with communities in implementing actually going out there and doing the work because. when you invent it's never a reality until it's built so it's really important that if we're designing and I'm trying to create change rebuild that change so here's a select number of projects. Kosovo. this is Kosovo in 99 we didn't open design competition like I said it led to a whole variety of of ideas and this wasn't about emergency shelter but transitional shelter that would last five to 10 years that would be placed next to the DeLand resident lived in and that they would rebuild their own home this wasn't imposing an architecture on a community this was giving them the tools and on the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow at the way they want to. we had from the sublime to the ridiculous but they were for this an inflatable hemp house it was built it was this is a shipping container. belt and works on a whole variety of ideas and not only dealt with architectural building but also the issues of governance and the idea of creating communities through complex networks so we can gauge not just design is but also you know a whole variety of a technology-based professionals using Rebel from destroyed homes to create new homes using straw bale construction creating heat walls and then something remarkable happened in 99 as we went to Africa originally to look at the housing issue within 3 days to realize the problem was not housing it was the growing pandemic of hiv-aids just telling us this it was actual Villages that we were staying with and so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk 10:15 km to see doctors you get the doctors to the people and we started engaging that the medical community and I thought. you know spots we've come up with a great idea mobile health clinics that can be widely distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa and the community the medical community that said we said this for the last decade we know this we just don't know how to show this so in a way we had take a pre-existing needs and show no Solutions and so again we had a whole variety of ideas that came in. this one I personally love because the idea of the architecture is not just about Solutions but about raising awareness this is a canal Clinic you get seed and you grow it in a plot of land and then once at a gross 14 ft in the months and then on the 4th week the doctors, they mow out an area for a tenth of structure on the top and when the doctors have finished Rita Ann and seeing patients and Villages you cut down the clinic and you eat it it's an eat your own clinic so it's dealing with the fact that if you have aged you also need to have nutrition rates in the idea that the idea of nutrition is as important as getting antiretrovirals out that so you know this is serious serious solution. this one I love the idea of this is not just the clinic at the community center this so This looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community so it can be a self-sustaining project every one of these projects is a sustainable that's not because I'm a tree-hugging green person it's because when you live on $4 a day you living on survival and you have to be stainable you have to know where your energy coming from you have to know what your resource is coming from and you have to keep the maintenance down so this is this about getting an economic engine and then at night it turns into a movie theater so it's not an AIDS clinic it's it's a community center so you can see ideas. I need ideas that developed into prototypes and they're eventually Bill and currently as of this year there are clinics rolling out in Nigeria and Kenya. from that we also developed the attempt which was the project the community came to us and said the problem is that the girls don't have education and we're working in an area where young women between the ages of 16 and 24 have a 50% hiv-aids right. and it's not because that promiscuous is because there's no knowledge and so we decided to look at the idea of sports and create a youth sport center that doubled as an HIV AIDS Outreach Center and the coaches of the girls team will also trains doctors so that that would be a very slow way of developing kind of confidence in healthcare and we pick nine finalists and then there was nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region and in the community pick their design they said this is our design cuz it's not only about engaging a community is about empowering a community and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process. so the winning design is here. and then of course we actually go and work with the community in the client so this is the designer he's out that working with the first ever women's soccer team in kwazulu-natal see a Tampa and they can tell it better.well my name is CeCe because I work at Africa says about you though. Then a number so the national football player for South Africa by getting my nana and I also play in the league for the team called piece of paper which has now changed to September. so I'm going to share that latex I'm running out of time I can see Chris looking at me fly Lee this was a connection just it's just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop the Africa's first telemedicine center in Tanzania and we met literally a couple of months ago we've already developed to design the team is over that working in Partnership this is a matchmaking thanks to a couple of tests sunshine and Rizzoli who connected me with this amazing African woman and we start construction in June and it will be open by Ted Global so when you come to take Global you can check it out but we know I'm probably most for is dealing with disasters and development and we've been involved in a lot of issues such as. the tsunami and also things like Hurricane Katrina this is a $370 shelter that can be easily assembled. this is a community design Community it signed Community Center and what that means is we actually live and work with the community. and that part of the design process. the kids actually get involved in mapping out whether the the the community center should be and then eventually the community is actually with through skills training and up building a building with us here is another school this is what the UN gave these guys to six months is 12 plastic Tops This was in August this was the replacement is supposed to last for 2 years when the rain comes down you can't hear a thing and in the summer it's about hundred and forty degrees inside so we said if the rain's coming down let's get fresh water so everyone about schools have rainwater collection system very low cost plus three classrooms and rainwater collection is $5,000 this was raised by hot chocolate sales in Atlanta it's built by the parents of the kids the kids are out there on site building the building and it opened a couple of weeks ago and the 600 kids that now using the schools.so does Austin hits home. we seen we see the bad stories on CNN and fox and all that but we don't see the good stories here with the community that got together and they said no to wait it still waiting they formed a partnership diverse Partnership of players to actually map out east Biloxi to figure out who's getting involved we've had over 1,500 volunteers rebuilding rehabbing homes figuring out what female regulations are not waiting for them to dictate to us what how you should rebuild working with resident getting out them out of that home so they don't get ill this is what they cleaning up on their own. designing housing this house is going to go in a couple of weeks this is a rehab home done in 4 days. this is a utility room for a woman who's on a on a walker she 70 years old this is what FEMA gave her. 600 bucks happens two days ago we put together very quickly or washroom it's built it's running and she just started a business today while she's watching other people's clothes this is shaundra and the Calhouns that photographers to a document at the low tonight for the last 40 years that was the Home and these are the photographs they took an done with helping walking with them to create a new building project projects we being a part of support agencies do this. is it that you intend. this is a new UN 10 just introduced this year quick to assemble it's got flat that's the invention. it took twenty years to design this and get it implemented in the field I was 12 years old. there's a problem here. broccoli would not alone there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of Architects and designers and invented around the world that are getting involved in humanitarian work. Mohan houses it's a theme in Japan apparently I'm not sure what that smoking. this is a great clip design by somebody who said all you need is some way to attach membrane structures to physical support beams. this guy designs for for NASA is now doing housing I'm going to whip through this quickly cuz I know I got only a couple of minutes so this is all done in the last two years I showed you something that took 20 years to do and this is just a selection of things that go happened in that were built in the last couple of years from Brazil to India. Mexico. Alabama. China. israel-palestine. Vietnam the average age of a designer whose gets involved in this project is 32 that's how old I am so it's a young. I just have to stop here because Eric is in the room and this is the best design toilet in the world if you ever ever in India go use the toilet. Chris Louboutin will tell you why I'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the potty but.but the future is not going to be the skyscraping cities of New York but this when you look at this you see crisis what I see as many many inventors 1 billion people live in abject poverty we hear about them all the time for Bill Young Living and growing but fragile economies. when is 7 live and unplanned settlements if we do nothing about the housing crisis it's about to happen in twenty years one and three people who live in an unplanned settlement or refugee camp look left look right one of you will be that. how do we improve the living standards of five billion people with 10 million Solutions so I wish to develop a community that actively Embrace of innovative and sustainable design to improve the living conditions for everyone. we started up text yumanity with $700 in a website so Chris somehow decided to give me 100,000 so why not this many people. open source architecture is the way to go you have a diverse community of a participant and we're not just talking about inventors and design is but we talkin about the funding model at my role is not as a designer it's the conduit between the design world in the humanitarian world and what we need is something that replicates me globally because I haven't slept in seven years. secondly what will this thing be designers want to respond to issues of humanitarian crisis but they don't want some company in the west taking their idea and basically frosting from it so creative, since developed the developing nations license I want that means that I design at 10 and we will see you at 10 but project I showed was the first ever building to have a Creative Commons license on it as soon as that is still. anyone in Africa or any developing Nation can take the construction documents and replicate it for free. why not why not allow design at the opportunity to do this but still protecting that right Tia we want to have a community where you can upload the ideas and those ideas going to be tested in an earthquake and flood in all sorts of a steer environments the reason that's important is I don't want to wait for the next Katrina to find out if my house works. that's too late we need to do it now so doing that globally and I want this whole thing to work. multilingual a when you look at the face of an architect most people think a gray had white guy I don't see that I see the face of the world so I want everyone from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this design and development the idea of needs-based competitions X prize for the other 98% if you want to call it that. we also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding Partners together and the idea of integrating manufacturer is Fab Lab than every country when I hear about the $100 laptop and it's going to educate every child advocate every designer in the world put one in every Favela every slum settlement because you know what Innovation will happen and I need to know that it's called the lead back we talked about LeapFrog Technologies I write with well changing and the one thing we've been talkin about it I learned more on the ground than I've ever sent here to let's take those ideas adapt them and we can use them. these itss supposed to have adaptable that are allowed to be late they should have your pain potential for evolution they should be developed by Every Nation on the Weld and and useful for Every Nation on the weld what will it take that should be a sheet I don't have time to read this cuz I'm going to be yanked off so it's going to take a lot of computing power cuz I want this I want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate in in developing these designs but utilized the designs also a process of reviewing the designs I want every hour engineer in the well to check and make sure that we're doing stuff that standing cuz those guys all the best in the world plug and so you know I want these I just should know I have two laptops and one of them that is that is that has 3,000 design. if I drop that laptop. what happens so it's important to have these proven ideas put up that easy to use easy to get ahold of. my mom wants said that's nothing less than being all mouth and no trousers I'm fed up about making change you only make it by doing it we've changed FEMA guidelines we've changed public policy we changed International response based on building things so for me it's important that we create a real conduit for Innovation and then it's free Innovation think of free culture this is free innovation. somebody said this couple of years back. I will get points for those who know it but I think I think the man was maybe 25 years to Wally so let's do it thank you",0.71484375,
83,CameronSinclair_2009G.sph.wav,when the contractors had gone bust as they'd been over leveraged like everyone else the difference is everything goes missing documentation passports and tickets home for these workers currently right now thousands of workers are abandoned there is no way back home and there is no way and no proof of arrival these are the boom and bust refugees the question is as a building professional as an architect if you know this is going on as we go to the sights every single week are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations so let 's forget your environmental footprint let 's think about your ethical footprint what good is it to build a zero carbon energy efficient complex when the labor producing this architectural gem is unethical at best now recently i've been told i've been taking the high road but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road so let 's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse and that as we worry about our next job in the office the next design that we can get to keep our workers years ago my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry in two thousand and six young qatari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps and since then i've followed the let 's not forget these men who are truly dying to work thank you one point one million of them mainly indian pakistani sri lankan and nepalese these laborers risk everything to make money for their families back home they pay a middle man thousands of dollars to be there and when they arrive they find themselves in labor camps with no water no air conditioning and their passports taken away while it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities ninety nine percent of these people are hired by the private sector and so therefore we are equally if not more accountable in august two thousand and eight uae public officials noted that forty percent of the country 's one thousand and ninety eight labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations and last summer more than ten thousand workers protested for the non payment of wages for the poor quality of food and inadequate housing and then the financial collapse happened,1,"so here years ago my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry in 2006 young Qatari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps are the unfolding issue of worker rights in the last six months more than 300 skyscrapers in the UAE of being put on hold or cancelled behind the headlines that lay Behind these buildings is the state of the often indentured construction worker 1.1 million of them. maybe Indian Pakistani Sri Lankan a Nepalese these laborers Risk Everything to make money for their families back home they pay a middleman thousands of dollars to be there when they arrived they find themselves in labor camps with no water no air conditioning and their passports taken away. well as easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities 99% of these people hired by the private sector I'm so that for what equal if not more accountable. groups like build safe UAE have a much but the numbers are simply overwhelming in August 2008 you a public officials noted that 40% of the country's 1098 labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations and lost summer more than 10,000 workers protested for a non-payment of wages for the poor quality of food and inadequate housing and then the financial collapse happened when the contractors have gone bust as they've been over levers like everyone else the difference is everything goes missing documentation passports and tickets home for these workers currently right now 2017. Comb and there's no way a no proof of arrival these are the boom-and-bust refugees the question is has a building professional as an architect and engineer as a developer if you know this is going on cuz we go to the side to everything. are you complacent or complicit in human rights violations. so let's forget your environmental footprint let's think about your ethical Footprints what good is it to build a zero carbon energy efficient complex when the lave of producing this architectural gem is unethical I best not recently I've been told I've been taking the high road but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road so let's not forget who's really paying the price of his financial collapse we worry about our next job in the office in the next to the next design that we can get to keep our Focus let's not forget these men who are truly dying to work thank you",0.8125,
84,CarlHonore_2005G.sph.wav,and what that means is that i don't i no longer overload myself gratuitously my default mode is no longer to be a rush aholic i no longer hear time 's winged chariot drawing near or at least not as much as i did before i can actually hear it now because i see my time is ticking off and the you know salute the sun but only want to give over about twenty minutes to it i mean these are sort of the extreme examples and they're amusing and of all of that is that i actually feel a lot happier healthier more productive than i ever have i feel like i'm i'm living my life rather than actually just racing through it and perhaps the most important measure of the success of this is that i feel that my relationships are a lot deeper richer stronger and for me the i guess the litmus test for whether this would work and what it would mean was always going to be bedtime stories because that's sort of where the the journey began and there too the news is rosy i you know at the end of the day i go into my son 's room i don't wear a watch i switch off my computer so i can't hear the email pinging into the basket and i just slow down to his pace and and we read and because children have their own tempo and internal clock they don't do quality time where you schedule ten minutes for them to open up to you they need you to move at their rhythm i find that ten minutes into a story you know my son will suddenly say you know used to be a kind of a box on my to do list something that i dreaded because it was so slow and i had to get through it quickly it's become my reward at the end of the day something i really i really cherish and i have a kind of hollywood ending to my talk this afternoon which goes a little bit like this a few months ago i was getting ready to go on another book tour and i had my bags packed i was downstairs by the front door character tintin on the front and he said to me or he handed this to me and and i read it and it said to daddy love benjamin and i thought aah that's really sweet you know is a good luck on the book tour card and he said no no no daddy this is a card for being the best story reader in the world and i thought yeah you know this slowing down thing thank you very much of the damage that this roadrunner form of living does to us we're so marinated in the culture of speed that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives on our health our diet our work our relationships the environment and our community and sometimes it takes i'd like to start off with is an observation which is that if i've learned anything over the last year it's that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast a a wake up call doesn't it to to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives instead of actually living them that we're living the fast life instead of the good life and i think for many people that wake up call takes the form of an illness you a burn out or eventually the body says i can't take it anymore and throws in the towel or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we haven't had the time or the patience or the tranquility to be with the other person to listen to them my wake up call came when i started reading bedtime stories to my son and i found that at the end of day i would go into his room and i just couldn't slow down you know i'd be speed reading the cat so we would quarrel and what should have been the most relaxing the most intimate the most tender moment of the day when a dad sits down to read to became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills a clash between his speed and my or my speed and his slowness and this went on for some time until i caught myself scanning a newspaper article with time saving tips for fast people and one of them made reference to a series of books called the one minute bedtime story and i i wince saying those words now but my first reaction at the time was very different my first reflex was to say hallelujah what a great idea this is exactly what i'm looking for to speed up bedtime even more but thankfully a light bulb went on over my head and my next reaction was very different and i took a step back and i thought whoa you know has it really come to this am i really in such a hurry that i'm prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day i seem to spend most of my time these days you know zipping from city to city studio to studio interview to interview serving up the book in really tiny bite size chunks the first was how did we get so fast and the second is is it possible or even desirable to slow down now if you think about how our world got so accelerated the usual suspects rear their heads you think of you know urbanization consumerism the workplace technology but i think if you cut through those forces you get to what might be the deeper driver the nub of the question which is how we think about time itself in other cultures time is cyclical it's seen as moving in great unhurried circles it's always renewing and refreshing itself whereas in the west time is linear it's a finite resource it's always draining away you either use it or lose it time is money as benjamin franklin said and i think what that that does to us psychologically moment of every day into a race to the finish line a finish line incidentally that we never reach but a finish line nonetheless tells us that faster is always better and that busier is best right across the world people are doing the unthinkable they're slowing down and finding that although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down you're roadkill because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down but they want to know how to slow down really quickly so so i did a spot on cnn the other day where i actually spent more time in makeup than i did talking on air the opposite turns out to be true that by slowing down at the right moments people find that they do everything better they eat better they make love better they exercise better they work better they live better and in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration lie what a lot of people now refer to as the international slow movement now if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy a very quick overview of what what's going on inside the slow movement if you think of food many of you will have heard of the slow food movement and more health from our food when we cultivate cook and consume it at a reasonable pace i think also the explosion of organic farming movement and the renaissance farmers markets is another are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable they want to get back to slower rhythms and out of the slow food movement has grown something called the slow cities movement which has started in italy but has spread right across europe and beyond and in this towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape so that people are encouraged to to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another so they might becomes officially a slow city it's kind of like a philosophical declaration it's saying to the rest of world and to the people in that town that we believe that in the twenty one st century slowness has a role to play in medicine i think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned with the kind of quick fix mentality you find in conventional medicine and millions of them around the world are turning to to complementary and alternative forms of medicine and i think that that's not really surprising though is it because that's kind of the world that we we live in now a world stuck in fast forward which tend to tap into sort of slower gentler more holistic forms of healing now obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies and i personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever you know gain mainstream approval other treatments such as acupuncture and massage and even just relaxation clearly have some kind of benefit and blue chip medical colleges everywhere and i saw a magazine a men 's magazine and it said on the front how to bring your partner to orgasm in thirty seconds so you know even sex is on a stopwatch these days now you know i like a quickie as much as the next person but i think that there's an awful lot to be gained from slow sex from slowing down in the bedroom you you tap into that those deeper sort of you know psychological emotional spiritual currents and you get a better orgasm a world obsessed with speed with doing everything faster with cramming more and more into less and less time every moment of the day feels like with the buildup you can get more bang for your buck let 's say i mean the pointer sisters said it most eloquently didn't they when they sang the praises of a lover with a slow hand now we all laughed at sting a few years ago when he went tantric but you fast forward a few years and now you find couples of all ages flocking to workshops or maybe just on their own in their own bedrooms finding ways to put on the brakes and have better sex and of course in italy where i mean italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure they've launched an official slow sex movement the workplace right across much of the world north america being a notable exception working hours have been coming down and europe is an example of that and people finding that their quality of life improves as they're working less and also that their hourly productivity goes up now clearly there are problems with the thirty five hour work week in france too much too soon too rigid but other countries in europe notably the nordic countries are showing that it's possible to have a kick ass economy without being a workaholic and norway sweden denmark and finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on earth and they work the kind of hours that would make the average american weep with envy and if you go beyond sort of the country level down at the micro company level more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to take a lunch break or to go sit in a quiet room to switch off their blackberrys you at the back a race against the clock to borrow a phrase from carrie fisher which is is in my bio there i'll just toss it out again these days even instant gratification takes too long and mobile phones during the work day or on the weekend so that they have time to recharge and to for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought it's not just though these days adults who overwork though is it it's children too i'm thirty seven and my childhood ended in the mid eighties and i look at kids now and i'm just amazed by the way they race around with more homework more tutoring more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago and some of the most heartrending emails that i get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout pleading with me to their parents to help them slow down to help them get off this full throttle treadmill less can be more so there was a case up in scotland recently where a fee paying high achieving private school banned homework for everyone under the age of thirteen and the high achieving parents freaked out and said what are you you know our kids will fall the headmaster said no no your children need to slow down at the end of the day and just this last month the elite universities who are often cited as the reason that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much are starting to notice the caliber of students coming to them is falling these kids have wonderful marks if you think about how we to try to make things better what do we do no we speed them up don't we so we used to dial now we speed dial we used to read now we speed read we used to walk now we speed walk and of course we used to date and now we speed date and so what these ivy league schools and oxford and cambridge and so on are starting to send a message to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit and in harvard for instance they send out a letter to undergraduates freshmen telling them that they'll get more out of life and more out of harvard if they put on the brakes if they do less but give time to things the time that things need to enjoy them to savor them and even if they sometimes do nothing at all and that letter is called very revealing i think slow down with an exclamation mark on the end so wherever you look the message it seems to me is the same that less is very often more that slower is very often better but that said of course it's not that easy to slow down is it i mean you heard that i got a speeding ticket while i was researching my book on the benefits of slowness and that's true but that's not all of it i was actually en route to a dinner held by slow food at the time and if that's not shaming enough i got that ticket in italy and if any of you have ever driven on an italian highway you'll have a pretty good idea of how fast i was going but why is it so hard to slow down i think there are various reasons one is that that speed is fun you know speed is sexy it's all that adrenaline rush it's hard to give it up i think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger deeper questions we fill our head with distraction with so that we don't have to ask am i well am i happy are my children growing up right are politicians making good decisions on my with being stupid i guess what the slow movement the purpose of the slow movement or its main goal really is to tackle that taboo and to say that that yes but the new idea the sort of revolutionary idea of the slow movement is that there is such a thing as good slow too and good slow is you know taking the time to eat a meal with your family with the tv switched off and savor your life now one of the things that i found most uplifting about all of this stuff that's happened around the book since it came out is the reaction to it and i knew that when my book on slowness came out it would be welcomed by the new age brigade but it's also been taken up with great gusto by the corporate world business press but also you know big companies and leadership organizations because people at the top of the chain people like you i think are starting to realize that there's too much another encouraging sign i think is that it's not just in the developed world that this idea 's been taken up in the developing world in countries that are on the verge of making that leap into first world status china brazil thailand poland and so on these countries are have embraced the idea of the slow movement many people in them and there's a debate going on in their media on the streets because i think they're looking at the west and we like that aspect of what you've got but we're not so sure about that so all of that said is it i guess is it possible that's really the main question before us today is it possible to slow down and i i'm happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a resounding yes and i present myself as exhibit a a kind of reformed and rehabilitated speed aholic i still love speed you know i live in london and i work as a journalist and i enjoy the buzz and the busy ness and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things i play,1,"what are the start off with his own observations which is that if if I've learned anything over the last year it's that the the Supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness as you have to go around promoting it really fast I seem to spend most of my time these days shipping from City to City Studio to Studio interview interview serving up the book and Rudy tiny bite-sized chunks because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down but they want to know how to slow down really quickly so I did a spot on CNN the other day where I actually spent more time in makeup and I did talking on there and I think that's not surprising cuz that's kind of the world that we we live in now a world stuck in fast forward a world of sex with speed with doing everything faster with cramming more and more into less and less time for the day feels like a race against the clock to have to borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher which is just in my bio there I'll just toss it out again these days even instant gratification takes too long and. if you think about how we try to make things better what do we do at least we don't have no money so you know we used to dial and I we speed dial we used to read now we speed-read we used to walk now we speed walking course we used to date and that we speeddate even things that are by their very nature slow we try and speed them up to so I was in New York recently and I walked past the gym at the window for a new course in the evening course and it was for you guessed it speed yoga. the perfect solution for X star professionals who want to let you know salute the Sun but only want to give over about 20 minutes to it is a very serious point and I think that in the headlong dash of daily life we we often lose sight of of the damage that this Roadrunner form of living does to us we're still marinating the culture of speed that we do we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives and our health or Diet our work our relationships in the environment and our community and sometimes it takes a a wake-up call doesn't it to to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives instead of that she living them that we are living the fast life instead of the good life and I think for many people that wake-up call takes the form of the illness he knows. He says I can't take it anymore and throws in the towel or maybe relationship goes up in smoke because we haven't had the time or the patience or the train. to be with the other person to listen to them. My wake-up call came when I started reading bedtime stories to my son and I found at the end of the day I would go into his room and I just couldn't Slow Down Speed reading the Cat in the Hat ID be skipping lines here paragraphs there sometimes a whole page of course my little boy knew the book inside out so we would quarrel in what should have been the most relaxing the most intimate the most tender moment of the day when a dad sits down to read to his son it came and said this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills a clash between his speed and my and his slowness and this went on for some time until I caught myself scanning a newspaper article with time-saving tips or fast people in one of them made reference to a series of books called the 1-minute bedtime story. and I I can buy went saying those words now but my first reaction the time was very different my first reflex was to say hallelujah what a great idea this is exactly what I'm looking forward to speed up bedtime even more but thankfully a light bulb went on over my head and my next reaction was very different and I had to step back and I thought well do you know has it really come to this am I really in such a hurry that I'm prepared to fall off my son with the Sound by the end of the day and I put away the newspaper and I go skating on a plane and I sat there I did something I hadn't done for a long time because I did nothing I just thought I thought long and hard and by the time I got off that plane I decided I wanted to do something about it I wanted to investigate this whole Roadrunner culture what it was doing to me and to everyone else and I had two questions in my head the first was how did we get so fast and the second is it possible or even desirable to slow down. now you think about how our world cup to accelerated did The Usual Suspects we are their heads you think of urbanization consumerism the workplace technology those forces you get to what might be the the deeper driver the other than of the question which is how we think about time itself in other cultures time is cyclical it's seen as moving and great. unhurried circles it's always be renewing and refreshing itself or is in the west time is linear it's a finite resource it's always draining away you either use it or lose it this time is money as Benjamin Franklin said and I think what that does to a psychologically is it he creates an equation time is scarce so what do we do well when we speed up don't we we try and do more and more with less and less time we turned every moment of every day into a race to the finish line finish line incidents like that we never reach but Finish Line none the less that is it possible to break free from that mindset and thankfully the answer is yes because what I discovered when I began looking around that there is a global backlash against this culture is it tells us that faster is always better in the busier is bad right across the world people are doing the unthinkable they're slowing down and finding that although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down your road kill the opposite turns out to be true that by slowing down at the. moments people find it they do everything better they eat better they make love better they are exercise better they work better if they live better and in this kind of coldren of moments in places in Acts of deceleration lie with a lot of people now referred to as the international slow movement now if you'll permit me a small Act of hypocrisy. what is a very quick overview of what Sam is what's going on inside the slow movement if you think of food none of you will have heard of the slow food movement started in Italy but has spread across the world and out has 100,000 members in 50 countries and it's driven by a very simple and sensible message which is that we get more pleasure and more Health from our food when we cultivate cook and consume it at a reasonable Pace I think also the explosion of the organic farming movement and the Renaissance a farmers market is another or other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating her food on an industrial timetable they want to get back to slow our rhythms and slow food movement has grown something call the slow cities movement. which has started an illegal to spread right across Europe and and and Beyond and in this town's begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape so that people are encouraged to just slow down and smell the roses connect with one another so they might carve traffic or put in a park bench or some green space and in some ways these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts cuz I think when it's Louis City becomes official philosophical declaration that sang to the rest of the world and to the people in that town that we believe that in the 21st century slowness has a role to play in medicine I take a lot of people are deeply disillusioned with the kind of quick fix mentality find a conventional medicine and millions of them around the world of turning two complementary and Alternative forms of medicine which tend to tap into some slower gentler more holistic forms of healing the jury is out on any of these complementary therapies and I personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever you know game mainstream approve. but other treatments such as an acupuncture and massage relaxation clearly have some kind of benefit in blue-chip medical colleges everywhere are starting to study these things to find out how they work and what we might learn from them sex that's an awful lot of fast sex around in there I was coming too slowly to Oxford and I went through a magazine on the front how to bring your partner to orgasm in 30 seconds so these days I like a quickie as much as the next person but I think it was an awful lot to be gained from slow sex from slowing down in the bedroom you know you tap into that do the deeper psychological emotional spiritual currents and you got a better orgasm with the bill. You'll get more bang for your buck let's say The Pointer Sisters said it most eloquent. they sang the Praises of a lover with a slow hand we all laughed it sting a few years ago when he went tantric but you fast forward a few years and now you'll find couples of all ages flocking to workshops or maybe just on the road and their own bedrooms finding ways to put on the brakes and have better sex and of course it in Italy where to find their pleasure they launched an official slow sex movement. the workplace. right across much of the world North America being a notable exception working hours have been coming down and Europe is an example of that and people finding that their quality of life improves as their working-class and also that their hourly productivity goes up now clearly there are problems with the 35 Hour Work Week in France too much too soon to Rich it but other countries in Europe notably the Nordic countries are showing that it's possible to have a kick-ass economy without being a workaholic and Norway Sweden and Denmark and Finland now ranked among the top six most competitive Nations on Earth and they work the kind of ours that would make the average American weep with envy and if you go beyond Sodor the the country-level down at the the micro company-level more and more companies are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to unplug to take a lunch break or to go sit in a quiet room to to switch off there blackberries and laptops you at the back mobile. phones during the workday or on the weekend so that they have time to recharge and two for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought. it's not just do these days adults who wrote the work that we did his children to I'm 37 and my childhood ended in the mid-80s and I look at it now and I'm just amazed by the way they race around with more homework more tutoring more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago and some of the most heart-rending emails that I get on my website are actually from adolescence hovering on the edge of burnout pleading with me to write to their parents to help them slow down to help him get off this Full Throttle treadmill but thankfully there is a backlash there were in parenting is well and you're finding that you have towns in United States are not banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month so the people can take me to decompress and and have some family time and slow down. homework is another thing of their homework bands springing up all over the developed world and schools which have been piling on the homework for years and now they're discovering the less can be more so there's a cop in Scotland recently were feed paying high-achieving private school band homework for everyone under the age of 13 and the high cheating parents freaked out and said what do you mean our kids with the Headmaster said none of your children need to slow down at the end of the day and just this last month the exam results came in and in math science marks went up 20% on average last year and I think it's very revealing the elite universities who are often cited as the reason that people drive their kids a Hothouse them so much are starting to notice the caliber of students coming to them is falling these kids have wonderful marks they have Steve he's jammed with extracurriculars the point that would make your eyes water but they lacked spark they lack the ability to think creatively outside like they don't know how to dream. and to what these Ivy League schools in Oxford and Cambridge in summer starting to send a message to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit in Harvard for instance they send out a letter to undergraduates track freshman telling them that you'll get more out of life and we're at a Harvard if they if they put on the brakes if they did they do last but give time to things the time that things need to enjoy them to save them and even if they sometimes do nothing at all and that letter is called very revealing I think slow down with an! On the end so wherever you look beat the message it seems to me is the same that less is very often more that slower it's very often better but that said of course it's it's not that easy to slow down as if I mean you heard that I got a speeding ticket while I was researching my book on the benefits of Sloan is not true but that's not all of it I was actually en route to a dinner held by slow food at the time I got that ticket in Italy and if any of you ever driven on Italian Highway you have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going. but why is it so hard to slow down I think there are various reasons one is it the speed is fun you know speed of sexy at all that Adrenaline Rush it's hard to give it up I think there's a metaphysical to mention that speed becomes a way of ruling ourselves off from the bigger deeper question we fill our heads with distraction with dizziness so we don't have to ask am I well I might happy are my children growing up right politicians making good decisions on my behalf another reason why I think perhaps even the most powerful reason why we find it hard to slow down to the cultural taboos that we directed against going down to slow the dirty word and our culture's to buy word for lazy slacker for being somebody who gives up you know she's a bit slow sexy synonymous with being with being stupid I guess what the movie the purpose of a slow-moving his main goal really is to tackle that too boo and to say that but yes. sometimes slow is not the eating at the answer that there is such a thing as bad slow and I got stuck on the pin on the M25 which of the Ring Road around London recently and spent three and a half hours then I can tell you that's really bad slow but the new idea the sort of revolutionary idea of the slow movement is there such a thing as good slow to and could slow is taking the time to eat a meal with your family with the TV Switched Off for taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision at work or even simply just taking the time to slow down. and Savor your life what are the things that I found most uplifting about all of this stuff that's happened around of the books into came out is is the reaction to it and I end up my book on Sloan is came out it would be welcomed by the new age Brigade but it's also been taken up with Great Gusto by the corporate world in as soon as the business press but also in a big companies and Leadership organization because people at the top of the chain people like you I think they're starting to realize that there's too much speed in the system there's too much business and it's time to find or get back to that lost art of shifting gears. another encouraging sign I think it's it's not just in the developed world of ideas being taken up in the in the developing world and countries are on the verge of making that leap in the first world state is China Brazil Thailand Poland and so on these countries are embraced the idea of the slow movement many many people in them going on in their media on the street because I think they're looking at the wax and if we like that aspect of what your you got but we're not so sure about that so I guess is it possible that's the main question before us today is it possible to dislocate down and and I am happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a resounding yes and I present myself as as exhibit a kind of reformed and rehabilitated beadaholique. I still love speed and I live in London and I worked as a journalist and I enjoy the buzz and the business and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things I buy play squash and I talk to you too very fast forward and I wouldn't give him up for the world but I've also over the last year or so got in touch with my inner tortoise. and what that means is that I don't I no longer overload myself gratuitously my default mode is no longer to be a Russia Hall. I no longer hear time's winged Chariot Drawing Near or at least not as much as I did before I can hear it now cuz I see my time is ticking off of all of that it said I actually feel a lot happier and healthier more productive than I ever have I feel like I'm living my life rather than that she just racing through it and press the most important measure of the success of this is that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper richer stronger and and for me to get the litmus test for whether this would work and what it would mean was always going to be bedtime stories cuz that's sort of where the the journey began and their to the news is is Rosie I got the end of the day I go into my son's room I don't wear watch switch off my computer so I can't hear the email thing at the basket and I just slow down to his Payson and we read it because children have their own Tempo and internal clock they don't. quality time with you schedule 10 minutes for them to open up to you they need you to move at their Rhythm I find a 10 minutes into a story you know my son will suddenly say you know something warm and we'll go off and have a conversation on that and I'll find it bedtime stories. used to be a kind of a box of my to do list something that I'd read it because it was so slow and I had to get to it quickly it become my reward at the end of the day something I really I really cherish and I have a Hollywood ending to my talk this afternoon which goes a little bit like this a few months ago I was getting ready to go on another book to her and I had my bags packed I was downstairs by the front door and was waiting for taxi my son came down the stairs and he he made a card for me and just carrying that he's going and stapled to cards right like these together and put a sticker of his favorite character Tintin on the front and keep he said to me but he had it as men and and I read it it said to Daddy love Benjamin and I thought all that's that's really sweet you know a good luck on the book tour card and he said no no no Daddy this is a card for being the best Story Reader in the world and I thought yeah you know this slowing down thing really does work thank you very much",0.72265625,
85,CarlSafina_2010X.sph.wav,we should just get rid of them but in the entire rest of government right now and for the last at least thirty years there has been a culture of deregulation that is caused directly by the people who we need to be protected from buying the government out from under us complained that they were already bidding defiance to the laws of our country they would tell these corporations to go to hell that's what it would really mean to be conservative so what we really need to do is regain the idea that it's our government all the fossil fuels have changed the atmosphere greatly carbon dioxide level has gone up and up and up we're warming the climate i think there are signs of hope we seem to be waking up a little bit the glass steagall act which was really to protect us from the kind of thing that caused the recession to happen now there's a mood to put some of that stuff back in place but the lobbyists are all ready there trying to weaken the regulations after the legislation has just passed so it's a continued fight it's a historic moment right now we're either going to have an absolutely unmitigated catastrophe of this oil leak in the gulf or we will make the moment we need out of this as many people have noted today there's certainly a common theme about needing to make the moment out of this we've been through this before with other ways of offshore drilling the first now are we stuck with this ever since we lived in caves every time we wanted any energy we lit something on fire and that is still what we're doing we're still lighting something on fire every time we want energy and people say we can't have clean energy because it's too expensive so the blowout in the gulf is just a little piece of a much larger problem that we have with the energy that we use to run civilization who says it's too expensive people who sell us fossil fuels we've been here before with energy and people saying the economy cannot withstand a switch because the cheapest energy was slavery energy is always a moral issue it's an issue that is moral right now it's a matter of right and wrong thank you very much beyond warming we have the problem of the oceans getting more acidified and already measurably so and already effecting animals now in the laboratory if you take a clam and you put it in the ph that is not eight point one which is the normal ph of seawater but seven point five it dissolves in about three days if you take sea urchin larva from eight point one put it in a ph of seven point seven not a huge change it becomes deformed and dies and already coral reefs are growing slower in some places because of this problem so this really matters now let 's take a little tour around the gulf a little bit the ocean as i used to know things that really impresses me about the people in the gulf they are really really aquatic people and they can handle water they can handle a hurricane that comes and goes when the water goes down they know what to do but when it's something other than water and their water habitat changes they don't have many options in fact those entire communities really don't have and i find that since i've been in the gulf a couple of times i really kind of am traumatized because whenever i look at the ocean now no matter where i am many options they don't have another thing they can do they can't go and work in the local hotel business because there isn't one in their community if you go to the gulf and you look around you do see a lot of oil you see a lot of oil on the ocean you see a lot of oil on the shoreline if you go to the site of the blowout it looks pretty unbelievable it looks like you just emptied the oil pan in your car and you just dumped it in the ocean and one of the really most incredible things i think is that there's nobody out there trying to collect it at the site where it is densest parts of the ocean there look just absolutely apocalyptic you go in along the shore you can find it everywhere it's really messy if you go to the places where it's just arriving like the eastern part of the gulf in alabama there's still people using the beach while there are people cleaning up the beach and they have a very strange way of cleaning up the beach they're not allowed to put more than ten lbs of you see people who are really shell shocked they are very hardworking people all they know about life is they get up in the morning and if their engine starts they go to work they always felt that they could rely on the assurances that nature brought them through the ecosystem of the gulf and they're finding that their world is really collapsing and so you can see literally signs of even where i know none of the oil has gone i sort of see slicks and i'm finding that i'm very much haunted their shock signs of their outrage signs of their anger and signs of their grief these are the things that you can see and and i learned in fact i confirmed the hypothesis that oil and water don't mix until you add a dispersant and then they start mixing and you add a little energy from the wind and the waves and you get a big mess by it a big mess that you can't possibly clean you can't touch you can't extract and i think most importantly this is what i think you can't see it i think it's being hidden on purpose now this is such a catastrophe and such a mess but what i want to talk to you about today is a lot of things that try to put all of this in context not just about the oil eruption but that lots of stuff is leaking out on the edges of the information stream but as many people have said there's a large attempt to suppress what's going on personally i think that dispersants are a major strategy to hide the body because we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene but you can see it you can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface and then it is attacked because they don't want the evidence in my opinion okay we heard that bacteria eat oil so do sea turtles when it breaks up it has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria turtles eat it it gets in the gills of fish these guys have to swim around through it i heard the most incredible story today when i was on the train coming here a writer named ted williams called me and he was asking me a couple of questions about what i saw because he 's writing an article for audubon magazine he said that he had been in the gulf a little while ago like about a week ago and a guy who had been a recreational fishing guide took him out to show him what's going on that guide 's entire calendar year is ted that on the last day he went out a bottlenosed dolphin suddenly appeared next to the boat and it was splattering oil out its blowhole what it means and why it has happened first just a little bit about me i'm basically just a guy that likes to go fishing ever since i was a little kid and he now in the exxon valdez spill about thirty percent of the killer whales died in the first few months their numbers have never recovered so the recovery rate of all this stuff is going to be variable it's going to take so the gulf is a really important piece of water more important than a similar volume of water in the open atlantic ocean and because i did i wound up studying sea birds to try to stay in the coastal habitats that i so loved very much right in the area of the slick they're probably having at the very least a catastrophic spawning season this year i'm hoping that maybe the adults are avoiding that dirty water they don't usually like to go into water that is very cloudy anyway but these are really high performance athletic animals i don't know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills i don't know if it'll effect the adults if it's not it's certainly effecting their eggs and larvae i would certainly think i think it's important to keep in mind that we've done a lot to effect what's in the ocean for a very very long time it's not like we're starting with something that's been okay we're starting with something that's had a lot of stresses and a lot of problems to begin with if you look around at the birds there are a lot of birds in the gulf that concentrate in the gulf at certain times of the year but then leave and they populate much larger areas and now i mainly write books about how the ocean is changing and the ocean is certainly changing very rapidly now we saw this kind of graphic earlier on so for instance most of the birds in this picture are migratory birds they were all on the gulf in may while oil was starting to come ashore in certain places down on the lower left there are ruddy turnstones and sanderlings they breed in the high arctic and they winter down in southern south america but they so this is a hemispheric issue the economic effects go at least nationally in many ways the biological effects are certainly hemispheric i think that this is one of the most absolutely mindboggling examples of total unpreparedness that i can even think of even when the japanese bombed pearl harbor at least they shot back and we just seem to be unable to figure out what to do there was nothing ready and you know as we can see by what they're doing mainly what they're doing is booms and dispersants the booms are absolutely not made for open water they don't even attempt to corral the oil where it is most concentrated they get near shore look at these two boats that one on the right is called fishing fool and i think you know that's a great name for boats that they're going to do anything to make a dent in this by dragging a boom between them when there are literally hundreds of thousands of square miles in the gulf right now with oil at the surface the dispersants make the oil go right under the booms the booms are only about thirteen inches in diameter that we really live on a hard marble that has just a slight bit of wetness to it it's like you dipped a marble in water so it's just absolutely crazy here are shrimp boats employed there are hundreds of shrimp boats employed to drag booms instead of nets here they are working you can see easily that all the oily water just goes over the back of the boom all they're doing is stirring it it's just ridiculous also for all the shoreline that has booms hundreds and hundreds of miles of shoreline all of the shoreline that has booms there's adjacent shoreline that doesn't have any booms there is ample opportunity for oil and dirty water to get in behind them and that lower photo that's a bird colony that has been boomed everybody 's trying trying to protect the bird colonies there well as an ornithologist i can tell you that birds fly and that and that booming a bird colony doesn't do it it doesn't do it these birds make a living by diving into the water in fact really what i think they should do if anything they're trying so hard to protect those nests actually if they destroyed every single nest some of the birds would leave and that would be better for them this year and the same thing with the atmosphere if you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball you would get that little sphere of gas on the right so we live as far as cleaning them i don't mean to cast any aspersion on people cleaning birds it's really really important that we express our compassion i think that's the most important thing that people have is compassion it's really important to get those images and to show it but really where are those birds going to get released to it's like taking somebody out of a burning building treating them for smoke inhalation and sending them back into the building because the oil is still gushing to acknowledge this as anything like an accident i think that this is the result of gross negligence not just b p b p operated very and very recklessly because they could and they were allowed to do so because of the absolute failure of oversight of the government that's supposed to be our government protecting us it turns out that you see this sign on almost every commercial vessel in the united states you know if you spilled a couple of gallons of oil you would be in big trouble and you have to really wonder who are the laws made for and who has gotten above the laws now there are things that we can do in the future we could have the kinds of equipment that we would really need it would not take an awful lot to anticipate that after making thirty thousand holes in the sea floor of the gulf of mexico looking for oil on the most fragile little soap bubble you can imagine a very sacred soap bubble but one that is very very easy to effect and all the burning of oil and coal and gas oil might start coming out of one of them and you'd have some idea of what to do that's certainly one of the things we need to do but i think we have to understand where this leak really started from it really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there because it's our government meant to protect the larger public interest so i think that the oil blowout the bank bailout the mortgage crisis and all these things are absolutely symptoms of the same cause we still seem to understand that at least we need the police to protect us from a few bad people and even though the police can be a little annoying at times giving us tickets and stuff like that nobody says that,1,this is the ocean as I Used to Know It. and I find that since I've been in the Gulf a couple of times I I really kind of am traumatized because whenever I look at the ocean now no matter where I am even when I know that none of the oil has gone I sort of see slicks and it's I am finding that I'm very much haunted by it. but what I want to talk to you about today is a lot of things that try to put all of this in context not just about the oil a ruption but what it means and why it has happened first just a little bit about me I'm basically just a guy that likes to go fishing ever since I was a little kid and because I did I wanted up studying seabirds to try to stay in the coastal habitats that I so loved and now I mainly write books about how the ocean is changing and the ocean is certainly changing very rapidly that we saw this kind of graphic earlier on that we really live on a hard marble that has just a slight bit of wetness to it it's like you dip the marble in water and the same thing with the atmosphere if you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball you would get that little sphere of gas on the right so we live on the most fragile little soap bubble you can imagine a very sacred soap bubble but one that is very very. free easy to effect and all of the burning of oil and coal and gas all the fossil fuels have changed the atmosphere greatly carbon dioxide level has gone up and up and up we're warming the climate so the blow out in the Gulf is just a little piece of a much larger problem that we have with the energy that we used to run civilization Beyond warming we have the problem of the oceans getting more acidified and already measurably so and already affecting animals now in the laboratory if you take a clam and you put it in the pH that is not 8.1 which is the normal pH of seawater but 7.5 it dissolves in about 3 days if you take the sea urchin larvae from 8.1 put it in a pH of 7.7 not if you would change it becomes deformed and dies and already. commercial oyster larvae are dying at large scales in some places coral reefs are growing slower in some places because of this problem so this really matters now let's take a little tour around the golf a little bit 10 things that really impresses me about the people in the golf they are really really aquatic people and they can handle water they can handle a hurricane that comes and goes when the water goes down they know what to do but when it's something other than water and their water habitat changes they don't have many options in fact those entire communities really don't have many options they don't have another thing they can do they can't go and work in the local hotel business because there isn't one in their community. if you go to the gulf and you look around you do see a lot of oil you see a lot of oil on the ocean you see a lot of oil on the shoreline if you go to the site of the blow out it looks pretty unbelievable it

just arriving like the eastern part of the gulf in Alabama that are still people using the beach while they're people cleaning up the beach and have a very strange way of cleaning up the beach you're not allowed to put more than 10 lb of sand in a 50 gallon plastic bag that has thousands and thousands of plastic bags I don't know what they're going to do with all that stuff meanwhile there are people still trying to use the beach they don't see the little tiny sign that says stay out of the water their kids are in the water they're getting tar all over their clothes and their sandals it's a mess if you go to the place where the oil has been awhile it's an even bigger mess and it's basically nobody there any more few people trying to keep using it you see people who are really Shell Shocked they are very hardworking people they know about life as they get up in the morning and if they're engine starts they go to work. they always felt that they could rely on the assurances that nature brought them through the ecosystem of the gulf and they're finding that their world is really collapsing and so you can see literally signs of their shock. signs of their outrage. signs of their anger. and signs of their grief. these are the things that you can see. is a lot you can't see also underwater. what's going on under water well. some people say they're oil plumes some people say there are not oil plumes. and Congressman or he asked you know is it going to take a submarine ride to see if there are really loyal to me but I couldn't take a submarine ride especially between the time I knew I was coming here and today so I had to do a little experiment myself to see if there was oil in the Gulf of Mexico so this is the Gulf of Mexico. sparkling Place full of fish. and I created a little oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. and I learned in fact I confirm the hypothesis that oil and water don't mix. until you add a dispersant. and then. they start mixing. and you're at a little energy from the wind and the waves and you get a big mess a big mess that you can't possibly clean you can't touch you can't extract and I think most importantly this is what I think you can't see it I think it's being hidden on purpose now this is such a catastrophe in such a mess that lots of stuff is leaking out on the edges of the information stream but as many people have said there's

you can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface and then it is attacked because they don't want the evidence in my opinion okay sweetheart that bacteria etoile so do sea turtles when it breaks up a has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria turtles eat it it gets in the gills of fish these guys have to swim around through it I heard the most incredible story today when I was on the train coming here a writer named Ted Williams called. and he was asking me a couple of questions about what I saw because he's writing an article for Audubon magazine he said that he had been in the Gulf a little while ago like about a week ago and a guy who had been a recreational fishing guide took him out to show him what's going on that guides entire calendar year is canceled bookings he has no bookings left everybody wanted their deposit back everybody is fleeing that's the story of thousands of people but he told. Ted that on the last day he went out a bottlenose dolphin suddenly appeared next to the boat and it was splattering or oil out its blowhole. and he moved away because it was his last fishing trip. any new that the Dolphins scare fish so he moved away from it turned around a few minutes later it was right next to the side of the boat again he said that in thirty years of fishing he had never seen a dolphin do that and he felt that. felt that it was coming to ask for help. now in. in the Exxon Valdez spill about 30% of the killer whales died in the first few months their numbers have never recovered so the recovery rate of all this stuff is going to be a variable it's going to take longer for some things and some things I think we'll probably come back a little faster the other thing about the gulf that is important is that they're a lot of animals that concentrate in the Gulf at certain parts of the year to the gulf is a really important piece of water more important than a similar volume of water in the open at Atlantic Ocean swim the entire ocean to get into Gulfstream to go all the way to Europe when it comes time to spawn they come inside and these two tuna that were tagged you can see them on the spawning grounds very much right in the area of the Slick they're probably having at the very least a catastrophic spawning season this year I'm hoping that maybe the adults are avoiding. that dirty water they don't usually like to go into water that is very cloudy anyway but these are really high performance athletic animals I don't know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills I don't know if it'll affect the adult if it's not it's certainly affecting their eggs and larvae I would certainly think but if you look at that graph that goes down and down and down that's what we've done to this species through overfishing over many decades so while the oil spill the leak the eruption is a catastrophe I think it's important to keep in mind that we've done a lot to affect what's in the ocean for a very very long time not like we're starting with something that's been okay starting with something that had a lot of stress is in a lot of problems to begin with you look around at the birds there are a lot of birds in the Gulf that concentrate in the Gulf at certain times of the year but then leave and they populate much larger areas. so for instance most of the birds in this picture or migratory Birds they were all in the Gulf in May while oil was starting to come ashore in certain places down on the lower left there there are already turn stones in sanderlings they breed in the high Arctic and they winter down in southern South America but they concentrate in the gulf and then fan out all across the Arctic I saw birds that breathing Greenland in the Gulf. so this is a hemispherical issue the economic effects go at least nationally in many ways the biological effects are certainly hemispheric. I think that this is one of the most absolutely mind-boggling examples of total unpreparedness that I can even think of even when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor at least a shot back and we just seem to be unable to figure out what to do there was nothing ready and you know as we can see by what they're doing mainly what they're doing is blum's in dispersants the booms are absolutely not made for Open Water they don't even attempt to Corral the oil where is most concentrated they getting your sure look at these two boats that one on the right is called fishing fool and I think you know that's a great name for both to think that they're going to do anything to make a dent in this by dragging a boom between them when there are literally hundreds of thousands of square miles in the Gulf right now with oil at the surface it dispersants. make sure you all go right under the Booms The booms are only about 13 in in diameter. so it's just absolutely crazy here are shrimp boats employed there 100 shrimp out employed to drag booms instead of nuts here they are working you can see easily that all the oily water just goes over the back of the boom all they're doing is stirring it it's just ridiculous. also for all the shoreline that has boomed hundreds and hundreds of miles of Shoreline all the shoreline that has blooms is adjacent Shoreline it doesn't have any booms there is ample opportunity for oil and dirty water to get in behind them in that lower photo that's a bird Colony that has been boomed everybody's trying to protect the bird colonies their well as an ornithologist I can tell you that birds fly and that. and that booming a bird Colony doesn't do it it doesn't do it these birds make a living by diving into the water. in fact. really what I think they should do if anything they're trying so hard to protect those nests actually if they destroyed every single Nest some of the birds would leave and that would be better for them this year. far as cleaning them. I don't mean to cast any aspersion on people cleaning Birds it's really really important that we express our compassion I think that's the most important thing that people have his compassion it's really important to get those images and to show it but really where those birds going to get released to it's like taking somebody out of a burning building treating them for smoke inhalation and sending them back into the building because the oil is still gushing. I refuse to acknowledge this as anything like an accident I think that this was the result of gross negligence. not just BP BP operated very sloppily and very recklessly because they could and they were allowed to do so because of the absolute failure of oversight of the government that is supposed to be our government protecting us. it turns out that you see this sign on almost every commercial vessel in the United States you know if you spilled a couple of gallons of oil you would be in big trouble and you have to really wonder who are the laws made for and who has gotten above the laws other things that we can do in the future we could have the kind of equipment that we would really need it would not take an awful lot to anticipate that after making 30 thousand holes in the sea floor of the Gulf of Mexico looking for oil oil my start coming out of one of them and you'd have some idea of what to do that's certainly one of the things we need to do but I think we have to understand where this leak really started from. it really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there because it's our government man to protect the larger public interest. so I think that the oil blow out the bank bailout the mortgage crisis and all these things are absolutely symptoms of the same cause. we still seem to understand that at least we need the police to protect us from a few bad people and even though the police can be a little annoying at times giving us tickets and stuff like that nobody says that we should just get rid of them but in the entire rest of government right now and for the last at least 30 years there has been a culture of deregulation that is caused directly by the people who we need to be protected from buying the government out from under us. this has been a problem for a very very long time you can see that corporations were illegal at the founding of America and even Thomas Jefferson complained that they were already bidding Defiance to the laws of our country. okay people who say they're conservative if they really wanted to be really conservative and really patriotic they would tell these corporations to go to hell that's what it would really mean to be conservative. so what we really need to do is regain. the idea that it's our government safeguarding our interest and regain a sense of unity and common cause in our country that really has been lost. I think there are signs of hope we seem to be waking up a little bit the glass-steagall ACT which was really to protect us from the kind of thing that caused the recession to happen and the bank meltdown I know all that stuff that required the bail out that was put in effect in 1933 was systematically destroyed now there's a mood to put some of that stuff back in place but the lobbyists are already they are trying to weaken the regulations after the legislation has just passed so it's a continued fight it's a historic moment right now we're either going to have an absolutely unmitigated catastrophe of this oil leak in the Gulf or we will make the moment we need out of this as many people have noted today there's certainly a common theme about needing to make the moment out of this we've been through this before with other ways of offshore drilling the first offshore Wells were called Wales the first offshore drills were called harpoons we emptied the ocean of the. sales at that time now are we stuck with this ever since we lived in caves every time we wanted any energy we lit something on fire and that is still what we're doing we're still lighting something on fire every time we want energy and people say we can't have clean energy because it's too expensive who says it's too expensive people who sell us fossil fuels we've been here before with energy and people saying the economy cannot withstand a switch because the cheapest energy was slavery energy is always a moral issue it's an issue that is moral right now it's a matter of right and wrong thank you very much. a very funny. you got me.we are Intel sponsors of tomorrow,0.7942708134651184,

Papi help I already had your mother I think she's right. after what I just told you my whole life my father has been there so we talked a few minutes but we don't have the time. good storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to Greg story is the Art of Letting Go. I want to tell you a little story. remember this tradition comes to us not from The Mists of Avalon back in time but further still before he was scratching out the stories on Papyrus we were doing the pictographs on invoice damp caves. back then we had an urgent need to tell the story when Alexis wants to sell you a car they're telling you a story I've been watching the commercial. because every one of us has his desire for once just once to tell our story and have it heard. the stories you tell from stages. they're stories that you may tell in a small group of people with some good wine and their stories to tell. late at night to a friend. maybe once in your life. and then are the stories. we whisper into a stygian Darkness.

I think I'm kind of cute. baby horses horse baby so I say bye..you should be terrified kind of like a cat fat in back of mouth so you said yes alright then you know that you turn on the brake lights just as you pull up behind them but that doesn't happen most of the time right now. why are we here today it's Saturday for holidays because I have to. nothing is going to Macedonian thinking that you really have to get on my mind it's a rabbit's Warren This Woman's line do I want to walk in Because unless I have ariadne's thread somewhere I may not get out but you know. why do we have to take pops on the way back now and why what is wrong with his underwear. it will upset you. what is an idiot. my family say. and he bought the grippers and he supposed to buy the boxers why you cannot have children.

87,CarneRoss_2009P.sph.wav,interstate conflict today eighty percent of the agenda of the u n security council is about conflicts within states and when i look back on my time at the security council and what happened with the kosovars and i realize that often the people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the security council weren't actually actually invited to give their views to the security council i thought this is wrong something 's got to be done about this so i started off in a traditional me and my colleagues at independent diplomat went around the u n security council we went around seventy u n member states the kazaks the ethiopians the israelis you name them we went to see them more effective and durable you would think i mean incredibly logical so obvious anybody could it and of course everybody got it everybody went yes of course your absolutely right come back to us in maybe six months i was fascinated by the cold war by the inf negotiations over intermediate range nuclear missiles the proxy war between the soviet union and the u s in angola or afghanistan so we looked at that observation of basically failure and thought what can we do about it and i thought if i'm going to spend the rest of my life lobbying for these crumby governments to do what needs to be done so what we're going to do is we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves so now independent diplomat is in the process of setting up meetings between the u n security council and the parties to the disputes that are on the agenda of the security council so we will be bringing darfuri rebel the northern cypriots and the southern cypriots rebels from and awful long laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world and we will be trying to bring the parties to new york to sit down in a quiet room in a private setting with no press and actually explain what they want to the members of the u n security council of course describing all this any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult and i entirely agree with you the chances of failure are very high if we don't try to make it happen and my politics has changed fundamentally from when i was a diplomat to what i am today and i think that outputs is what matters not process not technology frankly so much and in a way independent diplomat embodies that fragmentation that change that is happening to all of us these things really interested me and so i decided quite at an early age i wanted to be a diplomat and i one day i announced this to my parents and my father denies this story to this day i said daddy i want to be a diplomat and he turned to me and he said carne you have to be very clever i entered the british foreign service that year five thousand people applied to become a diplomat and twenty of us succeeded and as those numbers suggest i was inducted into an elite and fascinating and exhilarating world my story is a little bit about war it's about disillusionment it's about death and it's about rediscovering idealism being a diplomat then and now is an incredible job and i loved every minute of it i enjoyed the status of it i bought myself a nice suit and wore leather soled shoes and reveled in this amazing access i had to world events i traveled to the gaza strip i headed the middle east peace process section in the british foreign ministry i became a speechwriter for the british foreign secretary i met yasser arafat i negotiated with saddam 's diplomats at the u n later i traveled to kabul and served in afghanistan after the fall of the taliban and i would travel in a c one hundred and thirty transport and visit warlords in mountain hideaways and negotiate with them about how we were going to eradicate al qaeda from dangerous and that was exciting that was fun it was really interesting and but i was posted to new york to serve on the u n security council for the british delegation and my responsibility was the middle east which was my specialty and there i dealt with things like the middle east peace process the lockerbie issue we can talk about that later if you wish but above all my responsibility was iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons i was the chief british negotiator on the subject and i was steeped in the issue and anyway it was kind of a very exciting time i mean it was very dramatic diplomacy we went through several wars during my time in new york i negotiated for my country the resolution in the security council of the twelfth of september two thousand and one condemning the attacks of the day before which were of course deeply present to us actually living in new york at the time so it was kind of the best of time worst of times kind of experience i lived the high life i worked very long hours i lived in a penthouse in union square i was a single british diplomat in new york city you can imagine what that might have meant i had a good time in two thousand and two when my tour came to an end i decided i wasn't going to go back to the job that was waiting for me in london i decided to take a sabbatical in fact at the new school bruce in some inchoate inarticulate way i realized that there was something wrong with my work with me i was exhausted and i was also disillusioned in a way i couldn't quite put my finger on and i decided to take some time out from work the foreign office was very generous you could take these special unpaid leave as they called them and yet remain part of the diplomatic service but not actually do any work i was nice and eventually i decided to take a secondment to join the u n in kosovo which was then under u n administration and two things happened in kosovo which kind of again shows the randomness of life because these things turned out to be two of the pivots of my life and helped to deliver me to the next stage but they were random things one was that in the summer of two thousand and four the british government somewhat reluctantly decided to have an official inquiry into the use of intelligence on wmd in the run up to the iraq war a very limited subject and i testified to that inquiry in secret i had been steeped in the intelligence on iraq and its wmd and my testimony to the inquiry said three things that i don't believe in straightforward narratives i don't believe in a life or history written as decision a led to consequence b led to consequence c these neat narratives that we're presented with the government exaggerated the intelligence which was very clear in all the years i'd read it and indeed our own internal assessment was very clear discreditable thing still the third reason i won 't go into but anyway i gave that testimony and that presented my with a crisis what was i going to do this testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues of my ministers and so i was in crisis and this wasn't a pretty thing it i hesitated i went on and on and on to my long suffering wife and eventually i decided to resign from the british foreign service i felt in the al pacino movie the insider which you may know where he goes back to cbs after they've let him down the tobacco guy and he goes you know i just can't do this anymore something 's broken and it was like that for me i love that movie i felt just something 's broken i can't actually sit with my foreign minister or my prime minister again with a smile on my face and do what i used to do gladly for them so took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff and it was a very very uncomfortable unpleasant feeling and i started to fall and today that fall hasn't stopped i'm still falling but in a way i've got used to the sensation of it and in a way i kind of like the sensation of it a lot better than i like actually standing on top of the cliff wondering what to do a second thing happened in kosovo which kind of i need a quick gulf of water forgive me a second thing happened in kosovo which kind of delivered the answer which i couldn't really answer which is and that perhaps we encourage in each other i believe in randomness and one of the reasons i believe that is because me becoming a diplomat was random what do i do with my life i love diplomacy i have no career i expected my entire life to be a diplomat to be serving my country i wanted to be an ambassador my mentors my heroes in march two thousand and four there were terrible riots all over the province as it then was of kosovo eighteen people were killed it was will stop is when they decide to stop and when they've had enough burning and killing and that is not a very nice feeling to see and i saw it and i went through it i went through those mobs and with my albanian friends we tried to stop it but we failed me something which isn't immediately obvious and it's kind of a complicated story but one of the reasons that riot took place those riots which went on for several days took place was because the kosovo people were disenfranchised from their own future were diplomatic negotiations about the future of kosovo going on then and the kosovo government let alone the kosovo people were not actually participating in those talks there was this whole fancy diplomatic system this negotiation process about the future of kosovo and the kosovars weren't part of it and funnily enough they were frustrated about that i'm colorblind i was born unable to see most colors this is why i wear gray and black most of the time and i have to take my wife with me to chose clothes and the only reason and life is not simple one reason narratives it was a complicated thing and i'm not pretending it was more simple than it was but that was one of the reasons and that kind of gave me the inspiration or rather to be precise it gave my wife the inspiration she said why don't you advise the kosovars why don't you advise their government on their diplomacy and the kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service they were not allowed diplomats they were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process which became known as the final status process of kosovo and so that was the idea that was the origin of the thing that became independent diplomat the world 's first diplomatic advisory group and a non profit to and it began when i flew back from london after my time at the u n in kosovo i flew back and had dinner with the kosovo prime minister and said to him that i come and advise you on the diplomacy i know this stuff it's what i do why don't i come and help you and he the multi party negotiation team of kosovo and kosovo became independent independent diplomat is now established in five diplomatic centers around the world and we're advising seven or eight different countries you heard it here first is going to be a new country within the next few years we're advising polisario front of the western sahara who are fighting to get their country back from moroccan occupation after thirty four years of dispossession we're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations which is suppose to culminate in copenhagen to be a fighter pilot when i was a boy i loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside and it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot and a bit of randomness here too because when i was beginning independent diplomat i went to a party in the house of lords which is a ridiculous place i was holding my drink like this and i bumped into this guy who was standing behind me and we started talking and he said i told him what i was doing and i rather grandly i was going to establish independent diplomat in new york at that time there was just me and me and my wife were moving back to new york and he said why don't you see my colleagues in new york and it turned out he worked for an innovation company called what if which some of you have probably heard of and one thing led to another and i ended up having a desk in what if in new york when i started independent diplomat and watching what if develop new flavors of chewing gum for wrigley or new flavors for coke actually helped me innovate new strategies for the and yet the word innovation doesn't exist in diplomacy it's all zero sum games and realpolitik and ancient institutions that have been there for generations and do things the same way they've always done things and independent diplomat today tries to incorporate some of the things i learned at what if we all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office we all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think and we use naive experts who may know nothing about the countries we're dealing with but may know something about something else to try to inject new thinking into the problems that we try to address for our clients it's not easy because our clients by definition are having a difficult time i did the tests in the royal air force to become a pilot and sure enough i failed i couldn't see all the blinking different lights and i can't distinguish color diplomatically there are i don't know some lessons from all of this personal and political and in a way they're the same thing the personal one off a cliff is actually a good thing and i recommend it and it's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump the second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today independent diplomat is part of a trend the world which is that the world is fragmenting states mean less than they used to and the power of the state is declining that means the power of others things is rising those other things are called non state actors they may be corporations they may be mafiosi they may be nice ngos they may anything any number of things we are living in a more complicated and fragmented world if governments are less able to affect the problems in the world who 's left to deal with it we have no choice but to embrace that reality what this means is it's no longer good enough to say that international relations or global affairs or chaos in somalia so i had to chose another career and this was in fact relatively easy for me because i had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood which was international relations as a child i read the newspaper what's going on in burma is none of your business and that you can leave it to governments to get on with i can connect any one of you by six degrees of separation to the al shabaab militia in somalia how later but if you eat fish interestingly enough but that connection is there we are all intimately connected and this isn't just tom friedman it's actually provable in case after case after case what that means is instead of asking your politicians to do things you have to look to yourself to do things,1,"my story is a little bit about war it's about disillusionment it's about death and it's about rediscovering idealism that wreckage and Pat's does a lesson about how to deal with a screwed-up fragmenting and dangerous world of the twenty-first century I don't believe in three food narratives I don't believe in a life history written decision I let consequence be that comes clean CDs need narratives that we presented with an encouraging each other I believe in Randomness and one of the reasons I believe that is because maybe becoming a diplomat was random I'm color-blind I was born unable to see most colors this is why I wear grey and black most of the time and I have to take my wife with me to let you choose clothes and. call it when I was a boy I loved watching planes Barrel over a holiday home in the countryside and it was my dream to be a fight at Paula and I did the text in the Royal Air Force to The Cosmopolitan sure enough I failed you, I couldn't see all the blinking different light so I can distinguish color so I had to choose another career and this was in fact relatively easy for me because I am passing all the way through my childhood which was international relations as a child I read the newspaper I was fascinated by the Cold War ins negotiations over intermediate-range nuclear missiles the proxy war between the Soviet Union and the US in Angola on these things really interested me and so I decided one day. Miami times when you said, you have to be very clever to be a diplomat and I entered the British Foreign Service that year 5000 people apply to become a diplomat and the twenty of us succeeded and as that suggests Elite and fascinating and exhilarating well being a diplomat then and now is it is an incredible job and I loved every minute of it I enjoyed the faces I bought myself a nice suit and leather soled shoes and reveled in this this this amazing access I had to travel to the Gaza Strip I headed the Middle East peace process section in the British foreign Ministry I became a speechwriter for the British foreign Secretary of fact I negotiated with diplomats. at the UN later I travel to Cabo and said they're not going to Stone off of The Fall of the Taliban and I would travel in a C-130 transport and Gavin visit Warlords in Mountain hideaways and negotiate with them about how we were going to eradicate all tied up from Afghanistan surrounded by my special forces have an escort of a platoon of Royal Marines cuz it was so dangerous and exciting that was fun it was really interesting and Incredibly Close community of people and the Pinnacle of my career that turned out 10 was with when I was posted to New York I'd already said in Germany No Way various other places but I was posted to YouTube on the UN Security Council for the British delegation of my responsibility was the Middle East which was my speciality and there I felt with things like the Middle East. process the Lockerbie issue we can talk about that later if you wish and rock to oblige it to self of these weapons I was the chief negotiator on this subject anyway might or it was kind of a very exciting time and it was very very dramatic diplomacy we went through several wars during my time in New York on a negotiated for my country the resolution in the security Council of the 12th of September 2001 condemning the attacks of the day before which will of course be present at the living in New York at the time. so it was kind of the best of times west of time kind of experience I live the high life I had to know I was very long as I live in a penthouse in Union Square I was a single British Diplomat in New York City you can imagine what that might have meant the end I decided I wasn't going to go back to the job waiting for me in London I decided to take a sabbatical in fact that the new school in calories in a particular way I realized that was something wrong with my work with me I was exhausted and I was disillusioned in a way I couldn't quite put my finger on it and I decided to take some time out from work the phone off this was very generous you could take these a special unpaid leave as they call them and yet remain. and eventually I decided to take us to come in to join the UN and talked about which was then under you and administration and two things happening caused by which kind of against as the randomness of life cuz these things turned out to be one of the two of the pivots of my life and helped deliver me to the next stage but they were random things one was that in the summer of 2004 the British government somewhat reluctantly decided to have an official inquiry into the use of Intelligence on wmd in the run-up to the Iraq War of a limited subject and I testified that inquiry in secret I had been steeped in the Intelligence on the Rock and his wmd and my testimony to the inquiry said three things that the government exaggerated the intelligence which was very clear in all the years I've read it and indeed our own internal assessment was that. Iraq wmd did not pose a threat to his neighbors like the third reason I won't guarantee but anyway I can get some money and that presented me with a crisis what was I going to do the test when he was deeply critical of my colleagues of my ministers to hide the mighty pups racing toward a falsehood and this wasn't a pretty thing I hesitated at first wife and eventually I decided to resign from the basic phone service I felt as a scene in the Al Pacino movie the inside of it she may know where he goes back to CVS off today let him down over the the tobacco guy and he was like that for me I love that movie. the smile on my face and do what I used to do gladly for them so I took a running leap and jump over the edge of a cliff and it was a very very uncomfortable unpleasant feeling and I started the food and today that fool hasn't stopped I'm still falling but in a way I've got used to the sensation of it and in a way I kind of like the sensation of it a lot better than I like that she's standing on top of the cliff wondering what to do I need a cup of water to give me. a second thing happening cost if I was trying to deliver the answer which I couldn't really also which is. what do I do with my life I love to play Missy I have no career my I expect my entire life to be different to be serving my country I wanted to be an ambassador to my mental with my heroes were able to go up to the top of my profession and here I was throwing it all away I had a lot of my friends were still in it my pension was in it and I gave it up and what was I going to do and that year because of the terrible terrible thing happened which I saw and mot 2004 that was terrible riots all over the province has it been more to talk about 18 people were killed it was Anna Kate and it's a very horrible thing to Sienna key to know that the police in the military that tomato treat staph actually install that rampaging mob he's coming down the street and the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street. Is when they decide to stop them when they've had enough burning and killing and I have. Kathy and I for it and I went through I went through those bulbs and with my Albanian friends we tried to stop it but we failed and that told me something and it's kind of a story but one of the reasons I tried to place those rights what's going on for several days to place was because the customer people with disenfranchised from the rain future that diplomatic negotiations about the future cost about going on then and the cost of a government and the people who actually participating in those tools that was his whole system is negotiation process about the cost of the future possible in the cost of one part of it and the manifestation of that frustration life is not simple one reason narratives it was a complicated. Bryson Roberts be precise to get my wife the inspiration she said why didn't you advise to advise the government on that diplomacy and the six habits that they will not allow the foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process which became known as the final phase of the process of Kosovo and so that was that was the origin of the thing that became independent Diplomat the world's first diplomatic Advisory Group I had a non-profit to boot and it began when I from London off to my time at the UN I put it back and had dinner with the cost of a prime minister and said to him look who I do I want to come and help you and he said raised his glass of Rocky to music just called, and I can't be comfortable and independent advising 36 on the multi-party negotiation team. I'll call Subaru in Kapolei became independent independent Diplomat is now established in five different expenses around the world and Advising seven or eight different countries or political groups depending how you wish to defend them and I'm not big on definitions were advising that Northern cypriots on how to reunify the real and we're driving the Burmese opposition the government of something to do and you had to hit foot is going to be a new country within the next few years we're advising the polisario front of the western Sahara who are fighting to get that country back from occupational to 34 years of dispossession we're devising various Island states in the climate change negotiations which is supposed to culminate in Copenhagen does a bit random this here too because when I was beginning independent Diplomat I went to park in the House of Lords which is ridiculous place but I was having out of my dream like this and I bumped into the sky behind me. started choking and he said I told him what I was doing and I told him and he said why why didn't you say my colleagues in the New York and Innovation company Coldwater and I ended up having a desk and what is when I started independent Diplomat and what can develop new flavors of chewing gum to Wrigley or new flavors for Coke actually help me innovate new strategies for the coffee bars and for the quarries in the western Sahara and I began to realize they were different ways of doing the Primacy the diplomacy like business is a business at solving problems and yet the word Innovation doesn't exist in diplomacy is over there are some games in real Paula take an ancient institutions that being that the generations in the deep do things the same way they will win. something an independent Diplomat today tries to incorporate some of the things I learned that was hit with each other across the office will work on the laptop we think we use that naive experts who may know nothing about the countries with dealing with but may know something about something else to try to inject in you thinking into the problems that we try to address for a client is not easy cuz our clients by definition of having a difficult time diplomatically personal and political the personal one is. falling off a cliff is actually a good thing and I recommended and it's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump the second thing is is a bigger lesson about the world today independent Diplomat is part of a trend which is emerging and evident across the world which is the lowest-ranked menting mean last one I used to the power of the state is declining that means the power of other things is rising those other things are cool known state taxes they may be cool creations that maybe makio see they may be nice and GI issues they may be anything any number of things we are living in a more complicated and fragmented will if governments are less able to affect the problems that affect us in the world then that means who is left to do with them who has to take greater responsibility to do with them. if I don't conduit has less to do with that we we have no choice but to embrace that reality what this means is is no longer good enough to say that international relations or Global Affairs or chaos in Somalia or what's going on in thumb is none of your business and then you can leave it to government to get home I can connect to any one of you by Six Degrees of Separation to the al-shabaab militia in Somalia ask me how late is the key if you eat fish interesting enough but that connection is there a well-connected missing just Tom Friedman is actually provable in case off the case off a case that means is instead of asking your politicians to do things you have to look to you as hell to do things an independent Diplomat has a kind of example of this and it sold at least when they're only example is but one example is it the way the world is changing is imported in what's going on at the place I used to work. Security Council the UN was established in 1945 is Charter is basically designed to stop conflicts between States interstate conflict today 80% of the agenda of the UN Security Council is about conflicts within States involving known State parties Gorillaz separatist Terrace if you want to call them at people who are not normal governments who are not normal space that is the fate of the world today when I realized this and when I look back on my time of the security Council and what happened with the cost of Oz and I realized often the people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the security Council actually invited to give their views of the security Council about this so I started off in a traditional mode. me and my colleagues independent Diplomat went round the UN Security Council we went round 17 you a member states the kazakhs Ethiopians we went to see them and said this is all wrong this is terrible that you don't consult these people actually affected you've got to tell them what you think would be great you can actually incorporate these people's views and see all the TV which means you'll decisions will be more effective and durable incredibly the security Council does its business in exactly the same way today that they did you know a x x number of years ago when I was 10 years ago. so we took we looked about the vacation of basically failure and for what can we do about something I thought if I'm going to spend the rest of my life love being for these, governments to do what needs to be done so what we're going to do is we're actually going to set up these meetings all cells so now independent Diplomat is in the process of setting up meetings between the UN Security Council and the parties to the dispute the door on the agenda the security Council so we will be bringing darfuri Rebel groups. the northern tip creates in the sub and cypriots Rebels from Akshay long laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world and we will be trying to bring the parties to New York to sit down in a quiet room in a private tattoo with no press and actually explain what they want to the members of the UN Security Council and put the members of the UN Security Council to explain to them what they want so there's actually a conversation which has never before happened and of course describing all this any of you who know politics with an incredibly difficult 90-degree with you the chances of failure I very high but. it certainly won't happen if we don't try to make it happen and my politics has changed fundamentally from when I was a diplomat to what I am today and I think the outputs is what Matt does not process technology find play some Bachata please technology to the twittering members of the around in demonstrations for now in political prison in Tehran where is yard remains in power technology has not delivered play to go change in the wrong you got to look at the output and you've got to say to yourself what can I do to produce that particular outfit that is the politics of the country and in a way in Independence, and bodies that fragmentation that change the is happening full of us. that's my story.Queen",0.6848958730697632,

89,CarolinePhillips_2010G.sph.wav,luckily all of this changed a couple of centuries later so one person could actually play and almost this is pretty heavy carry the hurdy gurdy the hurdy gurdy has been used historically through the centuries in mostly dance music because of the uniqueness of the melody combined with the acoustic boombox here and today the hurdy gurdy is used in all sorts of music traditional folk music dance contemporary and world music in the u k in france in spain and in italy and this kind of hurdy gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years it's made by specialized luthiers also in europe and it's very difficult to tune so to sing in basque which is the language spoken in the basque country where i live a region in france and spain this is tedglobal who can tell me what this is called in french i see you're all up on the history of hurdy gurdy vielle and in spanish zanfona and in italian ghironda okay hurdy gurdy or wheel fiddle so these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy gurdy the hurdy gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a crank to turn a wheel drone string which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe the second string is a melody string which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano and the third is pretty innovative it's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique it activates what's called the buzzing bridge or the dog i turn the crank and i apply pressure it makes a sound like a barking dog okay all of this is pretty innovative if you consider that the hurdy gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago and it took two people to play it one to turn the crank and another person yes to play the melody by physically pulling up large wooden pegs,1,now since this is Ted Global who can tell me what this is called in French. I see you're all up on the history of Hurdy Gurdy and in Spanish Symphonia and Italians you don't pay hurdy-gurdy or real fiddle. so these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy the hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a crank to turn a wheel to rub strings like the bow of a violin to produce music that has three different kinds of strings. the first string is the Drone string which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe. the second string is a Melody string which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano. and the third string is pretty Innovative it's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique it activates was called the buzzing Bridge or the dog. so when I turn the crank and I apply pressure. it makes it sound like a barking dog. okay so all of this is pretty Innovative if you consider. that the hurdy-gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago and it took two people to play at 1 to turn the crank and another person yes to play The Melody by physically pulling up large wooden pegs okay so luckily all of this changed a couple of centuries later so one person can actually play and almost pretty heavy carry the hurdy-gurdy the hurdy-gurdy has been used to store cleats through the centuries in mostly dance music because of the uniqueness of the melody combined with the acoustic Boombox here and today the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of Music a traditional folk music dance contemporary and World music in the UK in France and Spain and Italy. and just kind of Hurdy Gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years it's made by specialized luthiers also in Europe and it's very difficult to tune. so without further Ado would you like to hear it I didn't hear you what you like to hear it okay. cat like to sing in Basque which is the language spoken in The Basque country where I live in the region of France and Spain. go sit on the shorts.YouTube. play this is the song that you do and this is the song that kind of his has offended Celtic feel. the position of a watch is a function of its movement for lx420 to guarantee the position of a timepiece the pressing question was how to protect the movement itself the elements with the creation of the perfect match. a Rolex Oyster was born over the years I feel changes in the design continue to improve the oyster adding more Comfort while keeping the style contemporary along with more functions with the fastest show the dates for a small aperture on the face it was also the first wrist watch to spend the week info. in the early 1950s Rolex developed a professional watches whose functions went far beyond telling the time launched in 1953 the Submariner with the first Rolex watch guaranteed waterproof. already on an incredible journey of innovation and design decided to push the boundaries even further Maine history special with exploration letter launching in 1967. has a new direction from disc. it is with the painting and the Rolex deepsea safely descend to 12800 feet.

90,CarolynPorco_2007.sph.wav,and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that may be in the end the finest reward that we earn from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago and thank you very much now the saturn system is a rich planetary system it offers mystery scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach just studying the rings alone we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies and here 's a beautiful picture of the andromeda nebula which is our closest in the next eighteen minutes i'm going to take you on a journey and is really part of and is also a metaphor for a much larger human voyage to understand the inter connectiveness of everything around us and also how humans fit into that picture and it pains me that i can't tell you all that we have learned with cassini show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken in the last two and a half years because i simply don't have the time so i'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories that have emerged out of it's a journey that you and i have been on for many years now and it began some fifty years ago when humans first stepped off our planet and in those fifty years not only did we literally physically this major exploratory expedition that we are conducting around saturn and have been for the past two and a half years saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons they range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the us most of the beautiful pictures we've taken of saturn in fact show saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons here 's saturn with and then here 's saturn showing the rings edge on showing you just how vertically thin they are with the moon enceladus now two of the forty seven moons that saturn has are standouts and those are titan and enceladus titan is saturn 's largest moon and until cassini had arrived there was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain that we had remaining in our solar system and it is a body that has long intrigued people who 've watched the planets it has a very large thick atmosphere and in fact its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the earth or at least had in the past than any other body in the solar system its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen like you are breathing here in this room except that its atmosphere is suffused with simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane and these molecules high up in the atmosphere of titan get broken down and their products join together to make haze particles this haze is ubiquitous it's completely global and enveloping titan and that's why you cannot see down to the surface with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum but these haze particles it was surmised before we got there with cassini over billions and billions of years gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface in a thick organic sludge so like the equivalent the titan equivalent of tar or oil or what we didn't know what but this is what we suspected and these molecules especially methane and ethane can be it turns out that methane is to titan what water is to the earth it's a condensable in the atmosphere and so set foot on the moon but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets all eight of them and ok and above those clouds you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface the temperature at the surface is some three hundred and fifty degrees below zero fahrenheit but despite that cold you could have rain falling down on the surface of titan and doing on titan what rain does on the earth it carves gullies it forms rivers and cataracts it can create canyons it can pool in large basins and craters it can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills down into the lowlands so stop and think for a minute try to imagine what the surface of titan might look like it's dark high noon on titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the earth it's cold it's eerie it's misty it might be raining and you might be standing on the shores of lake michigan brimming with paint that is the view that we had of the surface of titan before we got there with cassini and i can tell you that what we have found on titan though it is not the same in detail is every bit as fascinating as that story is and for us it has been like for cassini people it has been like a jules verne adventure come true as i said it has a thick extensive atmosphere this is a picture of titan back lit by the sun with the rings as a beautiful backdrop and yet another moon there i don't even know which one it is it's a very extensive atmosphere we have instruments on cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere we have landed on asteroids we have rendezvoused with comets and at this point in time we have a spacecraft on its way to pluto the body formerly known as a planet and my camera system is one of them and we have taken pictures like this and what you see is bright and dark regions and that's about as far as it got for us it was so mystifying we couldn't make out what we were seeing on titan when you look closer at this region you start to see things like sinuous channels we didn't know you see a few round things this we later found out is in fact a crater but there's very few craters on the surface of titan meaning it's a very young surface and there are features that look tectonic they look like they've been pulled apart whenever you see anything linear on a planet it means there's been a fracture like a fault and so it's been tectonically altered but we couldn't make sense of our images until six months after we got into orbit an event occurred that many have regarded as the highlight of cassini's investigation of titan and that was the deployment of the huygens probe the european built huygens probe that cassini had carried for seven years across the solar system we deployed it to the atmosphere of titan it took two and a half hours to descend and it landed on the surface and i just want to emphasize how significant an event this is this is a device of human making and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history it is so significant that in my mind this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the us and europe and sadly that wasn't the case it was significant for another reason this is an international mission and this event was celebrated in europe in germany and the celebratory presentations were given in english accents and american accents and german accents and french and italian and dutch accents it was a moving demonstration of what the words united nations is supposed to mean a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good and in this case it was a massive undertaking and all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey a voyage to to explore a planet and to come to understand a planetary system that for all of human history had been unreachable and now humans had actually touched it so it was i mean i'm getting goose bumps just talking about it it was a tremendously emotional event and it's something that i will personally never forget and you probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down and it also took panoramic pictures and i can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of titan 's surface from the probe and this is what we saw and it was a shocker because it was everything we wanted those other pictures taken from orbit to be it was an unambiguous pattern a geological pattern it's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids and you can follow these channels and you can see how they all converge and they converge into this channel here which drains into this region you are looking at a shoreline was this a shoreline of fluids we didn't know but this is somewhat of a shoreline this picture is taken at sixteen kilometers this is the picture taken at eight kilometers ok again the shoreline okay now sixteen kilometers eight kilometers this is roughly understand something to get a sense of our cosmic place to understand something of our origins and how an airline altitude if you were going to take an airplane trip across the us you would be flying at these altitudes so this is the picture you would have at the window of titanian airlines as you fly across the surface of titan and then finally the probe came to rest on the surface and i'm going to show you ladies and gentlemen the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system and here is the horizon ok these are probably water ice pebbles yes and obviously it landed in one of these flat dark regions and it didn't sink out of sight so it wasn't fluid that we landed in what the probe came down in was basically the titan equivalent of a mud flat this is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane and it's probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of titan through these channels that we saw and has drained over billions of years to fill in low lying basins and that is what the huygens probe landed in but still there was no earth our planet and we living on it came to be and of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this in our images or even in the huygens images of any large open bodies of fluids where were they it got even more puzzling when we found dunes ok so this is our movie of the equatorial region of titan showing these dunes these are dunes that are one hundred meters tall this is the saharan desert of titan it's obviously a place which is very dry or you wouldn't get dunes so again it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid until finally we saw lakes in the polar regions and there is a lake scene in the south polar region of titan it's about the size of lake ontario and then only a week and a half ago we flew over the north pole of titan and found again we found feature here the size of the caspian sea so it seems that the liquids for some reason we don't understand or during at least this season are apparently at the poles of titan and i think you would agree that we have found titan is a remarkable mystical place it's exotic it's alien but yet strangely earth like and having earth like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the earth itself and so now we go onto enceladus is a small moon it's about a tenth the size of titan and you can see it here next to england just to show you the size this is not meant to be a threat and enceladus is very white it's very bright and its surface is obviously with fractures it is a very geologically active body but the motherlode of discoveries on was found at the south pole and we're looking at the south pole here where we found this system of fractures and they're a different color because they're a different composition they are coated and we have been to saturn before we visited saturn in the early nineteen eighties but our investigations of saturn these fractures are coated with organic materials moreover this whole entire region the south polar region has elevated temperatures it's the hottest place on the planet on the body that's as bizarre as finding that the antarctic on the earth is hotter than the tropics and then when we took additional pictures we discovered that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine icy particles extending hundreds of miles into space and when we color code this image to bring out the faint light levels we see that these jets feed a plume that in fact we see in other images goes thousands of miles into the space above enceladus my team and i have examined images like this and like this one and have thought about the other results from cassini and we have arrived at the conclusion that these jets may be erupting from pockets of liquid water under the surface of enceladus so we have possibly liquid water organic materials and excess heat in order words we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail have become far more in depth and detailed since the cassini spacecraft traveling across interplanetary space for seven years of modern day planetary exploration or in other words an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms and i don't think i need to tell you that the discovery of life elsewhere in our solar system whether it be on enceladus or elsewhere would have enormous cultural and scientific implications because if we could demonstrate genesis had occurred not once but twice independently in our solar system then that means by inference it has occurred a staggering number of times throughout the universe and its thirteen point seven billion year history right now earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life it is precious it is unique it is still so far the only home we've ever known and if any of you were alert and coherent during the nineteen sixties we'd forgive you if you a picture that no human eye has ever seen before it is a total eclipse of the sun seen from the other side of saturn and in this impossibly beautiful picture you see the main rings back lit by the sun you see the refracted image of the sun and you see this ring created in fact by the exhalations of enceladus but as if that weren't brilliant enough we can spot in this beautiful image sight of our own planet now there is something deeply moving about seeing ourselves from afar and capturing the sight of our little blue ocean planet in the skies of other worlds and that,1,in the next 18 minutes I'm going to take you on a journey and it's a journey that you and I have been on for many years now and it began some fifty years ago when humans first stepped off our planet and in those fifty years not only did we literally physically step foot step foot on the moon but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets all eight of them and we have landed on asteroids we have rendezvous. With comments and at this point in time we have a spacecraft in on its way to Pluto the body formerly known as a planet and all these robotic missions are part of a bigger human Journey a voyage to understand something to get a sense of our Cosmic place to understand something of our Origins and how Earth our planet and we living on it came to be and. all the places in the solar system that we might go to in search for answers to questions like this there's Saturn and we have been to Saturn before we have been Revisited Saturn in the early 1980s but our investigations of Saturn have become far more in-depth and details since the Cassini spacecraft traveling across interplanetary space for 7 years glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004 and became at that point the farthest robotic Outpost that yumanity had ever established around the Sun now the Saturn system is a rich planetary system that offers mystery scientific inside and obviously Splenda Beyond Compare and the investigation of this system has enormous Cosmic reach in fact just studying the Rings alone we stand to learn a lot about the disks of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies and here's a beautiful picture of the Android. the nebula which is our closest largest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and then here's a beautiful composite of the whirlpool Galaxy taken by the Hubble Space Telescope so the journey back to Saturn is really part of that is also a metaphor for a much larger human Voyage to understand the interconnectedness of everything around us and also how humans fit into that picture and it pains me that I can't tell you all that we have learned with Cassini and and all the Buick can show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken in the last two-and-a-half years cuz I simply don't have the time so I'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories that have emerged out of this major exploratory Expedition that we are conducting around Saturn and have been for the past two and a half years Saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons they range in size from a few kilometers across to his big across is the u.s.. civil beautiful pictures were taken of Saturn in fact show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons your Saturn with Downy and then here is Saturn showing the Rings at John showing you just how it vertically send they are with the moon Enceladus not to of the 47 moons that Saturn has are standouts and those are Titan and Enceladus Titan is Saturn's largest moon and until cuz he had arrived there was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain that we had remaining in our solar system. and it is a body that is long and treat people who watch the planets it's has a very large thick atmosphere and inspect its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the earth or at least had in the past than any of the body in the solar system its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen like you are breathing here in this room except that its atmosphere is suffused with simple organic materials like methane and Propane in Epping and these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan get broken down and their products join together to make Haze particles this Haze as ubiquitous as completely Global an enveloping Titan and that's why you cannot see down to the surface in the without fries and a visible region of the spectrum but these Haze particles it was to my chest before we got there with Cassini. over billions and billions of years gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface in a thick organic sludge so like the equivalent the Titan equivalent of tar or or or or what we didn't know why but this is what we suspected and these molecules especially methane and ethane can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan okay and so it turns out that methane is to tighten what water is to fear that it can it's a condensable in the atmosphere in so it's this recognizing the circumstance brought to the fore a whole world of his are possibilities you can have methane clouds okay and above those clouds you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface the temperature at the surface is some three hundred and fifty degrees below zero fahrenheit okay but despite that cold you can have a rain falling down on the surface of Titan and doing on Titan with rain.. are the carbs gullies his forms rivers and cataracts it can create Kenyans it can pool in large basins and craters okay it can wash this sludge off high mountain peak Sandhills down into the lower limbs so so stop and think for me to try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like okay it's dark high noon on Titan is as dark as deep Earth Twilight on the earth it's cold it's Eerie it's Misty it might be raining and you might be standing on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner okay that is the view that we had the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan that is not the same detail is every bit as fascinating as that story is and for us it is been like a kasini people it has been like a Jules Verne Adventure come true. as I said it has its extensive atmosphere this is a picture of Titan backlit by the sun with the Rings as a beautiful backdrop and a yet another Moon they aren't even know which one it is it's a very extensive atmosphere we have instruments on Cassini would concede down to the surface through this atmosphere and my camera system is one of them and we have taken pictures like this and what you see is bright and dark regions and that's about as far as it got for us it was so mystifying we couldn't make out what we were seeing on Titan when you look closer at this region you start to see things like send you a channels we didn't know you see a few round things this we have later found out is inspector crater but this very few craters on the surface of Titan meaning it's a very young surface and there are features that tectonic they look like they've been pulled apart whenever you see anything linear on a planet it means it has been a fracture okay like a fault and so this it's been tectonic Lee altered but we couldn't make sense of our. until six months after we got into orbit and event occurred that many regarded is the highlight of cassini's Investigation of Titan and that was the deployment of the Huygens probe the European built Huygens probe it ksenia carry for seven years across the solar system we deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan it just took two and a half hours to descend and it landed on the surface and I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is this is a device of human making and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history it is so significant that in my mind at this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the US and Europe and sadly that wasn't the case. it was significant for another reason this is an international Mission and this event was celebrated in Europe in Germany and the celebratory presentations were given in English accents an American accent and German accent and French and Italian and Dutch accents it was a moving demonstration of what the words United Nations are supposed to mean a true Union of Nations joined together in a colossal effort for good and in this case it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet and to come to understand the planetary system that for all of human history had been unreachable and now Youmans had actually touched it so I was I mean I'm getting Goose Bumps just talking about it it was a tremendously emotional event and it's something that I will personally never forget and you shouldn't either. but anyway the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down and it also took panoramic pictures and I can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of Titan surface from the probe and this is what we saw and it was a shocker because it was everything we wanted those other pictures taken from orbit to be it was an unambiguous pattern a geological pattern it's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids and you can follow these channels and you can see how they all converge and they converge into this channel here which drains into this region you're looking at a shoreline which is the shoreline of spell fluids we didn't know but this is somewhat of a shoreline this pictures taken at 16 km this is a picture taken at 8 km okay again the shoreline okay now 16 km 8 km this is roughly and Airline altitude if you want to take an airplane trip across the u.s. you would be flying at these altitudes so this is the picture you would have at the window. titanium Airlines as you fly across the surface of Titan and then finally the probe came to rest on the surface and I'm going to show you ladies and gentlemen the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system and here is the Horizon okay these are probably water ice Pebbles yes. and obviously it has landed in one of these Flat Dark regions and it didn't sink out of sight so it wasn't fluid that we landed in okay what the probe came down and was basically the Titan equivalent of a mudflat this is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane okay and is probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of Titan through these channels that we saw and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins and that is what Titan that is what the Huygens probe landed in but still there was no sign in our images or even in the Huygens images of any large open bodies of fluids where were they it got even more puzzling when we found doing okay so this is our movie of the equatorial region of Titan showing these Dunes okay these are doing is that are 100 meters tall separated by a few kilometres and they go on from miles and miles. miles is hundreds up to a thousand to twelve hundred miles of Dunes this is the Saharan Desert of Titan okay it's obviously a place with which is very dry or were you wouldn't get tunes so again it got puzzling that they were no bodies of fluids until finally we saw lights in the polar regions and there is a lake scene in the South polar region of Titan is about the size of Lake Ontario and then only a week and a half ago we Flew Over the North Pole is Titan and found again we found a feature hear the size of the Caspian Sea so it seems that the liquids for some reason we don't understand during at least this season are apparently at the poles of a Titan and I think you would agree that Titan we have found Titan is in a remarkable mystical place it's exotic at 2 alien but yet strangely Earth-like and having Earth-like geological formations and a. tremendous a geographical diversity and is a fascinating World whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the Earth itself and so now we go on to Enceladus Enceladus is a small moon is about the tents the size of Titan and you could see it here next to England just to show you the size this is not meant to be a threat okay and in some of this is very white is very bright and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures it is a very geologically active body but the mother lode of Discovery Zone and sell it was found at the South Pole and we're looking at the South Pole here where we found this system of fractures and they're a different color because they were different composition they are coded these fractures are coated with organic material more over this whole entire region okay the South polar region has elevated temperatures it's the hottest place on the planet on the phone the body that's as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on TV. is hotter than the tropics okay and then we took additional pictures we discovered that from these fractures are issuing Jets a fine I see particles expending hundreds of miles into space and when we color code this image to bring up the faint light levels we see that these Jets feed a plume that in fact we see another images goes thousands of miles into the space above and sell it as my team and I have examined images like this and like this one and have thought about the other results from Cassini and we have arrived at the conclusion that these Jets may they may be erupting from pockets of liquid water near under the surface of Enceladus so we have possibly liquid water organic materials and excess heat in other words we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail of modern-day Planetary Exploration or another words and environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms. I don't think I need to tell you that the discovery of life elsewhere in our solar system whether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere would have enormous cultural and scientific applications because if we could demonstrate that Genesis had occurred not once but twice independently in our solar system then that means by inference it has occurred a staggering number of times throughout the Universe and its 13.7 billion year history right now or Earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life it is precious it is unique it is still so far the only home he's ever known and if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s and we forgive you if you weren't okay you would remember this very famous picture taken by the Apollo 8 astronauts in 1968 it was the first time that Earth was image from space and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe and Ours. sense of responsibility for the protection of our own Planet while we on Cassini have taken an equivalent first that no a picture that no human has ever seen before it is a total eclipse of the song scene from the other side of Saturn and in this impossibly beautiful picture you see the main Rings backlit by the sun you see the refracted image of the Sun and you see this ring created in fact by the exhalations of Enceladus but as if that weren't really enough we can spot in this beautiful image site of our own Planet cradled in the arms of Saturn's rings. Now there is something deeply moving about seeing ourselves from afar and capturing the sight of our little blue ocean planet in the Skies over the world and that and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that maybe in the end the finest reward that we turn. from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago and thank you very much,0.8294270634651184,
91,CarolynPorco_2009U.sph.wav,flying closer and deeper into these jets into the denser regions of these jets so that now we have come away with some very precise compositional measurements and we have found that the organic compounds coming from this moon are in fact more complex than we previously reported while they're not amino acids we're now finding things like propane and benzene hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde and the tiny water crystals here now look for all the world like they are frozen droplets of salty water which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the jets come from so we are very encouraged by these results and we are much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this moon two years ago here at ted i reported that we had discovered at saturn with the cassini spacecraft an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small under the south pole an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms whether or not there are living organisms there of course is an entirely different matter and that will have to await the arrival back at when we might journey to the saturnine system and visit the enceladus interplanetary geyser park just because we can moon enceladus seen here this region seen here for the first time in the cassini image taken in two thousand and five this is the south polar region with the famous tiger stripe fractures crossing the south pole and seen just recently in late two thousand and eight here is that region again now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere is experiencing the onset of august and eventually winter and i also reported that we'd made this mind blowing discovery this once in a lifetime discovery of towering jets erupting from those fractures at the south pole and at that time two years ago i mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface but we weren't really sure however the implications of those results of a possible environment within this moon that could support prebiotic chemistry and perhaps life itself were so exciting that in the intervening two years we have focused more on enceladus we've flown the cassini spacecraft by this moon now several times,1,two years ago here at Ted a reported that we had discovered at Saturn with the Cassini spacecraft and anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small saturnia mood and sell it is seen here this region seen here for the first time in the Cassini image taken in 2005 this is the South polar region with the famous tiger stripe fractious crossing the South Pole and seemed just recently in late 2008 here is that region again now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere is experiencing the onset of August and eventually winter and I also reported that we'd made this mind-blowing discovery this once-in-a-lifetime discovery of towering Jets erupting from those fractions at the South consisting of tiny water ice crystals a company buy water vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane and at that time two years ago. I mentioned that we were speculating that these Jets might infect the geysers and erupting from Pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface but we weren't really sure however the implications of those results of a possible environment within this Moon that could support Prebiotic chemistry and perhaps life itself were so exciting that in the intervening 2 years we have focused more on Enceladus we've flown the Cassini spacecraft by this moon now several times flying closer and deeper into these Jets into the denser regions of his jet so that now we have Come Away with some very precise compositional measurements and we have found that the organic compounds coming from this moon are in fact more complex than we previously reported while they're not amino acids we're now finding things like propane and Benzene hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde and the tiny Water Crystals here now look for all the world like. Frozen droplets of salty water which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the Jets come from pockets of liquid water but that liquid water is in contact with Rock and that is a circumstance that could Supply the chemical energy in the chemical compound needed to sustain life so we are very encouraged by these results and we're much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this Moon Under the South Pole and environment through his own that is hospitable to living organisms whether or not they're all living organisms their course is an entirely different matter and that will have to await the arrival back at Enceladus of the spacecraft's hopefully sometime in the near future specifically equipped to address that particular question but in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day when we might Journey to the saturnian system and visit the Enceladus interplanetary. Geyser Park just because we can thank you,0.8515625,
92,CarolynSteel_2009G.sph.wav,and given that it takes three times as much grain actually ten times as much grain to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first that's not a very efficient way feeding us an it's an escalating problem too by two thousand and fifty it's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy rising hand in hand and that's going to pose an enormous problem six billion hungry carnivores to feed by that's a big problem and actually if we carry on as we are it's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to we're very hungry for fossil fuels too it takes about ten calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the west feed a city it's one of the great questions of our time yet it's one that's rarely asked we take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant and even though there is food that we are producing at great cost we don't actually value it half the food produced in the usa is currently thrown away even managing to feed the planet properly a billion of us are obese while a further billion none of it makes very much sense and when you think that eighty percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations it's a grim picture into cities the world is also embracing a western diet and if we look to the future it's an unsustainable diet so how did we get here and more importantly what are we going to do about it well to answer the slightly easier question first about ten thousand years ago i would say is the beginning of this process in the ancient near east known as the fertile crescent because as you can see it was crescent shaped and it was also fertile and it was here about ten thousand years ago that two extraordinary inventions agriculture and urbanism happened roughly in the same place and at the same time this is no accident because agriculture and cities are bound together they need each other and if we look at what those settlements were like we see they were compact they were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one that were in fact effectively spiritualized centralized food distribution centers because it was the temples that organized the harvest gathered in the grain offered it to the gods and then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people or indeed into this theater 's foyer in about an hour 's time there is going to be food there waiting for us having magically come from somewhere but when you think that every day for a city the size of london enough food has to if you like the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them and in fact that's true of every ancient city but of course not all of them were that small and famously rome had about a million citizens by the first century a d so how did a city like this feed itself answer is what i call ancient food miles basically rome had access to the sea which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away this is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world because it was very difficult to transport food over roads which were rough and the food obviously went off very quickly so rome effectively waged war on places like carthage and egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves in fact you could say that the expansion of the empire was really sort of one long drawn out militarized shopping spree have to mention this rome in fact at one stage i think that's extraordinary so rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite but the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre industrial world if we look at a map of london in the seventeenth century we can see that its grain which is coming in from the thames along the bottom of this map so the grain markets were to the south of the city and the roads leading up from them to cheapside which was the main market grain markets and if you look at the name of one of those streets bread street you can tell what was going on there three hundred years the same of course was true for fish fish was of course coming in by river as well same thing and of course billingsgate famously was london's fish market operating on site here until the mid nineteen eighties which is extraordinary really when you think about it this is another thing about food in cities once its roots into the city are established they very rarely move meat is a very different story because of course animals could walk into the city so much of london's meat was coming from the northwest from scotland and wales so it was coming in produced transported bought and sold cooked and arriving at the city at the northwest which is why smithfield london's very famous meat market was located up there poultry was coming in from east anglia and so on to the northeast i feel a bit like a weather woman and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes and then when they hit the eastern end of cheapside sold which is why it's called poultry and in fact if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age you can trace food coming in to it you can actually see how it was physically shaped by food both by reading the names of the streets which give you a lot of clues friday street in a previous life is where you went to buy your fish on a friday but also you have to imagine it full of food because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought earlier so this was obviously an organic city part of an organic cycle and that something similar has to happen every day for every city on earth it's remarkable that cities all of a sudden these animals are no longer walking into market they're being slaughtered out of sight and mind somewhere in the countryside and they're coming into the city by rail and this changes everything to start off with it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities really any size and shape in any place cities used to be constrained by geography they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means all of the sudden they are effectively emancipated from and as you can see from these maps of london in the ninety years after the trains came it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot and so on to a large splurge that would be very very difficult to feed with anybody on foot either animals or people and of course that was just the beginning after the trains came cars and really this marks the end of this process it's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all and this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell devoid of mess certainly devoid of people because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape in fact what they did to get food was they got in their cars we live in places like this as if they're the most natural things in the world forgetting that because we're animals and that we need to eat we're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient to a box somewhere on the outskirts came back with a week 's worth of shopping and wondered what on earth to do with it and this really is the moment when our relationship both with food and cities changes completely here we have food that used to be the center the social core of the city at the periphery it used to be a social event buying and selling food now it's anonymous we used to cook now we just add water a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something we don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat we just read the back of a label on a packet and we don't value food we don't trust it so instead of trusting it we fear it and instead of valuing it we throw it away one of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they've made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder by making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place they've actually distanced us from our most important relationship which is that of us and nature it's not a new question five hundred years ago it's what thomas more was asking himself this is the frontispiece of his book utopia and it was a series of semi independent city states if that sounds remotely familiar a day 's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming and grew vegetables in their back gardens and ate communal meals together and so on and i think you could argue that food is a fundamental it even got built but nothing to do with this vision that howard had and that is the problem with these utopian ideas that they are utopian utopia was actually a word that thomas moore used deliberately it was a kind of got a double derivation from the greek it can either mean a good place or no place because it's an ideal it's an imaginary thing we can't have it and i think as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling were and as more of us move into cities more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me it's soybean fields in mata grosso in brazil in that makes it not much use so i've come up with an alternative which is sitopia from the ancient greek sitos for food and topos for place i believe we already live in sitopia we live in a world shaped by food and if we realize that we can use food as a really powerful tool a conceptual tool design tool to shape the world differently so if we were to do that what might sitopia look like i think it looks a bit like this i have to use this slide it's just the look on the face of the dog but anyway this is it's food at the center of life at the center of family life being celebrated being enjoyed people taking time for it this is where food should be in our society but you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this by the way these can be men as well of the social life of the city because without that you can't have this kind of place food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape and is not just a and this is a community project i visited recently in toronto it's a greenhouse where kids get told all about food and growing their own food here is a plant called kevin or maybe it's so sitopia for me is really way of seeing it's basically recognizing that sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere the trick is to join them up to use food as a way of and if we do that we're going to stop seeing cities as big metropolitan unproductive blobs like this we're going to see them more like this as part of the these are extraordinary landscapes but few of us ever get to see them and increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding which is why i think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing it's a reconceptualization of the way food shapes our the best image i know of this is from six hundred and fifty years ago it's ambrogio lorenzetti 's allegory of good government it's about the relationship between the city and the and i think the message of this is very clear if the city looks after the country the country will look after the city and i want us to ask now what would ambrogio lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today what would an allegory of good government look like today i think it's an urgent question it's one we have to ask and we have to start answering we know we are what we eat we need to realize that the world is also what we eat but if we take that idea we can use food as a really powerful tool to shape the world better thank you very much as more of us move into cities more of us are eating meat so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals,1,"how do you feed a fishing. it's one of the great questions of all time yet it's one that's ready oft we take it to Grand said that if we going to show through restaurant or indeed into this theater so in about an hour's time is going to be seized by waiting for us having magic he come from somewhere but when you think this every day for sissy the size of lungs and enough food has to be produced transposes potion Souls cooked Ethan disposed of and that something similar has to happen every day for every since you all know it's remarkable that says he's got fat ass who. we live in places like this is a test of the most natural things in the world suggesting that because we're animals and that we need to eat where I actually asked the pens until now but not sure what is our ancient ancestors were more of us move into cities more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary Landscapes like the one behind me is soybean field in my side roster in Brazil in order to feed us. these are extraordinary Landscapes that she was going to get to see them and increasingly these Landscapes and not just feeding us either. there's more of us move into this he's more of a Siri sing me who the fudge is it and he will bring from globally now got fed the animals rather than to ask even animals and given that it takes three times as much grain as the ten times as much grain to feed a human if it's cost you an animal that's not a very efficient way with feeding us. and it's an escalating problem to buy 2015 is estimated that twice the number of us against be living in Sissy's and it's also estimated that is going to be twice as much Mason diary consumed say Neeson's oven is in the rising hunting high and I'm not staying to pose an enormous problem 6 billion hungry carnivals to fees buy 2015. that's a big problem actually if we carry on as we are it's a problem is very unlikely to be able to sold 19 million hectares of rainforest the lost every year to create new arable land over at the same time as using an equivalent amount existing are both without analyzation in a rotation. I was very hungry for food fuels to you takes about 10 calories for 270 calories food we consume in the West. and even though this field that when producing at Great cost we think I actually value is off the food produced in the USA is currently throwing away and has to end all of this the end of this long for his tattoo not even managing to feed the planet for playing a billion of us ever be swell as far as a billion starve. none of it makes very much sense when you think that AC percentage of global trade in food and I was controlled by just five multinational corporations it's a grim picture is when moving into Sissy's the world is also embracing and Western donors and if we look to the Future it's an unsustainable done it so how did we get here and more importantly we going to do about this easier question for about ten thousand years ago I was a Christian because you can see it was crescent-shaped and it was also the first time and it was here about ten thousand years ago the two extraordinary inventions I can coach her and then isn't happened roughly in the same place at the same time this is no accident because I'd be call Extreme Sissy's a bound together they need each other because it was discovery of. ancient ancestors for the first time but used to food source that was not enough and stable enough to support common in the South Romans. if we look at what those documents would like to see they become times they were surrounded by productive farmland and dominated by large Temple complex is like this one is are the effects of these spiritualize Central City distribution centers because it was the 10th hole that organized the Harvest gathered in the grain offered it to the girls and then offered the grain that the girls didn't he talk to the people so if you'd like the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the Grain and the Harvest that sustains them. and in fact that true of every ancient sissy but a pulled muscle under him without Smule a famously room had about 2 million citizens by the first entry IDs and how did the city like this feed itself. you don't suppose with my crew ancient Seed Miles basically room how to access to the Sea which made it possible for it to import food from very long way away this is the only way it was possible to do this in the world is very difficult to transfer see David Rhodes which from Ralph attitude oversee went off very quickly and effectively waged war on places like coffee and Egypt just to get it pulled on the grain reserves and in fact you could say that the expansion of the empire was ready to do one long drawn-out militarized shopping spree really I love to thanks I just have to mention this but really been trying to see you soon. Is from lungs and it won't say nothing at 6 and 3.. but the interesting thing is the other things that happened in the pre-industrial wild we look at a map of London in the 17th century we can see that it's grain which is coming in from the tens along the Boston with this not the grain markets which is a sign for the Sissy and then the roads leading out from them to cheapside which was the main Market what is a grain markets and if you look at the name of one of those trees fresh treats you can tell what was going on that three hundred years ago in the same across the street for fish fish with the school's coming in by river as well same thing and apples billingsgate famously was Johnson's Fish Market operating on site here until the mid-1980s with his extraordinary ready when you think about everybody else was wandering around with movable fins and bricks and then the fish happening so down on the pools this is another thing about food and Sissy's wants its roots into the 50-year established they very rarely move meat is a very different story. those animals could walk into the sissy so much of London's meet with coming from the Northwest from Scotland and Wales that is coming in and arriving at the CC out the Northwest which is why Smithfield lungs and his face famous Meat Market was okay so don't buy poetry was coming in for me signs of you and so on to the Northeast feet protracted little turn the shoes and then when they hit the Eastern end of cheats on his that's why they was Souls which is what foods poultry and in front of any sissy built before the Industrial Age you can trace food coming into that you can actually see how is physics he shakes buy food close by reading the names of the streets to use the Friday streets on a previous life is why you went to buy a fish on a Friday but I will say you have to mention it full of food because the streets in the public spaces for the only places where food was born. Smithfield in 1830 you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of why your food came from different if you were having fun day long at the challenge is where it was moving or breathing outside your window about three days earlier so this was obviously an organic organic find home. and then Ten Years Later everything changed this is an image of the Great Western in 1814 as you can see some of the earliest train passengers pigs and she say all the songs in the movie no longer walking into my pockets that being floated as a size in mind somewhere in the countryside and I coming into the sissy by rental and this changes everything. it's all good it makes it possible for the first time scrow city is really any size and shape in any place that has used to be constrained by geography they used to have to get that food was very difficult physical means or the side effects of the Emancipation and you can see from these knots of London in the 90 is all for the trains came it goes from being a little blogs it was quite easy to feed the animals coming in on 5th in the salon to Lord's blood that it was very very difficult to fees with anybody on first or the animals on people. and who's that was just the beginning of the train can cause and believe it ends of this process it's the final amount the patient of Assisi from any apparent relationship with nature of the conversation is devoid of smell the void of mess with people who would have dreamt of walking inside what they did to get food was they cost and that caused drive to park somewhere on the outskirts came back with a week's worth of something and wanted was enough to do with that and this really is the moment when our relationship with his changes complete here we have food that used to be the sense of the social core of the 50 at the periphery it used to be a social event volume setting food now it's Anonymous we used to cook now we just add an egg. current value for use we didn't trust it so instead of trusting it be Ferris and inside is not even his we throw this away. one of the great ironies of Multan phase systems is that they've made the very thing they promised to make easy of not called by making it possible to build cities anywhere in any place they don't sleep distances from a most important relationship which is I-70 and nature and pool say they've made of dependent on system that any they can deliver that as we seeing around sustainable and what are we going to do about that. it's nothing you question five hundred years ago. It's worse Thomas movies of seeing himself this is the front of piece of his book Utopia and it was a series of semi independent city-state about sounds from a day's walk from one another while everyone was basically falling my eyes as green vegetables and about goblins and a communal meals together and say well and I think you could argue that food at the fundamental principle of Utopia even then we'll never find it that way and here's another very famous you say to Envision That 70's how is it called and Sissy same idea as serious as semi-independent city-states little Globes of Metropolitan stuff with arable land around Jones one another by Railway and again Foose could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision and has nothing to do with this Vision that how it had a night of the problem with these utopian ideas that they are utopian Utopia was actually was it Thomas More you deliberately. please go to double derivation from the Greek it can add them in the good place on new place because it's the ideal it's an imaginary thing we have its and I think it's a conceptual thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling that makes it not much use so I've come up with an alternative from the ancient Greeks what's the place I believe we already live in society we live in well shaped buy food that if we realize that we can use for you is really powerful tool conceptual tools are going to to shape the world differently to do that might to take looks like. but I think it looks a bit like this I have to look on the face of the dog this is. it's food at the Centre of Life at the Center for Family Life being celebrated being enjoyed people taking time for it this is what food should be in our society but you can't have things like this unless you have people like this by the way these can be mad as well it's people who think about these he think I had actually recognize them we need these people that possible because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this here I deliberately chose this cuz it is a man behind vegetable markets were clipped, his friendship part of the social life of the 50. because without that you can't have this kind of place food that's friendly clean Lucid talk to the Landscaping is not just to there is some commodity off in some unseen how whole counter The View semen cause of homelessness is supposed to be bringing the whole thing together. this is a community project I visited recently in Tromso at the greenhouse by kids got holes all about food and bring the rain food his Uncle Kevin or maybe it's a longing for kids cool Kevin I don't know but anyway these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect his nature is extremely important. foods to try to piss me is when your way of seeing it's basically recognizing that zootopia already exists in little pockets everyone the trick is to join them off to use food as well as seeing if we do that we going to stop seeing Sissy's is Big Metropolitan unproductive Globes like this we going to see the more like this is Tasha's be productive organic framework of which they are never to be apart symbiotic reconnected. Because we need not to be pretty since he's not this anymore we need to be thinking more about, couch which is why I think this image of sums up to me to kind of thinking we need to be doing it's a reconceptualization of the way through shapes Our Lives the best image I know if this is from 650 years ago at sunbridge a good government is about the relationship between the city and the countryside and I think the message of this is right there at the city looks off to the country the country will look off to the 15. and I want us to us now what would a j Lawrence sassy pants if he painted this image today what would an allegory of good government look like today cuz I think it's an urgent question is when we have to ask and we have two cell phones ring we know who we are what we eat we need to realize that the world is will say what we eat but if we take that's my debit can use food as a really powerful tool to shape the world faster thank you very much.traffic is a global epidemic traffic is creating 45% of the world's pollution in the UK time wasted in traffic cost 20 billion a year would you place a clean around the Falls to commute Stockholm put it to a vote vote vote is for it. how to do something install come to improve the environment and to get the better of a flow in the traffic will put a price on taking your car into the center Paso stock on a cold that congestion charges. if you start the system like this and it doesn't work on the first day then you will be in big trouble if not the perfect from Davon. there are 18 M tickets to the city each is equipped with cameras pictures of taking out the rear and front license plates these pictures are sent to Central system that identifies the license plates and make sure that the right person pays for the right passages of the license plate we went out IBM's Global organization and the R&D centres and find a very good software we could use a weight management demanded in two months time going to 9% of old pictures are correct identified.

I'm over the past 12 years and we maintain that put that together as a project to really start the universe across all scales. what we see here are satellites around the Earth and the Earth improper registration against the universe as we see. NASA supported this work 12 years ago. as part of the rebuilding of the Hayden planetarium so that we would share this with the world the Digital Universe is the basis of our space show Productions that we do our main space shows in the dome. but what you see here is the result of actually internships at we hosted with Lynn shipping University in Sweden. and I've had 12 students work on this for their graduate work and the result has been this software called you any of you and a company called skips and Sweden. this software allows interactive use and so this actual flight path in movie that we see here was actually flown live capture this live from my laptop in a cafe called Earth matters on the Lower East Side of Manhattan where I live and it was done as a collaborative project. with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art Exhibit on comparative cosmology. and so as we move out we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of galaxies since we see here light travel time giving you a sense of how far away we are. as we move out. the light from these distant galaxies of taking so long we're essentially backing up into the past. we back so far up we're finally seeing a containment around us the Afterglow of the Big Bang this is the W map microwave background that we see a fly outside it here just to see the sort of containment if we were outside this almost be meaningless in the senses before time but this is our containment of the visible Universe we know the universe is bigger than that which we can see coming back quickly we see here the radio spear that we jumped out of in the beginning but these are positions latest positions of exoplanets that we've mapped and our son here obviously with our own solar system. if you're going to see we're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down to our resume the solar system these are the pads Voyager 1 Voyager 2 Pioneer 11 and Pioneer 10 the first 4 spacecraft to have left the solar system. coming in closer. picking up first. orbit of the moon and we see the Earth. this map can be updated and we can add a new data I know dr. Carolyn Porco Z camera pi4 the Cassini Mission but here we see the complex trajectory of the Cassini Mission color coded for different Mission phases ingeniously developed so that 45 encounters with the largest moon Titan which is larger than the planet Mercury diverts the orbit into different parts of mission face. the software allows us to come close and look at parts of this the software can also be Network between domes we have a growing user base of this when we Network down when we can Network between domes and classrooms were actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub-Saharan planetarium in Ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in Columbia and a high school in Cambodia and the Cambodian serve actually control the Hayden planetarium from their High School. this is an image from Saturday photographed by the aqua satellite but through the interview software and so you're seeing the edge of the Earth this is Nepal this is in fact of Lhasa. right here in Tibet but we can see the haze from fires and so forth in the Ganges Valley Down Below in India this is Nepal and Tibet. and just in closing. quick to say this beautiful world that we live on here we see. bit of the snow that some of you may have had to Brave and coming out. so I'd like to just say that what the world needs now is is a sense of being able to look at our self and it's much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is because our home is the universe and we are the universe essentially we carry that in us and to be able to see our contacts in this larger sense at all scale helps us all I think and understanding where we are and who we are in the universe thank you.investment in Broadband high-speed internet can help small businesses create new American jobs small businesses are being formed dreams are being launched and it AT&T we're investing billions to upgrade and build out our wired and wireless networks now is not the time to stall momentum or stifle Innovation or investment jobs dreams and the future are at stake AT&T do our world delivered,0.7630208730697632,
94,CaryFowler_2009G.sph.wav,you see apples that are red yellow and green and that's about it so let me show you a picture of one form of diversity here 's some beans and are about thirty five or forty different varieties of beans on this picture now imagine each one of these varieties as being distinct from another about the same way as a poodle as a great dane if i wanted to show you a picture of all the dog breeds in the world and i put thirty or forty of them on a slide it would take about ten slides because there about four hundred breeds of dogs in the world but there are thirty five to forty thousand different varieties of beans so if i were to going to show you all the beans in the world and i had a slide like this and i switched it every second it would take up my entire ted talk and i wouldn't have to say anything i've been fascinated with crop diversity for about thirty five years from now ever since i stumbled across a fairly obscure academic article by a guy named jack harlan but the interesting thing is that this diversity and the tragic thing is that this diversity is being lost we have about two hundred thousand different varieties of wheat and we have about two to four hundred thousand different varieties of rice but it's being lost and i want to give you an example of that it's a bit of a personal example in fact in the united states in the eighteen hundreds that's where we have the best farmers and gardeners were growing seven thousand one hundred named varieties of apples imagine that seven thousand one hundred apples with names today six thousand eight hundred of those are extinct no longer to be seen again and at the end of the speech i would ask how many people have found a name and i never had fewer than two thirds of an audience hold up their hand and i said you know what these apples come from your ancestors and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them they gave them their name the bad news is they're extinct the good news is a third of you didn't hold up your hand your apple 's still out there find it make sure it doesn't join the list so i want to tell you that the piece of the good news is that the fowler apple is still out there and he described the diversity within crops all the different kinds of wheat and rice and such as a genetic resource the fowler apple is described in here i hope this doesn't surprise you as a beautiful i don't know if we named the apple of or the apple named us to be honest the description goes on and it says that it doesn 't rank high in quality however and then he has to go even further it sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of as grown in new york the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size and quality and is on the whole and i guess there's a lesson to be learned here and the lesson is so why save it i get this question all the time why don't we just save the best one and there are a couple of answers to that question one thing is that there is no such thing as a best one today 's best variety is tomorrow 's lunch for insects or pests or disease and he said this genetic resource and i'll never forget the words stands between us and catastrophic starvation on a scale we cannot imagine the other thing is that maybe that fowler apple or maybe a variety of wheat that's not economical right now has disease or pest resistance or some quality that we're going to need for climate change that the others don 't so it's not necessary why as a raw material as a trait we can use in the future think of diversity as options and options of course are exactly what we need an era of climate change and university of washington to ask the question what's going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change and what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops to be able to adapt to this in short the answer is that in the future in many countries the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter than anything those crops have seen in the past the coldest growing seasons of the future hotter than the hottest of the past agriculture adapted to that i don't know can fish play the piano if agriculture hasn't experienced that how could it be adapted now the highest concentration of poor and hungry people in the world and the place where climate change ironically is going to be the worst is in south asia and sub sahara africa so i've picked two examples here and i want to show you i figured he was really on to something or he was one of these academic nutcases so i looked a little further and what i figured out was that he wasn't a nutcase he was the most respected scientist in the field in the histogram before you now the blue bars represent the historical range of temperatures going back far as we have temperature data and you can see that there's some difference between one growing season and another some are colder some are hotter and it's a bell shaped curve the tallest bar is the average temperature for the most number of growing seasons in the future later this century it's going totally out of bounds the agricultural system and more importantly the crops in the field in india have never experienced this before thirty if the maize or corn varieties which is the dominant crop fifty percent of the in southern africa are still in the field thirty percent decrease of production in the context of increasing population that's a food crises it's global in nature we will watch children starve to death on tv now you may say that twenty years is a long way off it's two breeding cycles for maize we have two rolls of the dice to get this right we have to get climate ready crops in the field and we have to do that rather quickly now the good news is that we have conserved we have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity agricultural diversity mostly in the form of seed and we put it in seed banks which is a fancy way of saying a freezer if you want to conserve seed for a long term and you want to make it available to plant breeders and researchers you dry it and then you freeze in rwanda in the solomon islands and then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures and all kinds of things and every time something like this happens what he understood was that biological diversity crop diversity is the biological foundation of agriculture it means extinction we lose diversity and i'm not talking about losing diversity in the same way that you lose your car keys i'm talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs actually losing it never to be seen again so a number of us got together and decided that you know enough is enough and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility that can really offer protection for our biological diversity maybe not the most charismatic diversity you don't look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do a panda bear but it's very important diversity so we needed a really safe place and we went quite far north to find it to svalbard in fact this is above mainland norway you can see greenland there that's at seventy eight degrees north it's as far as you can fly on a regularly scheduled airplane it's a remarkably beautiful landscape i can't even begin to describe it to you it's otherworldly beautiful we worked with the norwegian government and with which is built in a mountain in svalbard the idea of svalbard was that it's cold so we get natural freezing temperatures it's remote it's remote and accessible so it's safe and we don't depend on mechanical refrigeration this is more than just an artist 's dream it's now a reality it's the raw material the stuff of evolution in our agricultural crops not a trivial matter and this next picture shows it in context in svalbard and here 's the front door of this facility when you open up the front door this is what you're looking at it's pretty simple it's a hole in the ground it's a tunnel and you go into the tunnel chiseled in solid rock about one hundred and thirty meters there are now a couple of security doors so you won 't see it quite like this again when you get to the back you get into an area that's really my favorite why is that i think of it as sort of a cathedral and i know that this tags me as a bit of a nerd but some the happiest days of my life have been spent if you were to walk into one of these rooms you would see this it's not very exciting but if you know what's there it's pretty emotional and he also understood that that foundation was crumbling literally crumbling that indeed a mass extinction was underway we have now about four hundred and twenty five thousand samples of unique crop varieties there's seventy thousand samples of different varieties of rice in this facility right now about a year from now we'll have over half a million samples we're going up to over a million and someday we'll basically have samples about five hundred seeds of every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state in this facility this is a backup system for world agriculture it's a backup system for all the seed banks storage is free it operates like a safety deposit box norway owns the mountain and the facility but the this particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the united states of canada and an international institution from syria i think it's interesting in that this facility i think is almost the only thing i can think of these days where countries literally every country in the world because we have seeds from every country in the world all the countries of the world have gotten together to do something that's both long term the water crisis agriculture takes seventy percent of fresh water supplies on earth i can't look you in the eyes and tell you that there is such a solution for those things or the energy crisis or world hunger in our fields in our agricultural system and that this mass extinction was taking place with very few people noticing and even fewer caring or peace in conflict i can't i look you in the eyes and tell you that i have a simple solution for that but i can look you in the and tell you that we can't solve any of those problems if we don't have crop diversity because i challenge you to think of an effective efficient sustainable solution to climate change if we don't have crop diversity because quite literally if agriculture doesn't adapt to climate change neither will we and if crops don't adapt to climate change neither will agriculture neither will we so this is not something pretty and nice to do there are a lot of people who would love to have this diversity exist just for the existence value of it it is i agree a nice thing to do but it's a necessary thing to do so in a very really sense i believe we as an international community should get organized to complete the task the svalbard global seed vault is a wonderful gift that norway and others have given us but it's not the complete answer we need to collect the remaining diversity that's out there we need to put it into good seed banks that can offer those seeds to researchers in the future we need to catalog it it's a library of life but right now i would say we don't have a card catalog for it and we need to support it financially my big idea would be that while we think of it as commonplace to endow an art museum or endow a chair at a university we really ought to be thinking about endowing wheat thirty million dollars in an endowment would take care of preserving all the diversity in wheat forever so we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms and my final thought is that we of course by conserving wheat rice potatoes and the other crops we may quite simply end up saving ourselves thank you now i know that many of you don't stop to think about diversity in agricultural systems and let 's face it that's logical you don't see it in the newspaper every day and when you go into the supermarket you certainly don't see a lot of choices there,1,"I've been fascinated with with crop diversity for about 35 years from now ever since I've stumbled across a fairly obscure academic article by a guy named Jack Harlan and he described the diversity within crops all the different kinds of Wheat and rice and such as a Genetic Resource and he said this Genetic Resource and I'll never forget the word stands between us and catastrophic starvation on a scale we cannot imagine. I figured he was either really onto something or he was one of these academic not cases so I looked a little further and what I figured out was that he wasn't in that case he was the most respected scientist in the field. what do you understood was that biological diversity crop diversity is the biological Foundation of agriculture. it's the raw material the stuff of evolution in our agricultural crops not a trivial matter. and he also understood that that Foundation was crumbling literally crumbling. that indeed a mass extinction was underway in our in our fields in our agricultural system and did this mass extinction was taking place with very few people noticing and even fewer caring. now I know that many of you don't stop to think about diversity and agricultural systems and let's face it that's that's logical you don't see it in the newspaper every day and when you go into the supermarket you certainly don't see a lot of choices there you see apples that are red yellow and green and that's that's about it so let me show you a picture of one form of diversity here's some beans and. they're about 35 or 40 different varieties of beans on this picture now imagine each one of these varieties as being distinct from another about the same way as a poop from great dane if I wanted to have them show you a picture of all the dog breeds in the world and I put 30 or 40 of them on a slide it would take about 10 slides because they're about 400 breeds of dogs in the world but they're about 35 to 40,000 different varieties of beans so if I were going to show you all the beans in the world and I had a slide like this and I switched it every second it would take up my entire Ted Talk and I wouldn't have to say anything.but the interesting thing is that this diversity in the tragic thing is that this diversity is being lost we have about two hundred thousand different varieties of Wheat and we have about two to four hundred thousand different varieties of rice but it's being lost and I want to give you an example of that it's a bit of a personal example in fact in the United States in the 1800s that's where we have the best data farmers and gardeners were growing 7100 named varieties of apples imagine 7100 apples with names. today 6800 of those are extinct. no longer to be seen again I used to have a list of these extinct apples and when I would go out and give a presentation I would pass the list out in the audience I wouldn't tell him what it was but it was an alphabetical order and I would tell them to look for they are their names their family names their mother's maiden name and at the end of the speech I would ask how many people have found a name and I never had fewer than two-thirds of an audience hold up their hand and I said you know what. these apples come from your ancestors and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could get them they gave them their name. the bad news is they're extinct. the good news is a third of you didn't hold up your hand. your Apple still out there find it make sure it doesn't join the list. I want to tell you that piece of the good news is that the Fowler apple is still out there. and there's an old book back here and I want to read a piece from it. book was published in 1904 called the apples of New York and this is the second volume you see we used to have a lot of apples and the Fowler apple is described in here. I hope this doesn't surprise you as a beautiful fruit. I don't know if we named the Apple the Apple named us but the. but. to be honest the description goes on and it says it it doesn't rank high in quality however and then he has to go even further it sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine has grown in New York the fruit usually failed to develop properly and size and quality and is on the whole unsatisfactory. and I guess there's a lesson to be learned here and the lesson is so why save it I get this question all the time why don't we just save the best one. and their couple answers that question one thing is that the best there is no such thing as a best one today's best variety is tomorrow's lunch for an insect or Pastor disease. the other thing is that maybe that Fowler apple or maybe a variety of queef it's not economical right now has disease or test resistance or some quality that we're going to need for climate change but the others don't so it's not necessary thank God that the Fowler apple is the best apple in the world it's just necessary or interesting that it might have one good unique trait and for that reason we oughta be saving it why is a raw material as as a trait that we can use in the future think of diversity as. a that's giving his options and. options of course are exactly what we need in an era of climate change I'll show you I want to show you two slides but first I want to tell you that we've been working at the global crop diversity trust with the number of Sciences between Stanford and University of Washington to ask the question what's going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change and what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops to be able to adapt to this. in short the answer is it in the future in many countries the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter than anything those crops have seen in the past the coldest growing season is a future hotter than the hottest of the past is agriculture adapted to that I don't know can fish play the piano if they have it if agriculture has an experience that how could it be adapted now the highest concentration of poor and hungry people in the world and the place where climate-change ironically is going to be the worst is in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa subject two examples here and I want to show you in the histogram before you now the blue bars represent the historical range of temperatures going back is about as far as we have temperature data and you can see that there's some difference between one growing season another summer cold or summer hotter and it's a bell-shaped curve the tallest bar there is the average temperature for the most. growing seasons in the future later this Century it's going to look like the red totally out of bounds the agricultural system and more importantly the crops in the field in India have never experienced this before. here's South Africa the same story but the most interesting thing about South Africa is we don't have to wait for 2017 for there to be trouble by 2030 if the Maize or corn varieties which is the dominant crop 50% Rishon in southern Africa are still in the field in 2030 will have a 30% decrease in production of May's because of the climate change already in 20-30 30% decrease in production in the context of increasing population that's a food crisis its Global in nature we will watch children starve to death on TV. now you may say that 3020 years is a long way off its two breeding cycles for Maze We have to roll the dice to get this right we have to get climate ready crops in the field and we have to do that rather quickly now the good news is that we have conserved we have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity agricultural diversity mostly in the form of seed and we put it in seed banks which is a fancy way of saying a freezer if you want to conserve seed for a long-term and you want to make it available to plant breeders and researchers you dry it and then you freeze it. unfortunately these seed banks are located around the world and buildings and their vulnerable and disasters have happened in recent years we lost the gene Bank the seed bank in the Iraq and Afghanistan you can guess why in Rwanda in the Solomon Islands and then they're just daily disasters that take place in these buildings financial problems and mismanagement and Equipment failures and all kinds of things and every time something like this happens it means Extinction we lose diversity and I'm not in the same way that you lose your car keys I'm talking about losing it and same way that we lost the dinosaurs actually losing it never to be seen again so a number of us got together and decided to you know enough is enough and we need to do something about that we need to have a facility that can really offer protection for our biological diversity of Pub maybe not the most charismatic diversity you don't look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way that you do a panda bear but it's. very important diversity. so we needed a really safe place and we went quite far north to find it. two small Bard in fact this is above Mainland or way you can see green when they're that's it 78�� North it's as far as you can fly on a regularly-scheduled airplane. it's a remarkably beautiful landscape I can't even begin to describe it to you it's otherworldly beautiful we worked with the Norwegian government and with the Norge in the Norwegian genetic resources program to design this facility what you see is an artist's conception of his facility which is Hilton a mountain in svalbard the idea of small barn so we can we get natural freezing temperatures but it's remote it's remote and accessible so it's safe and we don't depend on mechanical Refrigeration. this is more than just an artist dream it's it's now a reality and this next picture shows it's in context in svalbard. and here's the front door of this facility when you open up the front door. this is what you're looking at is pretty simple it's a hole in the ground it's a tunnel that you go into the tunnel chiseled in Solid Rock about 130 M there now a couple of security door so you won't see it quite like this again when you get to the back you get into an area that's really my favorite place I think it is Sir the cathedral and I know this. text me as a bit of a of a nerd but some of the. some of the happiest days of my life has been spent. send it for 5 p.m.. if you were to walk into into one of these rooms I you would see this it's not very exciting but if you know what there is pretty emotional we have now about four hundred and twenty-five thousand samples of unique crop varieties there's seventy thousand samples and different varieties of rice in this facility right now about a year from now we'll have over half a million samples we're going up to over a million and someday we'll basically have samples about 500 seeds of every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state in this facility. this is a backup system for World agriculture to backup system for all the seed banks storage is free it operates like a like a safety deposit box Norway owns the Mets and the facility but the depositors on the seat and if anything happens then they can come back and get it this particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the United States of Canada and international institution from Syria this facility I think is almost the only thing I can think of these days we are countries literally every country in the world because we have seeds from every country in the world all the countries of the world have gotten together to do something that's both long-term sustainable and positive I can't think of anything else that's happened in my lifetime that way I can't look you in the eyes. and tell you that I have a solution for climate change. for the Water Crisis agriculture takes 70% of freshwater supplies on Earth I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that there is such a solution for those things or the energy crisis or world hunger for peace and conflict I can't look in the eyes and tell you that I have a simple solution for that but I can look you in the eyes and tell you that we can't solve any of those problems if we don't have crop diversity because I challenge you to think of a. an effective efficient sustainable solution to climate change if we don't have crop diversity because quite literally if we don't if agriculture doesn't adapt to climate change neither will we. and if crops don't adapt to climate change neither will agriculture neither will we this is not something pretty and nice to do there a lot of people who would love to have this diversity exists just for the Existence value of it it is agreed a nice thing to do but it's a necessary thing to do in and sew in a very real sense I believe that we as an International Community should get organized to complete the task the small Bard Global seed vault is a wonderful gift that Norway and others have given us but it's not the complete answer we need to collect the remaining diversity that's out there we need to put it into good seed banks that can offer those seeds to researchers in the future we need to catalog it it's a library life but right now I would say we don't have a card catalog for it. and we need to support it financially my big idea would be that while we think of it as commonplace to endow an art museum or endow a charity University we really ought to be thinking about in Downing wheat. 30 million dollars in an endowment would take care of preserving all the diversity and wheat forever so we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms and my final thought is that. we of course by conserving sweet rice potatoes and the other crops we met quite simply end up saving ourselves thank you",0.8333333134651184,
95,CatherineMohr_2009.sph.wav,so with the combination of these technologies we can reach it all and we can see it all we can heal the disease and we can leave the patient whole and intact and functional afterwards i've talked about the patient as if the patient is somehow someone abstract outside this room and that is not the case many of you all of you maybe will at some point or have already faced a diagnosis of cancer or heart disease or some organ disfuction that's going to buy you a date with a surgeon and when you get to that point these maladies don't care how many books you've written how many companies you've started that nobel prize you have yet to win how much time you planned to spend with your children these maladies come for us all and the prospect i'm offering you of an easier surgery is that going to make that diagnosis any less terrifying i'm not sure i really even want it to because facing your own mortality causes a re evaluation of priorities and a realignment of what your goals are in life unlike anything else and i would never want to deprive you of that epiphany what i want instead is for you to be whole five to ten thousand years now imagine this you are a healer in a stone age village and you have some guy that you're not quite sure what's wrong with him oliver sacks is going to be born way in the future intact and functional enough to go out and save the world he 's got some seizure disorder and you don't understand this but you think to yourself i 'm not quite sure what's wrong with this guy but maybe if i cut a hole in his head i can fix it now that is surgical thinking now we've got the dawn of interventional surgery here what is astonishing about this is even though we don't know really how much of this was intended to be and so what we are seeing is evidence of a refined technique that was being handed down over thousands and thousands of years talk about surgical robots is also a talk about surgery and while i've tried to make my images not too graphic keep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood than normal people do all over the world this arose independently at sites everywhere that had no communication to one another we really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery now we can fast forward many thousands of years into the bronze age and beyond and we see new refined tools coming out but surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative than their bold trephanating ancestors these guys confined their surgery to fairly superficial injuries and surgeons were tradesmen rather than physicians this persisted all the way into and through the renaissance that may have saved the writers but it didn't really save the surgeons terribly much they were still a mistrusted lot surgeons still had a bit of a pr problem because we were in the age before anesthesia the agony of the patient is really as much of the public spectacle as the surgery itself one of the most famous of these guys frere jacques shown here doing a lithotomy the removal of the bladder stone one of the most invasive surgeries they did at the time had to take less than two minutes you had to have quite a flare for the dramatic and be really really quick and so here you see him doing a lithotomy and he is credited with doing over four thousand of these public surgeries wandering around in europe which is an astonishing number when you think that surgery must have been a last resort i mean who would put themselves through that until anesthesia the absence of sensation this was truly a revolution in surgery but there was a pretty big problem with this after these very long painstaking operations attempting to cure things they'd never been able to touch before because after all what a surgeon does to a patient if it were done without consent would be a felony the patients died they died of massive infection surgery didn't hurt anymore but it killed you pretty quickly and infection would continue to claim a majority of surgical patients until the next big revolution in surgery which was the aseptic technique joseph lister was asepis 's or sterility 's biggest advocate to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons and they said they had learned it was as important to wash your hands before doing surgery as it was to wash up afterwards with the patient insensitive to pain and a sterile operating field all bets were off the sky was the limit you could now start doing surgery the gut on the liver on the heart on the brain transplantation you could take an organ out of one person you could put it in another person and it would surgeons didn't have a problem with respectability anymore they had become gods the era of the big surgeon big incision had arrived surgeons are the tailors the plumbers the carpenters some would say the butchers of the medical world but at quite a cost because they are saving lives but not necessarily quality of life because healthy people don't usually need surgery and unhealthy people have a very hard time recovering from a cut like that the question had to be asked well can we do these same surgeries but through little incisions laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery surgery with long instruments through small incisions and it really changed the landscape of surgery some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique until the nineteen eighties when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that that allowed this to be done for real operations so what you see this is now the first surgical image as we're coming down the tube this is a new entry into the body it looks very different from what you're expecting surgery to look like we bring instruments in from two separate cuts in the side and then you can start manipulating tissue within ten years of the first gallbladder surgeries being done cutting reshaping reforming bypassing fixing but you need to talk about a majority of gallbladder surgeries were being done laparoscopically truly pretty big revolution but there were casualties of this revolution these techniques were a lot harder to learn than people had anticipated the learning curve was very long and during that learning curve the complications went quite a bit higher surgeons had to give up their three d vision they had to give up their wrists they had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments has over three thousand hours of laparoscopic experience now this is a particularly frustrating placement of the needle but this is hard and one of the reasons why it is so hard is because the external ergonomics are terrible you've got these long instruments and you're working off your center line and the instruments are essentially working backwards so what you need to do to take the capability of your hand and put it on the other side of that small incision is you need to put a on that instrument and so i get to talk about robots the da vinci robot put just that wrist on the other side of that and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a trajectory and the reason why this becomes so much easier is you can see the bottom the hands are making the motions and the instruments are following those motions exactly now what you put between those instruments and those hands is a large fairly complicated robot the surgeon is sitting at a console and which is a prostate deep in the pelvis and it requires fine dissection and some kind of a perspective of where we are right now with surgical robots and where we're going to be going in the future i want to give you a little bit of perspective of how we got to this point without cracking the chest this is all done in between the ribs and you can go inside the heart itself and repair the valves from the inside you've got these technologies i talked about the large complicated robot with all its bells and whistles one of those robots will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon but there are other barriers so something like a prostatectomy the prostate is small and it's in one spot and you can set your robot up very precisely to work in that one spot but if you need to reach more places than just one you need to move the robot and you need to put some new incisions in there and you need to re set it up and you need to add some more ports and more and the problem is it gets time consuming and cumbersome and for that reason there are many surgeries that just aren't being done with the da vinci so we had to ask the question well how do we fix that what if we could change it so that we didn't have to re set up each time we wanted to move somewhere different what if we could bring all the instruments in together in one place how would that change the capabilities of the surgeon and how would that change the experience for the patient now to do that we need to be able to bring a camera how we even came to believe that surgery was ok that this was something that was possible to do that this kind of cutting and reforming was ok so a little bit of perspective and instruments in together through one small tube like that tube you saw in the laparoscopy video or not so coincidentally like a tube like this so what's going to come out of that tube is the debut of this new technology this new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere so here it comes this is the camera it has to be able to come off of the center line and then be able to work back toward that center line he 's a cheeky little devil but it's worth it for the freedom that this gives us as we're going around for the patient however it's transparent this is all they're going to see it's very exciting to think where we get to go with this we get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery as we take these capabilities and we get to go to the next places we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be and i think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution we need to not just take our hands in in new ways we also need to take our eyes in in new ways we need to see beyond the surface we need to be able to guide what we're cutting in a much better way this is a cancer surgery one of the problems with this even for surgeons who 've been looking at this a lot is you can't see the cancer especially when it's hidden below the surface about ten thousand years of perspective this is a trephanated skull go bind to the cancer and we can make those markers glow and we can take special cameras and we can look at it now we know where we need to cut even when it's below the surface we can take these markers and we can inject them in a tumor site we can inject these dyes into the bloodstream so that when we sew on a new vessel and we bypass a blockage on the heart we can see if we actually made the connection before we close that patient back up again something that we haven't been able to do without radiation before we can light and we don't even need to confine ourselves to this macro vision we have flexible microscopic probes that we can bring down into the body and we can look at cells directly i'm looking at nerves here so these are nerves you see down on the bottom and the microscope probe that's being held by the robotic hand up at the top so this is all very prototypey at this point but you care about nerves if you are a surgical patient because they let you keep continence bladder control and sexual function after surgery all of which is generally fairly important to the patient,1,"the talk about surgical robots is also a talk about surgery. and while I've tried to make my images not too graphic keep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood than normal people do because after all what a surgeon does to Patient if it were done without consent would be a felony. surgeons are the Taylor's the plumbers the Carpenters fun with a the butcher's of the medical world cutting reshaping reforming bypassing fixing but you need to talk about surgical instruments and the evolution of surgical technology together so in order to give you some kind of a perspective of where we are right now with surgical robots and where we're going to be going in the future I want to give you a little bit of perspective of how we got to this point how we even came to believe that surgery was okay that this was something that was possible to do that this kind of cutting and reforming was okay. it's a little bit of perspective about ten thousand years of perspective this is a trap and a Dead skull and trephination is simply cutting a hole in the skull and many many hundreds of skulls like this have been found in archaeological sites all over the world dating back five to ten thousand years. by the ten thousand years now Imagine This. you are healer in a Stone Age village and you have some guy that you're not quite sure what's wrong with him all of our sex is going to be born way in the future he's got some seizure disorder and you don't understand that's what you think yourself not quite sure what's wrong with this guy but maybe like cut a hole in his head I can fix it. now that surgical thinking we've got the dawn of Interventional surgery here what is astonishing about this is even though we don't know really how much of this was intended to be religious or however much of it was intended to be therapeutic what we can tell is that these patients lived judging by the healing on the borders of these holes they the days months years following trephination. and so what we are seeing is evidence of a refined technique that was being handed down over thousands and thousands of years all over the world this arose independently at sites everywhere they had no communication to one another we really are seeing the dawn of Interventional surgery. now we can fast-forward many thousands of years into the Bronze Age and Beyond and receive new refined tools coming out butt surgeons in these areas are little bit more conservative than their bold fascinating ancestors these guys can find their surgery to fairly superficial injuries and surgeons were Tradesmen rather than Physicians this persisted all the way into and through the Renee songs that may have saved the writers but it didn't really save the surgeons terribly much they were still a mistrust is lot surgeons still had a bit of a PR problem because the landscape was dominated by the itinerant barber-surgeon these were folks that travels from Village to village town to town during surgery sort of as a form of performance art cuz we're in the age before anesthesia and the agony of the patient is really as much of the public spectacle as the surgery itself won the most. most of these guys for a jock shown here doing a sodomy. the removal of the bladder stone one of the most invasive surgeries they did at the time had to take less than 2 minutes you had to have quite a flair for the dramatic and really really quick and so here you see him doing this out of me and he's credited with doing over four thousand of these public surgeries wandering around in Europe which is an astonishing number when you think the surgery must have been a last resort I mean who would put themselves through that. until anesthesia the absence of sensation. with the demonstration of the Morton ether inhaler at the Mass General in 1847 a whole new era of surgery was ushered in a Caesar gave surgeons the freedom to operate anesthesia given the freedom to experiment to start to delve deeper into the body. this was a truly a revolution in surgery but there's a pretty big problem with this after he's very long and painstaking operations attempting to cure things they've never been able to touch before the patients died. they died of massive infection. surgery didn't hurt anymore but it kills you pretty quickly. and infection would continue to claim a majority of surgical patients until the next big revolution in surgery which was aseptic technique. now and Joseph Lister was a substances or sterility his biggest Advocate to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons. but eventually they did come around the Mayo brothers came out to visit Lister in Europe and I came back to their American clinic and they said they had learned it was important to wash your hands before doing surgery as it was to wash up afterwards. something so simple and yet operative mortality dropped profoundly these surgeries were actually now being effective. with the patient insensitive to pain. and a sterile operating field. all bets were off the sky was the limit. you could now start doing surgery everywhere. on the gut on the liver on the heart on the brain transplantation you can take an organ out of one person you can put in another person and it would work. surgeons didn't have a problem with respectability more they had become Gods the era of the big surgeon big incision had arrived. but at quite a cost. they're saving lives but not necessarily quality of life. good healthy people don't usually need surgery and unhealthy people have a very hard time recovering from a cut like that the question had to be asked well can we do the same surgery but two little end stations. laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery surgery with long instruments through small incisions. and it really changed the landscape of surgery some of the tools for this have been around for a hundred years but it only been used as a diagnostic technique until the 1980s when there were changes in camera Technologies and things I got that allowed this to be done for real operations. so what you see this is now the first surgical image as we're coming down the tube this is a new entry into the body of it's very different from what you're expecting surgery to look like we bring instruments in from two separate Cuts in the side and then you can start manipulating tissue. within 10 years of the first gallbladder surgery is being done laparoscopically a majority of gallbladder surgery for being done laparoscopically truly a pretty big revolution. but there were casualties to this revolution. these techniques are a lot harder to learn then people had anticipated the learning curve was very long and during that learning curve the complications went quite a bit higher. surgeons had to give up their 3D Vision they had to give up their wrists they had to give up intuitive motion of the instruments. this surgeon has over 3,000 hours of laparoscopic experience now is a particularly frustrating. placement of the needle but this is hard. and one of the reasons why it is so hard is because the external organ Onyx are terrible you got these long instruments and you're working off your Centerline. and the instruments are essentially working backwards. and so what you need to do to take the capability of your hand and put it on the other side of that small incision if you need to put a wrist on that instrument. and so I get to talk about robots The DaVinci robot put just that rest on the other side of that incision and so here you're seeing the operation of this rest. and now I'm in contrasts the laparoscopy you can precisely place the needle in your instruments and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a trajectory. and the reason why this becomes so much easier as you can see on the bottom the hands are making the motions and the instruments are following those motions exactly now what you put between those instruments and those hands with large fairly complicated robot the surgeons sitting at a console and controlling a robot with these controllers and the robot is moving instruments around and powering them down inside the body. you have a 3D camera so you can get a 3D View and since this was introduced in 1999 a lot of these robots have being out and being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy which is a prostate deep in the pelvis and it requires find dissection and delicate manipulation to be able to get a good surgical outcome. you can also so bypass vessels directly onto a beating heart. without cracking the chest this is all done in between the ribs and you can go inside the heart itself and repair the valves from the inside. you got these Technologies thank you. until you might think this is really cool so smartypants wives and all surgery being done this way and there are some reasons there's some good reasons and cost is one of them talked about the large complicated robot with all its bells and whistles one of those robots will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon more useful than a solid gold surgeon but still it's a fairly big capital investment but once you've got it you your procedure cost to do come down. but there are other barriers so something like a prostatectomy the prostate is small and it's in one spot and you can set your robot up very precisely to work in that one spot and so it's perfect for something like that and in fact if you or anyone you know had their prostate taken out in the last couple of years chances are it was done with one of these systems. but if you need to reach more places than just one you need to move the robot and you need to put some new incisions in there and you need to reset it up and then you need to add some more ports and more. and the problem is it gets time-consuming and cumbersome and for that reason there are many surgeries that just aren't being done with the DaVinci. so we had to ask a question about how do we fix that. what if we could change it to that we didn't have to reset up each time we wanted to move somewhere different what if we could bring all of the instruments in together in one place how would that change the capabilities of the surgeon. and how did that change the experience for the patient. not to do that we need to be able to bring a camera and instruments in together through one small tube like that tube you saw in the laparoscopy video. or not so coincidentally like it to be like this. so what's going to come out of that tube is they did Bo of this new technology this new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere. ready so here it comes. this is the camera and three instruments and as you see it come out in order to actually be able to do anything useful it can't all stay clustered up like this it has to be able to come off of the center line and then be able to work back towards that Centerline. he's a cheeky little devil. but what this lets you do is give you that all-important traction and countertraction so that you can dissect so that you can so so they can do all the things that you need to do all the surgical tasks but it's all coming in through one incision. not so simple. but it's worth it for the freedom that this gives us as we're going around. the patient however. it's transparent this is all they're going to see. very exciting to think where we get to go with this. we get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery as we take these capabilities and we get to go to the next place we get to decide what are our new surgeries are going to be and I think to really get the rest of the way in that Revolution we need to not just take our hands in in new ways we also need to take our eyes in in new ways we need to see beyond the surface we need to be able to guide what we're cutting. in a much better way. this is a cancer surgery. my problems with this even for surgeons who have been looking at this a lot if you can't see the cancer. especially when it's hidden below the surface. and so what we're starting to do is we're starting to inject specially-designed markers into the bloodstream that will Target the cancer and I'll go buy new the cancer and we can make those markers glow and we can take special cameras and we can look at it. and now we know where we need to cut even when it's below the surface. we can take these markers and we can inject them in a tumor site and we can follow where they flow out from that tumor site so that we can see the first places where that cancer might travel. we can inject these guys into the bloodstream so that when we do a new vessel and we bypass a blockage on the heart we can see if we actually made the connection before we close the patient back up again something that we haven't been able to do without radiation before. we can light up tumors like this kidney tumor so that you can exactly see where the boundary is between the kidney tumor and the kidney you want to leave behind or the liver tumor in the liver you want to leave behind. and we don't even need to confine ourselves to this macrovision we have flexible microscopic probes that we can bring down into the body and we can look at cells directly and looking at nerves here so these are nerves you see down on the bottom and the microscope Pro B being held by the robotic hand at the tops is all very prototype be at this point but you care about Nurse if you are a surgical patient because they let you keep continents bladder control and sexual function after surgery all of which is generally fairly important to the patient. so with a combination of these Technologies we can reach it all and we can see it all. we can heal the disease and we can leave the patient whole and intact and functional afterwards. now I talked about the patient as if the patient is somehow someone abstract outside this room and that is not the case. many of you all of you maybe. will at some point or have already faced a diagnosis of cancer or heart disease or some organ dysfunction that's going to buy you a date with a surgeon. and when you get to that point these these maladies don't care. how many books you've written how many companies you started that Nobel Prize you have yet to win how much time you planned to spend with your children. these maladies come for us all. and the prospect I'm offering you of an easier surgery is that going to make that diagnosis any less terrifying. I'm not sure I really even want it to. because facing your own mortality causes a re-evaluation of priorities and a realignment of what your goals are in life unlike anything else and I would never want to deprive you of that epiphany. what I want instead. is for you to be whole. intact and functional enough to go out and save the world after you've decided you need to do it and that is my vision for your future. thank you",0.7526041865348816,
99,CharlesFleischer_2005.sph.wav,i didn't just draw this in a day by the way you know try making some charts like this at home you gotta be accurate there's measurement involved increments these are maps by the way not stamps but one day this is the moon people could live there one day i'll meet you at frigoris no i don't think so punch golden ratio it's crazy and look at this built within it is the golden ratio i start looking at that and look at them again they start looking like planets i go to was right days in a year there we see mars again with various names and this is all done by the way by the international astronomical union this is an actual group of people that sit around naming planetary objects this is from their actual book these are some of the names that they have chosen ladies and gentlemen i'll go through a little of them bolotnitsa that of course is the slavic swamp mermaid the whole concept of a mermaid doesn't really blend into the swamp feel look fluctus if that don't flow off the tongue what mean kids are studying this stuff and they've got the word fluctus up there that's wrong i am going to be talking about secrets obviously the best way to divulge a secret is to tell someone to not say anything about it that's a little more flowing hikuleo sounds like a kind of a leonardo dicaprio really i'm so busy with the stars would you mind taking the insects thank you darling oh take the spiders too i know they're not insects but i don't care monkeys chimps just get rid of now we're going to be going to mars one day and when we do it's going to be unfair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridiculous names so you'll be on mars and your at hellespointica depressio which has got to be a really up place yeah i'm at the depressio and i want to get over to amazonis so i plug it into the mars map and click the button and there's my directions cool name i will say that so i hold back a little of my venom for these astronomical misnomers and then of course arnon to and of course there will be advertisements this is from their rule book the international astronomical union and you know their international because they put it international for those of you who don't speak french i thought i'd translate for you from the rulebook nomenclature is a tool the first consideration make it clear simple and unambiguous and i think that djabran fluctus that fits that simple the goddess of goats very simple djabran fluctus now frank is this clear to you djabran fluctus yeah also from the actual document i highlighted a part i thought may be of interest anyone can suggest changing a name so i look to you fellow member of the earth community we've got to change this stuff up fast so these are actual names of people that work there i did some more investigation these are more people working for this group and as you can see they don't use their first names and when you use these things you don't have to go like that these are people naming planets and they won 't use their first names something is askew here is it because his name is really jupiter that mars i don't know but it's investigative material no doubt there are some mapping people who do use their names witness please eugene shoemaker make maps that 's wonderful eugene you could make maps of toronto no i want to make maps of planets seems a little silly to me there are no jovians getting back to my premise i used stamps by the way because you don't have to pay anybody for the rights by the way that's a natural picture of saturn no adjustments i mean that's just beautiful so beautiful that i will even give up a laugh to explain my love of this particular planet and the day saturday named after it wonderfully so formulas relate number to form that's euler his formula was one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory which is kind of cool not that funny but it is cool yes he was also famous for having no body which is one of the five sacred solids very important shapes you see the icosahedron again the dodecahedron it's dual there is a dodecahedron which i had to do in my room last night the five sacred solids as you can see there which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads i'm sure just change blue cheese ranch oil and vinegar thousand islands and house i suggest the house the reality now here is something important what's important about this is these shapes are duals of each other and you can see how the icosahedron withdraws into the dodecahedron and then they just merge into each other so the whole concept of branes in the universe if the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron this is is a very good map of what could possibly be and that is of course what we are here to talk about what a coincidence october in france jean pierre luminet said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron based on information that they got from this probe this would be a normal wave pattern but what they're seeing way out there in the far reaches of the microwave background is this kind of odd undulation it doesn't what they suspected a flat universe would be so you can kind of get and idea from this extrapolating bill gates the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger and for me really hurry up i just threw this in because as important as all of our intellectual abilities are without heart and without love it's just it's all meaningless and that to me is really beautiful back to the point of my particular presentation kepler one of my great who realized that these five solids which i spoke of earlier were related somehow to the planets but he couldn't prove it it freaked him out but it did lead to i am not suggesting at all that my vietnamese brothers and sisters could maybe use a little art class here and there but that's not my slides but it's okay not a good picture now my friends in the island of nevis are a little better look at that what a handsome cat once again nicaragua let me down and copurnicus looks like johnny carson which is really that at all once again these guys rock it out isaac is kickin ass man he looks like a rock star this is freaky is a major way this is sierra leone they got little babies in there floating in i don't really need to comment on this but i didn't know that isaac newton was in the moody blues as you can see these are all maps and maps are important devices for transferring information especially if you have human cognitive ability it's a different kind of course and they've got five apples i mean these guys are extrapolating in realms that are not necessarily valid although five is a good number of course ecuador my friend kepler as you can see this is of course the cartesian coordinates once again that's sierra leone this is again indicating how numbers relate to space relate to form maps of the universe because that's why we're here really i think now monaco took descartes and just flipped him around now monaco is problematic for me and i'll show you why here is a map all they have is a casino on and why franklin delano roosevelt is on their map i don't even want to hazard a guess but i'd say he'd been to hellespointica depressio recently this is the flag of monaco ladies and gentlemen the flag of indonesia please examine not sure how this came to be but it's not right in monaco no what are you talking about they are so different look ours is more red it's longer was a guy named titus and the reason i just bring this up because it is a law that doesn't really work that's jude law and some of his films we can see that all formulas are really maps now as humans we make maps of places that we seldom even go which seems a little wasteful of time this of course is a map of the moon prime numbers gauss one of my favorites golden section i've been obsessed with this thing since before i was born that scares a lot of you but that was my purpose entirely there we can see fibonacci numbers related to the golden section because fibonacci and golden section relate to the unfolding of the measured meter of mater as i refer to it if fibonacci had been on paxil that alright where is this going that's a good question here is the premise that i began twenty seven years ago if numbers can express the laws of this incredible universe that we live i reason through some sort of reverse engineering we could extrapolate from them some basic structural element of this universe and that's what i did twenty seven years ago i started working on this and i tried to build a particle accelerator and that didn't work out well so then i thought a calculator is a metaphor i can just divide numbers that's like atom smashing that's what i did that's how i found moleeds moleeds are what i believe the thing that will allow string to be proved they are the nodes on the string patterns and relationships twenty seven thirty seven that was the first chart i came up with you can see even if you don't go for the numbers the beauty of the symmetry the numbers from one to thirty six divided into six groups symmetry pairs every top adds up to thirty seven bottom all seventy four there is so many intricate relationships that i'm not going to go there now because you would say hey go back to the fluctus circle of fifths acoustic harmony geometric symmetry i knew those two were related once again the cartesian kind of some very delightful names tranquilacalitis my favorite is frigoris what are these people thinking frigoris what the frigoris you doing names are so i said if i'm going to put a circle see what kind of patterns i get boom the red system look at that you can't just make this stuff you'll see over here these are multiples of the number twenty seven and they recapitulate that shape even though that's a circle of nine and that's a circle of thirty six make that stuff of a tree ladies and gentlemen here at ted why because this is the place if aliens land i hope they come here last year i have found these subsequent systems which allow for the mathematic possibilities of the calabi yau manifolds in a way that doesn't necesitate these little hidden dimensions which works mathematically but it just doesn't seem god like to me it just seems like it's not sexy and elegant it's hidden i don't want hidden is like crazy am i the only one that sees this,1,I am going to be talkin about Secrets obviously the best way to the vulture secret is to tell someone not to say anything about it. Secrets time using PowerPoint this you just because you know I'm into the tent thing. tell me you see since you don't have to go like that you just press it. man. yes I'm sure just change it. Bill Gates. okay that's not my slides but it's okay. as you can see these are all maps and maps are important devices for transferring information especially if you have a human cognitive abilities we can see that all formulas are really Maps now as soon as we make maps of places that we sell them even go which seems a little wasteful of time this if course has a map of the moon this is very delightful name is trying to like a l system North my favorite is for goris what are these people thinking from Boris from Boris you doing names are important for courses the moon people can live there one day I'll meet you at 4 goris I don't think so. near we see Mars again with various names and this is all done by the way by the international astronomical Union this is an actual group of people that sit around and naming planetary objects this is from their actual book this is some of the names that they have chosen ladies and gentleman through a little of them Slavic swamp mermaid blend into the swamp field.. the Jabra talk this is that don't flow off the tongue. how many kids are studying this stuff and I got the worst luck this up there that's wrong one dyslexic kid and he could be ruining his life. mama. hi Cleo floppies that's a little more flowing High Coolio sounds like a can of Leonardo DiCaprio 17-syllable thing and that's the tongue of the underworld and one of my favorites is the Atoka fluctus who is the Nicaraguan goddess of insects stars and planets not if you're a goddess of stars and planets to somebody else. really really I'm so busy with the stop sign ticket in Texas thank you darling. now we're going to be going tomorrow is one day then we do it's going to be unfair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridiculous names so you'll be on Mars in the precio just got to be a really up place. yeah I'm at the de precio and I want to go over to Amazon is so I plugged it into the Mars map and click the button in this my directions are go to Christmas.. Just to the side of my back a little of my Venom please astronomical mixed numbers going to call us or until soft and of course they will be advertisements this is from their rule book The International astronomical Union and you know their International because they put it as well. Union Hospital make international for those of you who don't speak French right that I translate for you from the rulebook the first consideration make it clear and unambiguous and I think the Gibran fluctus that fits that mow. what's the temple of God it's a good very simple you bought this and I'm not going back to the swamp mermaid can you call me a little while. also from the actual document I highlighted the part I thought maybe Ventures anyone can suggest changing your name so I Look to You fellow members of the earth Community we got to change this stuff up fast so these are actual names of people that work there and did some more investigation these are more people working for this group and as you can see I don't use the first dance. these people named me planets and they won't use the first name something is asked you here. is it because his name is really you put your blunt. is that Ganymede Andromeda purple is that Mars yamara I don't know but it's investigative material no doubt there are some mapping people who do use the names what does please Eugene Shoemaker who diligently from a young boy decided he wanted to make maps of celestial bodies must have been a very interested in the Schumacher house if it's wonderful you do need to make matches out of Toronto and I want to make maps of a planet Martian venusian Jovian do we have names for places where people don't exist that seems a little silly to me there are no jovians getting back to my premise are you staying by the way cuz you'll have to pay anybody for the rights. spell obviously Einstein deals boy from outside sphere and then I'm not sure whether that's James Coburn Richard Harris. definitely one of the two I'm not really clear which one but obviously the point is that numbers are mass and within numbers is there an underlying secret to the universe that is the premise of this particular presentation by the way that's a natural picture saturno just assuming that if that's your beautiful so beautiful that I will even give up I left to explain my love of this particular planet and the day Saturday evenings after a wonderfully formalist relating I'm looking for him that's spoiler he is a Formula was one of The Inspirations that led to beginning of string theory just kind of what are the school. he was also famous for having no body. which a lot of people. Linda that's an icosahedron which is one of the five sacred solids very important shapes you see that cost that he'd run again at the dodecahedron its dual there is a dodecahedron what you had to do my room last night the five sacred solid as you can see there which is not to be confused with the Thai chicken salads. blue cheese ranch willing to get a thousand islands and house I suggest the house. do a Latina here's some important cuz what's the point of each other and you can see how the icosahedron withdraws into the dodecahedron and then they just merge into each other so whole concept of brains in the University of the universe to ship like a dodecahedron this is a very good map of what could possibly be and that is of course what we're here to talk about what a coincidence in France jumpy aluminum said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron based on information that they got from this Pro this would be a normal wave pattern but what they're seeing way out there in the far reaches of the microwave background is this kind of relationship doesn't plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be so you can kind of get an idea from this extrapolating that back into this huge picture so we get this idea of what the Primal Universe look like and judging from this it looks a little like a cheeseburger. so I'm thinking the university there is Bill Dickey he'd run of a cheeseburger and for me that's a win-win.better really hurry up I just threw this in because this is important as all of our intellectual abilities are with all my heart and when I love it's just it's not meaningless and that to me is really beautiful. except for that creepy guy in the background. getting back to the point of my heroes who realize that these five songs we just spoke of earlier we're related somehow we couldn't prove it freaked them out but it did lead to Newton discover gravity so maps of things leading to organize understandings of universe in which we emerged now this is Isaac from a Vietnamese sandwich. I'm not suggesting at all that my Vietnamese brothers and sisters could maybe use a little art class here in that but. that's not a good picture. not a good picture now my friends in the island of Nevis serve a little bit look at that that's Isaac guy is rocking. what a handsome cat once again Nicaragua let me down. and Copernicus looks like a Johnny Carson which is really weird I don't get that at all once again these guys rock it up this is freaky in a major way this is Sierra Leone. when I don't really need to comment on this but I didn't know that Isaac Newton was in The Moody Blues did you. when did this happen. different kind of course and if they got five apples extrapolating in rooms that are not necessarily pallet holding five is a good number of course Ecuador my friend Kepler as you can see they call him Juan. one wasn't Carlos Chaplin. Rene Descartes of course once again these Granada people this is like way too sick for anybody's imagination he's all murky this little kids leaving on his leg Little Ghost flying around we got to clean this stuff this is of course the you cut T-shirt coordinates once again at Sierra Leone this is again indicating how numbers relate to space relate to form maps of the universe cuz that's where we hid it really I think the figure stuff out and do love each other they car before there's. no Monica took the car and just flip them around I'm running cool is problematic for me to show you why there's a map all they have is the casino on it. and why Franklin Delano Roosevelt is on there map I don't even want to Hazard a guess but I'd say he's been to Hell appointed esprillo recently this is the flag of Monaco there's a German flag of Indonesia please examine. not sure how this came to be but it's not write you back and then Monica took me about the. bode's law has lost game doesn't really work that Jude Law and some of his films. is the correlation that indicates how things misinterpreted and I'll get you could you touch your tooth. give me a photograph or like press pictures don't touch your teeth. prime numbers gospel my favorites golden section I've been obsessed with this thing since before I was born. I know that scares a lot of people but that was my purpose entirely there we can see Fibonacci numbers related to the golden section because then I said golden six relate to the unfolding the measured M matter as I refer to it if it were not a dump axle. that would be the table. You serious tell me what round was born in Oregon. taking pills yes or no. alright where is this going that's a good question here's the premise that I begin 27 years ago if numbers can express the laws of this Incredible Universe that we live I read into some sort of reverse engineering we can extrapolate from them some basic structural element of this universe and that's what I did 27 years ago I started working on this and I tried to build up a particle accelerator. and it didn't work out well so then I thought leaders and metaphor I can just divide numbers that's like atom-smashing that's what I did that's how I found moley Moley these are what I believe the thing that would allow String Theory to be proved they are the note on the string patterns and relationships 2737 that was the first Charter came up with you can see even if you don't go for the numbers the beauty of the Symmetry the numbers from 1 to 36 divided into six groups symmetry are very top as up at 2:37 bottom or 74 is so many intricate relationships that I'm not going to go then I could you say it. go back to the Flop the spot. circle of fifths acoustic Harmony geometric symmetry I knew those two were related once again the Cartesian kind of crossover so I said if I'm going to put the circle he will kind of patents I get the red system. you can't just go around in a circle and they're going to be symmetrical and it's going to be all this is beyond anything anybody could just make up there's the orange system. and you'll see over here these are multiples of the number 27 and they recapitulate that shape. are all tolls in half of the green sitting right between 18 and 19 the blue system. who did I make that stuff up. 27 years of my life. Brazilian here and head why cuz this is the place of aliens land I hope they come here. in this last year I have found the subsequent systems which allow for the mathematic possibilities of the cloud by Young manifolds in a way that doesn't necessarily take these little hidden Dimensions which works mathematically but it just doesn't seem God like to me it just seems like it's not sexy and elegant it's hidden. I found the other Pez all have symmetry even though unlike the mass when their symmetry is split. I didn't just draw this in a day by the way. we got to be accurate this measurement involved by the way my stamps for one day. okay I'm getting to the punch golden ratio it's crazy and look at this built within it is the golden ratio to kpl I look at the orbits of the planets I find 18 examples of it in our solar system I never told me about this is the first thing this could be history.Kepler was right. 18 and 19 in middle of the male 618 X together 365 247 which is different from the number of days in a year hey you can't make this up. thank you very much. thank you. thank you,,
100,CharlesMoore_2009U.sph.wav,in spite of deposit fees much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles we use two million of them in the united states every five minutes

under the bottle bills after ten years a lot of the japanese caps are in what we call the eastern garbage patch while ours litter the philippines after twenty years we see emerging the debris

also have consequences for aquatic animals this is mae west still alive at a zookeeper 's home in new orleans i wanted to see what my home town of long beach was contributing to the problem so on coastal clean up day in two thousand and five i went to the long beach peninsula after the war we needed to direct our enormous production capacity toward creation of products for peacetime at the east end of our long beach we cleaned up the swaths of beach shown i offered five cents each for bottle caps i got plenty of takers here are the one thousand one hundred bottle caps they collected i thought i would spend twenty bucks that day i ended up spending nearly sixty i separated them by color and put them on display the next earth day at cabrillo marine aquarium in san pedro governor schwarzenegger and his wife maria stopped by to discuss the display in spite of my girly man hat i showed him and maria a zooplankton trawl from the gyre north of hawaii with more plastic than plankton here 's what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile produces samples like this now when the debris washes up on the beaches of hawaii it looks like this and this particular beach is kailua beach the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to washington now how do we analyze samples like this one that contain more plastic than plankton life magazine helped in this effort by announcing the introduction of throwaways that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes we sort the plastic fragments into different size classes from five millimeters to one third of a millimeter small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater we wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean at the base of the food chain was ingesting these poison pills we did hundreds of necropsies and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs the record holder only two and a half inches long had eighty four pieces in its tiny stomach now you can buy certified organic produce but no fish monger on earth can sell you a certified organic wild caught fish this is the legacy we are leaving to future generations the throwaway society cannot be contained it has gone global we simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff we have to throw it away together again levels are increasing the amount of packaging is increasing the throwaway concept of

101,ChrisAbani_2008.sph.wav,someone who is trying to drive their car and drink coffee and send emails and make notes so what ubuntu really says is that there is no way for us to be human without other people very complicated so i thought i should some stories i should tell you some stories about remarkable people so i thought i'd start with my mother and she was dark my mother was english my parents met in oxford in the fifties and my mother moved to nigeria and she was five foot two very feisty and very english this is how english my mother is or was she just passed she came out to california to los angeles to visit me and we went to malibu which she thought was very and then we went to a fish restaurant and we had chad the surfer dude serving us and he came up and my mother said do you have any specials my mother turned to me and said what i said english mum and she shook her head and said so this woman who converted from the church of england to catholicism when she married my father and there's no one more rabid than a catholic convert decided to teach in the rural areas in nigeria particularly among igbo women the billings ovulation method which was the only approved birth control by the catholic church wasn't too good so she took me along to translate never discuss their period with their husbands how swollen is your vulva she never would have thought of herself as a feminist my mother but she always used to say anything a man can do i can fix and when my father complained about this situation where she's taking a seven year old boy to teach this birth control you know he used to say oh you're turning him into you're teaching him how to be a woman my mother said someone has this woman during the biafran war we were caught in the war it was my mother with five little children it takes her one year through refugee camp after refugee camp to make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country at every single refugee camp she has to face off soldiers who want to take my elder brother mark who was nine and make him a boy soldier can you imagine this five foot two woman standing up to men with guns who want to kill us all through that one year my mother never cried one time not but when we were in lisbon in the airport about to fly to england it was basically see through with five really hungry looking kids came over and asked her what had happened and she told this woman and so this woman emptied out her suitcase and all of her clothes to my mother and to us and the toys of her kids who didn't like that very much look away from the darkest things about us because any kind of horror but the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger will unstitch you the old women in my father 's village after this war and they would sing these dirges made up of these names dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you i really believe that we're never more beautiful than when we're most ugly because that's really the moment we really know what we're made of and they would sing them only when they planted the as though they were seeding the hearts of the dead but when it came for harvest time they would sing these joyful songs that were made up of the names of every child who had been born that these women enacted a lot of transformation and the word for marriage was the same one rebuilding rwanda did you also know that after apartheid when the new government went into the parliament houses which would seem to suggest that apartheid was entirely the business of men all of this to say never really counted always rites of passage for young men men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women that's essentially what it is and a lot of rituals involved killing little animals progressing along so when i turned thirteen and i mean it made sense it was agrarian community somebody had to kill the animals there was no whole foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at so when i turned thirteen it was my turn now to kill a goat chris said i grew up in nigeria with a whole generation in the eighties of students who were protesting a military dictatorship which has finally ended so it wasn't just me there was a whole generation of us this weird sensitive kid who couldn't really do it but i had to do it and i was supposed to do this alone but a friend of mine called emmanuel who was significantly older than me who 'd been a boy soldier during the biafran war decided to come with me which sort of made me feel good because he'd seen a lot of things now when i was growing up he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people and their intestines would fall out but they would keep running so this guy comes with me and i don't know if you've ever heard a goat or seen one they sound like human beings my friend brad kessler says we didn't become human until we started keeping goats a goat 's eyes are like a child puts his hand over the mouth of the goat covers this guy who 'd seen so much and who to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed such a quotidian experience still found it in himself to try to protect me i was a wimp i cried for a very long time and afterwards he didn't say a word he just sat there watching me cry for an hour and then afterwards he said to me it will always be difficult but if you cry like this every time you will die of just know that it is enough sometimes to know that it is difficult i was born two days after christmas so growing up you know i had a cake and everything but i never got any presents because born two days after christmas about nine and my uncle had just come back from germany and we had the catholic priest over my mother was entertaining him with tea and my uncle suddenly says where are chris presents and but what i've come to learn but he was desperate to show that he'd just come back so he summoned me up and he said go into the bedroom my bedroom take anything you want out of the is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures but in the simple he thought i'd take a book but i found an inflatable sheep waving this buzzing sheep around was completely unflustered just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said it 's all right daphne i'm scottish my last days in prison my cellmate was fourteen years old the name was john james if a family member committed a crime so here was this fourteen year old kid on death row and he had smuggled in two comics two comic books spiderman and x men he was obsessed and when he got tired of reading them he started to teach the men in death row how to read with these comic books and so i remember night after night you'd hear all these men these really hardened criminals huddled around john james reciting take that spidey say how do you know and he said oh i heard it on the they handcuffed him to a chair in south africa they have a phrase called that they built their own gods come together as a community and their wish would then be brought to a priest who would find a ritual object and the appropriate sacrifices would be made became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice destroy the god they would knock down the shrine we're building gods that have gone rampant time we started knocking them their names it doesn't require a tremendous thing all it requires is to recognize among us every day the few of us that can see are surrounded by people amazing people who offer all of us the mirror to our own only way for me to be human is for you to reflect my humanity back at me but if you're like me my humanity is more like a window i don't really see it i don't pay attention to it until i want to end with a poem by an american poet called lucille clifton the poem is called libation and it's for my friend vusi who is in the audience here i offer to this ground i imagine an old man crying here out of the sight of the overseer he pushes his tongue where his tooth would be if he in that space where his tooth would be where his land would be his house his wife beautiful daughter he wipes sorrow from his face and puts his thirsty finger to his thirsty tongue and tastes the salt i call a name that could be his this is for you like a bug that's dead on the window then suddenly i see it and usually it's never good it's usually when i'm cussing in traffic,1,"my searches. always to find ways to to Chronicle to share and to document stories about people just Everyday People stories that offer transformation that lenient sentence but that I never sentimental that never look away from the darkest things about us because I really believe that we're never more beautiful the one where most ugly cuz that's really the moment we really know what we're made of. Christina he grew up in Nigeria with a whole generation on the 18th of students who were protesting a military dictatorship which has finally ended it wasn't just me it was a whole generation of us but what I've come to learn is that the world is never saved in Grandma's Van Dyke gestures but in the simple accumulation of gentle soft almost invisible acts of compassion everyday acts of compassion. in South Africa they have a phrase called a boon to the boom 2 comes out of a philosophy that says the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect your him and make him and get back with me but if you like me my Humanities more like a window I don't really see it I don't pay attention to it until there's a new don't like a bug that's dead on the window then suddenly I see it and usually it's never good to see what I'm cussing in traffic at someone who is trying to drive the car I'm drink coffee and and send emails and can make note of what a Bluetooth when he says is that there's no way for us to be human without other people it's really very simple but really very complicated so I thought I should start with some stories I could tell you some stories about remarkable people with my mother. and she was Doc to my mother was English my parents met in Oxford in the fifties and my mother moved to Nigeria and live there she was five foot two very feisty and very English this is how English my mother is or was she just passed she she came out to California to Los Angeles to visit me and we went to Malibu what she thought was very disappointing and then we went to Fish restaurant and we had Chad the surfer dude seven us and he came up and my mother said Jimmy specials young man and and Chad says show like we have this like Simon does like rolled in Ibis Wassabi like crossed totally bad. my mother just turned to me and said what language is he speaking. I said English mom and she shook her head and said all these Americans we gave them a language why don't they use it. so this woman who converted from the church of England to Catholicism by father and there's no more than a Catholic convert decided to teach in the rural areas in Nigeria particular women the Billings ovulation method which was the only approved first controlled by the Catholic church but evil wasn't too good so she took me along to translate I was seven. so here are these women. you never discussed it. With the husband and here I am telling them how often do you get your. And do you notice any discharges and house warming is your vulva. she said she never would have thought of it as my mother but Sam but she always used to say anything a man can do I can fix. and when my father complained about this situation where she's taking a seven year old boy to teach the birth control to say all your turning them into a week teaching him how to be a woman my mother said someone has to write this woman is my mother with five little children. it takes a one-year to refugee camp out to refugee camp to make a way to an Astra but we can fly out of the country at every single Refugee, she has to Face Off soldiers who want to take my elder brother Mark who's 9 and make him a Boy Soldier standing up to man with a gun so I want to kill us all through that one year and my mother never cried want I'm not once but when we were in Lisbon and the airport about to fly to England this summer so my mother wearing this dress which has been washed so many times it was basically see through with five really hungry looking kids came over and asked her what had happened and she told this woman and sold to someone emptied out his suitcase and gave all of her clothes to my mother and two outs in the toys are for kids who didn't like that very much but that's the only time she try to remember you as to why did you cry then. she said you know you can steal your heart against any kind of trouble any kind of horror but the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger would love to get you. the old man in my father's Village after this war hadn't happened memorize the names of every dead person. and they would sing these judges made up of these names judges so melancholic that they would Scorch you and it would seem them only when they planted the rights as though it was feeding the house of the dead into the rice but when it came for Harvest time it would sing his joyful songs that were made up of the names of every child have been born that chair. and then the next planting season when they send the judge they would remove as many names of the dead at people as many people that were born and then this way these women enacted a lot of transformation beautiful transformation. did you know that before the genocide in Rwanda the word for rape and the word for marriage was the same one. but today women are rebuilding for Wanda. did you also know that offered a part-time when the new government went into the parliament houses there was no female toilets in the building. which would seem to suggest that a pot that is in town and The Business of men. all of this to say that despite the horror despite the death women and never really counted that Humanity never seems to matter very much to us. when I was growing up in Nigeria in and I shouldn't say Niger cuz that's two general in the air who was the evil part of the country where I'm from the always Rites of Passage for young man man who taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women to finish to it it is a lot of rituals involve killing killing little animals progressing along so when I turned thirteen and agrarian Community somebody has to kill the animals I also know he know Whole Foods you could go and get kind of the steak at when I junked it was my turn now to kill a goat. and I just weird things if kid who can really do it but I have to do it and it's supposed to do this alone but a friend of mine call Emmanuel who was significantly older than a Boy Soldier during the bathroom wall decided to come with me. and which sort of made me feel good because he'd seen a lot of things when I was growing up used to tell me stories about how he used to be in that people and the intestines would fall out but they would keep running. so this guy comes with me and I don't know if you've ever heard a goat of someone they sound like human beings that's why we called tragedies a song of a goat my friend by Tesla says that we didn't become human until we started keeping goats. anyway a goat size like a child's eyes. so I tried to kill this girl and I couldn't get my no bent down and put his hand over the mouth of the goat covers his eyes so I don't have to look into them while I kill the goat. didn't seem like a lot this guy who seemed so much and who to whom the killing of her goat must have seen such a cotillion experience still found it in himself to try to protect me. I was a wimp I tried so very long time and I'm still Woods he didn't say where he just sat there watching me cry. And then after what she said to me it will always be difficult. but if you cry like this every time you will die of heartbreak. just know that it is enough sometimes to know that it is difficult. of course talking about go to makes me think of sheep and not in good ways to days after Christmas so boring out if you know I have the cake and everything but I never got any presents because the bond 2 days after Christmas does about 9 and my uncle just come back from Germany and we had the the Catholic priest over my mother was entertaining him with Chief and my uncle suddenly says why it was great Christmas presents. but I'm he was desperate to show but he just come back so he summoned me up when he said go into the bedroom my bedroom take anything you want out of the suitcase it's your birthday present. so he thought I'd take a broke or shut but I found an inflatable sheep run into the living room my finger where it shouldn't have been. I was waving this buzzing sheep around and my mother look like she was going to die of shock. father mcgetrick was completely on flaster just said his team looks my mother said it's all right Daphne I'm Scottish. my last. my last days in prison. the last 18 months my soulmate. for the last year the first year of the last 18 months my soulmate was 14 years old. name was John James and in those days if a family member committed a crime the military would hold you as Ransom so your family tell themselves soon so he has his fourteen-year-old kid on death row prisoner if there was some really bad people there and he smuggled into Comics to comic books Spider-Man and X-Men who's obsessed and when he got tired of reading them he started to teach the man in death row how to read with these comic books and so I remember night after night you heal this man this really hard and criminals huddled around him James reciting take that Spidey. incredible. when I was really worried I have been he would he didn't know what death row man. I've been there twice and I was terribly afraid that I was going to die and he's always laugh and say come on man will make it when I see how do you know and he said I heard it on the Grapevine. they killed him. they handcuffed him to a chair. they talked his penis to a table with a 6-inch now. and left them there. to bleed to death. that's how I ended up in solitary because I let my feelings be known. all around us everywhere. they're people like this. the Evo used to say that they built their own Gods they would come together as a community. I do it expressed a wish and their wish would that be brought to a priest who would find and ritual object and the appropriate sacrifices will be made and the shrine will be built for the god. but if the god became unruly and began to ask for Human Sacrifice the evils would destroy the god it would knock down the shrine and there was stop saying the gods name. which is how they came to reclaim their Humanity everyday all of us here with building gods that have gone rampant it's time we started knocking them down. not forgotten that names. it doesn't require a tremendous thing all it requires is to recognize Among Us everyday the few of us that can see a surrounded by people like the ones I've told that some of you in this from amazing people. who off of all of us the mirror to our own Humanity. I want to end with a poem by an American poet called Lucille Clifton the poem is called libation and it's for my friend Lucy who's in the audience here somewhere. libation. North Carolina 1999. I offer to this ground this Jinn. I imagine an old man crying here out of the sight of the overseer. he pushes his tongue through a hole where his tooth would be if he were whole. it takes in that space where he's tooth would be where his land would be his house his wife his son his beautiful daughter. he wipes sorrow from his face and puts he's thirsty finger to be thirsty tongue and taste the salt. I called a name that could be his. this is for you old man. this gin is salty. thank you. I thought you.",,
102,ChrisAnderson_2002.sph.wav,and all this had come from nothing fifteen years earlier i was a science journalist who people just laughed at when i said i really would like to start my own computer magazine and fifteen years later there are there are one hundred of them and two thousand people on staff and it was just such heady times the date was february two thousand i thought the little of my business life that kind of looked a bit like moore 's law ever upward onto the right it was going to go on forever i mean it had to i was in for quite a surprise the dot com ironically called snowball was the very last consumer web company to go public the next month before nasdaq exploded and i entered eighteen months of business hell i saw i watched everything that this is your conference and i think you have a right to know a little bit right now in this transition period about this guy who 's going to be looking after it for you for crumbling and it looked like all this stuff was going to die and fifteen years work would have come for nothing in the business february two thousand and one in one day we laid off three hundred and fifty people and before the bloodshed was finished one thousand people had lost their jobs from from my companies by about a million dollars a day every day for eighteen months and worse than that far worse than that my sense of self worth was kind of evaporating i was going around with this big sign on my forehead loser and i think what disgusts me more than anything looking back is how the hell did i let my personal happiness get so tied up with this business thing in the end we were able to save future and snowball but i was at that point ready to move on and to cut a long story short here 's where i came to and the reason i'm telling this story is that i believe from many conversations that a lot of people in this room have been through a similar kind of rollercoaster emotional rollercoaster in the last couple years this has been a big big transition time and i believe that this conference can a big part for all of us in taking us forward to the next stage to whatever 's next the theme next year is re birth it was at the same ted two years ago when richard and i reached an agreement on the future of ted and at about the same time and i think partly because of that i started doing something that i'd forgotten about in my business focus i started to read again and i discovered that while i'd been busy playing business games there'd been this incredible revolution in so many areas of interest cosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropology to you know all this stuff had changed and the way in which you could think about us as a species and us as a planet had just changed so much and it was incredibly exciting and what was really most exciting and i think richard wurman discovered this at least twenty years before i did was that all this stuff is connected it's connected it all hooks into each other we talk about this a lot and i thought about trying to of this just one example madame de gaulle the wife of the french president was famously asked once what do you most desire and she and when you think about it it's very true what we all most desire is a penis or you know happiness as we say in english that one in the japanese translation today it turns out that there's dozens of ted like questions that you can ask about it which are really interesting you can ask about what causes it biochemically neuroscience serotonin all that stuff years ago at ted i think i've come to this conclusion i think i may have been suffering from a strange delusion you can ask what are the psychological causes of it nature nurture current circumstance turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind blowing you can view it as a computing problem an artificial intelligence problem why do you need to incorporate some sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly you can view it in sort of geopolitical terms and say why is it that a billion people on this planet are so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness and whereas almost all the rest of them or you can view it as an evolutionary psychology kind of thing why would our did our genes invent this as a kind of trick to get us to behave in certain ways brain parasitized to make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate are we the victims of a mass delusion and so to understand even something as important to us as happiness you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions and there's nowhere that i've discovered other than ted where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions and so it's the profound thing that richard talks about to understand you just need to understand the little bits a little bit about everything that surrounds it and so gradually over these three days you start off kind of trying to figure out why am i listening to all this irrelevant stuff and at the end of the four days brain is humming and you feel energized alive and excited and it's because all these different bits have been put together it's the total brain experience we're going to it's the mental equivalent of the full body massage every mental i think that i may have believed unconsciously then that i was kind of a business hero really is enough of the theory chris tell us what you're actually going to do all right so i will here 's the vision for ted number one do nothing this thing ain't broke so i jeff bezos kindly remarked to me chris ted is a really great conference you're going to have to fuck up really badly so i gave myself the job title of ted diversity no selling no corporate bullshit no bandwagoning no platforms just the pursuit of interest wherever it lies across all the disciplines that are represented here that's not going to be changed at all the time scale on which ted operates is just fantastic after coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines there's a year to do this and already as i hope to show you a bit later there's twenty five or so terrific speakers signed up for next year had this company that i'd spent fifteen years building it was called future it was a magazine publishing company it had recently gone public do want to if i can find a way of extending the ted experience throughout the year and one key way that we're going to do this is to introduce this book club books kind of saved me in the last couple years and that's a gift that i would like to pass on so when you sign up for ted two thousand and three every six weeks you'll get a care package with a book or two and a reason why they're linked to ted they may well be by a ted speaker i think it will be great and then fourthly i want to mention the foundation which is the new owner of ted what sapling 's ownership means is that all of the proceeds of ted will go towards the causes that sapling stands for and more important i think the ideas that are exhibited and realized here ideas that the foundation can use because there's fantastic synergy already just in the last few days we've had so many people talking about stuff that they care about that they're passionate about that can make a difference in the world and the idea of getting this group of people together some of the causes that we believe in the money that this conference can raise and the ideas i really believe that that combination will and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars a number i didn't really understand time make a difference i'm incredibly excited about that in fact i don't think overall that i've been as excited by anything ever in my life i'm in this for the long run and i would be greatly honored and excited if you'll come on this journey with me a magazine i'd recently launched called business two point zero was fatter than a telephone directory busy pumping hot air into the bubble and i was the forty percent owner of a dot com that was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more,1,"this is your conference and I think you have a right to know there's a bit right now in this transition. About this guy who's going to be looking after it for you for a bit so I'm just going to grab a check. nope. 2 years ago a tad. I I think I've come to the conclusion I think I may have been suffering from a strange delusion. I think that I may have believed unconsciously then that. I was kind of a business hero. I I had this company that had spent 15 years building a future magazine publishing company said that it was apparently were two billion dollars and I'm right I didn't really understand. I'm not going to recently launched its Core Business 2.0 was faster than a telephone directory is pumping hot air into the bubble. I'm in an hour I was the 40% owner of a of a dog, it was about to go public and I was a science journalist two people just love that when I said you know I would like to start my own computer magazine. and 15 days later they're at their hundred of them and two thousand people and stuff and it was it was just such heady times. February 2000 graphic my business life but don't look a bit like Moore's Law ever I put into the right. I was in for quite a surprise. date.com ironically course Noble was the very lost consumer web companies go public the next month before NASDAQ exploded and. Brian said 18 months of business how do I so I watched. everything that I had bills crumbling and then I look like all the stuff is going to die and 15 is what would have come for nothing and it was gut-wrenching 88 years of Blood Sweat and Tears to reach 350 employees something which I was very proud of in the business February 2001 in one day we laid off 350 people and before that Bloodshed is finished a thousand people have lost their jobs from for my company. and I'm upset about the million dollars a day everyday for 18 months. and what's in that Van Morrison that you know my sense of self-worth cuz of that Friday I was going around with this big lose that is how the hell did I let my personal happiness get so tied up with this business day. in the end we were able to save future and snowball and you know I was at that point ready to move on and to cut a long story short you know because when I came to the reason why I'm telling the story is that I believe from any conversations that a lot of people in this room have have been through a similar kind of roller coaster emotional roller coaster in the last couple years. this has been a big big transition time and I believe that this conference can play a big pot for one of us and take his forward to the next stage whatever is next. the next year is Reba you know it was two years ago when I reached an agreement on the future of Tad and about the same time and I think partly because of that I started doing something that I'd forgotten about in my business focus and I started to read again. I discovered that one of them busy playing business games that's been this incredible revolution in so many areas of Interest cosmology to psychology to English recycology to Anthropologie to Planet I just changed so much and it was incredibly exciting and what was Rudy most exciting and I think we should have covered this stuff is connected is connected to each other. when does just one example and French president was famous lost Ones what do you most desire and she stood a penis. when you think about it it's very true and I won't we all most desire is happiness or happiness as we say in English.Japanese translation run. but you know something as basic as happiness you know which was 20 years ago we would have been just something for discussion in the in the chat child mosque or synagogue today at 10 my questions that you can even ask about it and which of which way do you think you could ask about what causes it by a place where to donate should not should count seconds. And turns out that the reception tonight is absolutely mine play you can do it at the Computing problem do you need to incorporate some sort of analog of Happiness into a computer Brian to make it what Pro play you can do it at The Institute geopolitical terms and say why is it that a billion people on this planet are so desperately needed that they have no possibility of of Happiness all the rest of them regardless of how. how much money they have it it's $2 a day or whatever or only speak Lee happy on average. will you can you can do it as an evolutionary psychology kind of thing you know why would I bring pastas to make us behave in certain ways our genes and propagate are we the victims of mass delusion these different direction and there's nowhere. garage discovered other than had one you can ask any question that many different directions and so it's it's the profound jokes about to understand you just need to understand a little bit a little bit about everything at the end of the four days you know you want your brain is humming and you feel energized and excited because all these different bits of them put together the total brain experience except it's the mental equivalent of the full body massage every mental Oregon address. enough of the theory Quest tell us what you're actually going to do all right so I will number one do nothing so I ain't going to fix it. I think of Jeff Bezos Kylie Vermont to me that is a really great conference you're going to have to fuck out really badly to me. so can I call myself I get myself to drop class with Ted custom hit head custodian for reason now and I will promise you right here and now that's a cool Valley is that makes had special I'm not going to be interfered with curiosity.. No selling no corporate pochette. nope bandwagoning and I know part 4. Just The Pursuit Of Interest wherever it lies across all the disciplines that are represented here that's not going to be changed at all. number to I am going to put together an incredible lineup for the speakers for next year did The Time Magazine business with monthly deadlines that does a year to do that's no ready I have to show you a bit later than twenty-five or so terrific speakers signed up for next year from the community and combined our contact which pretty much everyone is interesting in the country is not the planet strip. number three I do want to if I can find a way of extending the Ted experience throughout throughout the year to go bad on one key way that this book club books going to save me in the last couple years and. I would like to pass on so when you sign up for a two thousand three every six weeks you'll get a care package with a reason why they linked it had then they will be by at 10 and so we can get the conversation going during the year and come back next year you know haven't had the same intellectual emotional Jenny I think it will I think it will be great and then possibly I want to mention the something Foundation which is the new owner attack what it means is the order of the proceeds will go towards the causes of stopping stands for and more important I think the ideas that. Eric said his head and realized yeah. ideas of the foundation can you use because it's fantastic soon as you know already just the last few days we've had so many people talking about stuff that care about that I passed you about this make a difference in the world and the idea of getting this group of people together some of the causes that we believe in the money that this conference can rise in the ideas I really believe that that combination will of a Time make a difference Incrediplex. in fact I don't think over all that I've been as excited by anything ever in my life I'm in this for the long run. and I would be greatly honored and excited if you'll come on this journey with me. traffic is a global epidemic traffic is creating 45% of a while to air pollution in the UK time wasted in traffic cost 20 billion a year would you place a clean the round of foster commute Stockholm put it to a vote for it. how to do something install come to improve the environment and to get the better of a flow in the traffic will put a price on taking your car into the center part of stock on a cold that congestion charges. if you start the system.

103,ChrisAnderson_2004.sph.wav,about to crash into the trough of disillusionment or rise back in the slope of enlightenment or et cetera and this is one way to do technology forecasting get a sense of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn we tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important we'll typically do it twice once we want to do it first i'd like to speak about technology trends which is something that and that's one way that we try to time technology trends i'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that i call my grand unified theory of predicting the future but it's a petite unified theory of predicting the future it's based on the presumption the observation even for example a critical price line that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world it's an inflection point and these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology 's life is going to be and maybe how you is the critical price the first stage in a technology 's advance is that it'll fall below a critical price will tend if it's successful to rise above a critical mass a penetration and that's another important point and then finally a lot of technologies commoditize towards the end of their life they become nearly free each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it it's an opportunity for the technology to change and even if you missed you know the first boom of wi fi you know wi fi did the critical price it did the critical mass but hasn't done displacement yet and hasn't done free yet there's still more opportunity in that i'd like to demonstrate what i mean by this by telling the story of the dvd which is a technology which has done all of these and it started to take off and you can see that the units started to trend up the hidden inflection point it was taking off the next thing it hit a year later was critical mass in this case twenty percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household and what's interesting here is that something else took off along with it home theater units suddenly you have a dvd in the house you've got high quality digital video you have a reason to have a big screen television you have a reason for dolby five point one surround sound the next phase it hit was displacement you can see around two thousand and one it finally out sold the vcr netflix was right the netflix model could capitalize on the dvd in a way that the video rental stores couldn 't among the dvd 's many assets is that it's very small you can stick it in the mailer has several times in the past year been the number one dvd seller in america their average price for last year was forty eight dollars you're aware of the as they get cheaper the premium brands the sonys and such are losing market share and the no names the apexes are gaining them they're being commodified and that's what happens when things go to zero it's a tough market out there now they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology these four stages of technology 's life i'd like to talk about some other technologies out there just technologies on our radar and i'll use this lens these four as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its development they're not necessarily the top ten technologies out there they're just examples of technologies that are in each one craig venter indeed comes today he may tell you something about this to sequence the human genome for forty million dollars by the end of this year that's as opposed to billions just a few years ago you know our ability to we also like a lot of companies create a product that's based on technology trends in this case ours is about ideas and information and if we're lucky some entertainment there will come a day when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done very cheaply if you want to know you can learn about your own mosaic two thousand the price was ten thousand dollars or twenty seven dollars a day the generics came in first in brazil and elsewhere and the effect was just dramatic on believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by two thousand and five two million in sub saharan africa and the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with but the concept 's quite the same and so we have to understand not only why tech 's important where it's going but also very importantly when see the direction those lines are going you can see that at the twenty percent it's now taken seriously it's not just for the geeks any more that is i imagine what people in redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars i don't know whether anybody has a prius two thousand and four but they're fantastic and if you look at the trends here by about two thousand and eight and i don't think this is a crazy forecast be two percent of auto sales two percent isn't twenty percent but in the car business which is slow moving that's huge that's arrival at two percent you start seeing them on the roads everywhere and what's interesting about the hybrids taking off is you've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry it's the first radical change in automobile technology in one hundred years and once you have electric motors you can do anything you can change the structure of the car in any way you want you can have regenerative braking you can have drive by wire you can have replaceable body shapes it's a little thing that starts with a hybrid but it can lead to a whole new era of the car voice over ip is something you may have heard something about again it's kind of coming out of nowhere it's a little hard to use right now there's a company created by that's critical mass and the same thing 's happening on the carrier side you're looking at ip taking over from some of the traditional telecom the timing is everything this is a tipping point here forgive me look a little bit like that and finally free free is really really interesting free is that comes with digital because the reproduction costs are essentially free it comes with ip and here you have just the number of songs can be stored on a hard drive you know and you've seen the numbers i mean you know the music industry is imploding in front of our very eyes and hollywood's worried as well they're facing a force is draconian about e commerce or internet traffic or broadband adoption or internet advertising and not necessarily the one that's going to get them out of this has a regulated phone system and so did we it was surprisingly non innovative moved very slowly but then so much fiber out there you couldn't hold back and look how quickly the price fell it's seven cents a minute in many cases and the consequence of cheap free phone calling to india is they were all right and any other country that can contact our markets and will work with our companies wrong in time that's why timing is everything you've probably seen something like this before this is the classic gartner hype curve which talks about kind of the trajectory of a technology 's lifespan and just for fun we put a bunch of technologies on it to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak,1,"I'd like to speak about you about technology Trends which is something that many of you follow but we also follow 44 related reasons how do you say sing a technology magazine technology Trends or something that we write about soon and needs to know about but also it's part of being any monthly magazine you live in the future that we have a long lead time we have to plan issues many months in advance we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be 6 months 9 months down the road so we're in the forecast in business. we also like a lot of companies create a product is based on technology Trends in this case ours is about ideas and information and if we're lucky some entertainment but the concept quite the same and so we have to understand not only why I text important where it's going but also very importantly when the timing is everything. and it's interesting when you look at the predictions made during the peak of the Boom in the 1990s about e-commerce or internet traffic a Broadband adoption or Internet advertising they were all right they're just wrong time almost every one of those is coming through just a few years later but the difference of a few years on the stock market valuations it's obviously extreme and that's why timing is everything you probably seen something like this before she's lifespan and just for fun we put a bunch of Technologies on it to show whether it will kind of rising for the first high peak over there about to crash into the the the trough of disillusionment or the right back in the slope and lightning. It's a trend. and this is one way to do technology forecasting get a sense of where technology is and then I anticipate the next upturn we tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important will typically do it twice we want to do it first I want to be the first to do it for the kids to appreciate that will catch it right there at the technology a trigger you can see a 1997 we put Linux on the cover. but then it comes back and sufficiently big Technologies are going to hit the mainstream they're going to burst out and it was time to do it again. last year. and that's one way that we that we we try the time technology Trends I'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that I call my grand unified theory of predicting the future but it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future the observation even that all-important Technologies go through four stages in their life at least one of the one of the four stages sometimes all for the stages of a collision a collision with something else for example a critical Priceline the changes supposed to technology and also changed its effect on the world is inflection point and these are the selection points the tell you what the next chapter in that Technologies life is going to be and maybe how you. can do something about it the first is critical price the first stage and it Technologies Advance is that will fall below a critical price. after Falls below a critical price it will tend to successful to rise above a critical mass penetration. May Technologies and at that point just Place another technology and that's another important point. and it finally a lot of Technologies commoditize toward the end of life they become nearly free each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it cuz the technology to change and you know the first the first move Wi-Fi you know Wi-Fi my Wi-Fi did the critical price at did the critical mass but hasn't done displacement yet and hasn't done free yet it's still more opportunity in that I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this by going to the store selling story of the DVD which the technology which is done all of these in the mid-1990s and it was expensive. you can see that by 1998 and Fallen below $400 and $400 was a psychological thresholds. and it started to take off and you can see that the the units start the trend up hitting inflection point taking off.the next thing is this a year later with critical mass this gets 20 20% is often a good proxy for critical mass and in the household and what's interesting here is that something else took off along with it home theater units suddenly you have DVD in the house you got high-quality digital video you have a reason to have a big screen television you have a reason for Dolby 5.1 surround sound and maybe have a reason for starting to connect them and bring the rest of your entertainment in Netflix in 1999 are they clearly saw that that was a moment that was an inflection point that he could do something with. the next phase it was displacement you can see around us around 2001 it finally have sold the VCR and here too. you can see the applications and then in the World At Large. Netflix is right the other Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD in a way that the the video rental stores couldn't. post to cheaply bat that gave an advantage that was a implication of the Technologies rise that wasn't obvious to everybody. and then finally DVDs are approaching free it's a company called Apex and no name Chinese firm who will times in the past to Europe in the number one DVD seller in America their average price for last year was $48 you're aware of the the Walmart perhaps apocryphal Walmart Stampede over the over the $30 at DVD but that's some you know what they're getting very very cheap and look at the end of it as they get cheaper the premium Brands the Sony is and such are losing market share in the new name is the Apex is Arcanum they're being commodified and that's what happens when things go to zero. it's a it's a tough Market out there. now they're going to do some sport before ways of looking at technology these four stages of Technologies life I'd like to talk about some other Technologies out there I'm just checking out this on our radar and I'll use this Lindsay's for other way to kind of tell you where each one of those Technologies is and it's in its development. I think that the implications of them approaching these cross it was his intersection is interesting to think about Gene sequencing is falling in price at a kind of a Moore's Law like level not possible to will be possible and it scraped centers in and it becomes today he may tell you something about this to sequence a human genome for a 40 million dollars by the end of this year that's supposed to say billions just a few years ago. yeah. Our ability to to capture the tools of creation getting closer and closer. what's interesting is that the same time the number of genes that we're discovering Rising very quickly each one of these genes as potential diagnostic test there is there will come a day when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done dirt cheap way if you want to know. you can learn about your own mosaic. there's another technology that's that's approaching critical price that shows the effect of generic drugs on antiretroviral drug compounds and Cocktails. in January 2000 the price was was was $10,000 or $27 a day the generics came in first in Brazil and elsewhere and and the effect was just 4matic on pricing today it's less than $0.50 a day. and. what's interesting is me to look at the price elasticity if you look at the correlation between these two at the entrance of owls come down the number of people you can't read cuz radically up and the Clinton foundation in Whole30 bacon treats 3 million people worldwide by 2005 to millions of Saharan Africa and the falling Prices rose has a lot to do with that. Linux is another good example with switch the critical mass and red and it's at 20%. interesting that it has it's time to cross over before but not the cross overs that matter the crossover that's going to matter if the one with the blue but you can look to see the direction does lines are going you can see that at the 20% is not taken seriously it's not just for us for the gates anymore. that is imagine what people Redman wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it. another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars I don't know whether anybody has a Prius 2004 with a fantastic and if you look at the trends here by about 2008 and I don't think they'll be 2% of Auto Sales in 20% but in the in the car business which is slow-moving that's huge that's that is that's arrival once you see it what's a 10% you start seeing him on the roads everywhere and what's interesting about about about the hybrids taking off a electric motors to to the automobile industry is the first radical change in the eye in automobile technology in a hundred years I want you at electric motors you can do anything you can change the structure of the car in any way you want you can have regenerative braking you can have drive-by-wire you can have replacement body shapes that's a little thing that starts with a hybrid but it can lead to a whole new era of the car. use right now is a company created by the Kazakh Founders cup Skype look at these numbers they launched in August of last year they already have 4 million nearly four million registered users. that's that critical mass. and it's saying things happening on the carrier side you're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional Telecom standards this is a Tipping Point if not going to forgive me. and it's going to change the economics and the speed and the players in the industry. it's going to look a little bit like that. and finally. free free is really really interesting free is free of something that comes with digital because they reproduction costs are essentially free it comes with with with IP because it's such an efficient protocol it comes with fiber optics because there's so much bandwidth free is is is really your the gift of Silicon Valley to the world it is a I'm if an economic Force it's a technical force it said it's a deflation every Force if not handled right it is abundance as opposed to scarcity free is probably the most interesting thing and I hear you have just a number of stone song for me stored on the hard drive. can be stored on $400 worth of storage by 2008 it takes entire elements the physical element of those songs off the table and you see the numbers I mean you know you are the music industry is imploding and very eyes and Hollywood's worried as well if they're facing a force that they haven't faced before. and the response is Draconian. and not necessarily the other one that's going to get them out of this. I finally give you one last example of free perhaps the most powerful of all I mention fiber optics Inc tends to make things free this is the price of a of a phone call to India per minute what's interesting is that is that was just 1990 when it was more than $2 a minute I'm India had a I had had so has a regulated phone system and and so and so did we it was surprisingly ngoninit Innovative move very slowly but then it was just there was just so much fiber out there he couldn't he couldn't hold back and look how quickly the prices to the Priceville it's $0.07 a minute I'm in many cases and a consequence of cheap phone calling free phone calling to India is. the pissed-off programmer is the Outsourcing it is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization and won the most powerful economic tools that were saying at in our world today the 4th of India and then China and any other any other country that can be reached they can contact our markets and work with our and work with our companies because the communications are free is that just beginning to be felt and I think that's probably the most important technology as friends that were looking at today make it",,
104,ChrisAnderson_2010G.sph.wav,a good friend of ted who just happens to live in africa 's biggest shantytown into a garden the same spot it was a crime spot where people were being robbed they used the same trash to form the same trash site is feeding more than thirty families we have our own film school to record edit and reporting to their own channel kibera tv the sacks to grow vegetables and also able to save on the cost of living change happens when we see things today i see kibera in a different way my message to tedglobal and the entire world is kibera is a hotbed of innovation and chris has always been an inspiring guy what's new and it's huge is that for the first time we get to see him and he can see us right now chris and kevin and dennis and dickson and their friends are watching us in nairobi right now guys we've learned from you today thank you and thank you in essence dancers were challenging each other online to get better incredible new dance skills were being invented even the six year olds were joining in it felt like a revolution and so jon had a brilliant idea he went out to recruit the best of the best dancers off of youtube to this dance troupe the league of extraordinary dancers the lxd these kids were they were so good that they got to play at the and at ted here in february their passion and brilliance just took our breath away this story of the evolution of seems strangely familiar you know a while after tedtalks started taking off we noticed that speakers were starting to spend a lot more time in preparation it was resulting in incredible new talks like these two months of preparation crammed into eighteen minutes raising the bar cruelly for the next generation of speakers with the effects that we've seen this week it's not as if j j and jill actually ended their talks saying step your game up but they might as well have so in both of these cases you've got these cycles of improvement apparently driven by people watching web video what is going on here well i think it's the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call crowd accelerated innovation and there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear you can think of them as three dials on a giant wheel you turn up the dials the wheel starts to and the firs thing you need is a crowd a group of people who share a common interest the bigger the crowd the more potential innovators there are the second thing you need is light you need clear open visibility of what the best people in that crowd are capable of because that is how you will learn how you will be empowered to participate and hard work it's based on hundreds of hours of research of practice absent desire not going to happen now here 's an example pre internet of this machine in action dancers at a street corner it's a crowd a small one but they can all obviously see what each other can do and the desire part comes i guess from social status right best dancer walks tall gets the best date there's probably going to be some innovation happening here but on the web all three dials are ratcheted right up the dance community is now global there's millions connected and amazingly you can still see what the best can do because the crowd itself shines a light on them directly through comments ratings email facebook twitter or indirectly through numbers of views and i'm also a little nervous about this there are nine billion humans coming our way the desire element is really dialed way up i mean you might just be a kid with a webcam but if you can do something that goes viral you get to be seen by the equivalent of sports stadiums crammed with people you get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you and even if it's not that eloquent and it's not it can still really make your day so this possibility of a new type of global recognition i think is driving huge amounts of and it's important to note that it's not just the stars who are benefiting because you can see the best everyone can learn also the system is self fueling it's the crowd that shines the light and fuels the desire but the light and desire are a lethal one two combination that attract new people to the crowd so this is a model any organization could use to try and nurture its own cycle of crowd accelerated innovation invite the crowd let in the light dial up the the most optimistic dreams can get dented by the prospect of people plundering the planet but recently it's by giving away what you think is your deepest secret that maybe millions of people are empowered to help improve it and very happily there's one class of people who really can't make use of this tool the dark side of the web is allergic to the light i don't think we're going to see terrorists for example publishing their plans online and saying to the world please could you help us to actually make them work this time you can publish your stuff online and if you can get that wheel to turn look out so at ted we've become a little obsessed with this idea of openness in fact my colleague june cohen has taken to calling it radical openness because it works for us each time we opened up our talks to the world and suddenly there are millions of people out there helping spread our speakers ideas and thereby making it easier for us to recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers by opening up our translation program thousands of heroic volunteers some of them watching online right now and thank you have translated our talks into more than seventy languages thereby tripling our viewership in non english speaking countries by giving away our tedx brand we suddenly have a thousand plus live experiments in the art of spreading ideas and these organizers they're seeing each other they're learning from each other i've become intrigued by a different way of thinking of large human crowds because there are circumstances where they can do something really cool it's really not news for me to tell you that innovation emerges out of groups you know we've heard that this week this romantic notion of the lone genius with the eureka moment that changes the world is misleading even he said that and he would a social species we spark off each other it's also not news to say that the internet has accelerated innovation for the past fifteen years powerful communities have been connecting online sparking off each other if you take programmers you know the whole open source movement is a fantastic instance of crowd accelerated innovation what's key here is the reason these groups have been able to connect is because their work output is of the type that can be easily shared digitally a picture a music file software and that's why what i'm excited about and what i think is under reported is the significance of the rise of online video this is the technology that's going to allow the rest of the world 's talents to be shared digitally thereby launching a whole new cycle of crowd accelerated innovation the first it's a phenomenon that i think any organization or individual can tap into it certainly impacted the way we think about ted 's future and perhaps the world 's future overall few years of the web were pretty much video free for this reason video files are huge the web couldn't handle them but in the last ten years cisco actually estimates that within four years more than ninety percent of the web 's data will be video if it's all puppies porn and piracy we're doomed i don't think it will be video is high bandwidth for a reason it packs a huge amount of data and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it here let me introduce you to sam haber looking at video clips posted by strangers a world of possibility opens up for him suddenly he starts to emulate and then to innovate and a global community of unicyclists discover each other online inspire each other to greatness and there are thousands of other examples of this happening of video driven evolution of skills ranging from the physical to the and i have to tell you as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines i find this strangely beautiful i mean there's a lot of passion right here on this screen but if rube goldberg machines and video poetry aren't quite your cup of tea how about this jove is a website that was founded to encourage scientists to publish their peer reviewed research on video so let 's explore the story starts with just a single person a child behaving a little strangely this if you can show instead of just describing that problem goes away so it's not far fetched to say that at some point online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance here 's another example that's close to our hearts at ted where video is sometimes more powerful than print the sharing of an idea why do people like watching all those ideas are already out there in print it's actually faster to read than to view why would someone bother well so there's some showing as well as telling but even leaving the screen out of it there's still a lot more being transferred than just words and in that non verbal portion there's some serious magic somewhere hidden in the physical gestures the vocal cadence the facial expressions the eye contact the passion the kind of awkward british body language the sense of how the audience are reacting there are hundreds of subconscious clues that go to how well you will understand and whether you're inspired light if you like and desire incredibly all of this can be communicated on just a few square inches of a screen this is the connective tissue of the human superorganism in action it's probably driven our culture for millennia five hundred years ago it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage but now in the blink of an eye the game has changed again it's not too much to say that what gutenberg did for writing that just went global now this is big we may have to reinvent an ancient art form i mean today one person speaking can be seen by millions how did he learn them and what drove him to spend the hundreds of hours of practice this must shedding bright light on potent ideas creating intense desire for learning and to respond and in his case intense desire to for the first time in human history talented students don't have to have their potential and their dreams written out of history by lousy teachers they can sit two feet in front of the world 's finest now ted is just a small part of this i mean the world 's universities are opening up their curricula thousands of individuals and organizations are sharing their knowledge and data online so we're dreaming of ways to make it easier for you the global ted community to respond to speakers to contribute your own ideas maybe even your own and to help shine a light on the very best of what's out there because if we can bubble up the very best from a vastly larger pool this wheel turns now is it possible to imagine a similar process to this happening to global education overall have to be this painful top down process why not a self fueling cycle in which we all can participate it's the participation age right schools can't be silos we can't stop learning at age twenty one what if in the coming crowd of nine billion what if that crowd could learn enough to be net contributors instead of net plunderers that changes everything right i mean that would take more teachers than we've ever had but the good news is they are out there teacher teacher part of the crowd that may be about to launch the biggest learning cycle in human history a cycle capable of carrying all of us to a smarter wiser more beautiful place so that was sent to me by this of kids in a village in pakistan near where i grew up within five years each of these kids is going to have access to a cellphone capable of full on web video it crazy to think that this girl in the back at the right in fifteen years might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful for your grandchildren it's not crazy it's actually happening right now,1,"I'll be out at least I've discovered what it is we put our speakers through sleepless nights a wholly unnatural fear of clocks I mean it's a little nervous about this. there are nine billion humans coming our way. the most optimistic dreams can get dented by the prospect of people planting the planet. I think I'm intrigued by a different way of thinking of large human crowd really cool it's a phenomenon that organization or individual can tap into its Bentley impacted what we think about Ted suits show about the world's future overall a child behaving strangely. little demon strikes the puppy nose six-year-old in history ever managed before how did he learn them hundreds of hours of practice this must have taken. Spider-Man step your game up to that was the internet was causing dance to evolve. what he said at 10 in February. dances with challenging each other online to get basa incredible new don't skills would be invented even the six year olds are joining in it felt like a revolution had a brilliant idea. he went out to recruit the best of the best dances off of YouTube to create this dance troupe the League of Extraordinary dancers the lxt but they were so good they got to play the Oscars this year and in February that passion and Brilliance just took my breath away. this story of The Evolution of Dance seems strangely familiar started taking off and preparation preparation crammed into 18 minutes raising the bar truly for the next generation of because of the effects of this week until actually ended that talk saying step your game up but they might as well as the cycles of improvement. Driven by people watching Web video what is going on here. what's a good place to raijin Ramen and we can call crowd accelerated innovation. there's a three things you need for this thing's kicking to yeah you can think of them is sweet dials on a giant will you turn up the dials the wheel stopped and the first thing you need is a crowd group of people who share a common interest to pick up the crowd the more potential innovators they're all that's important that creating the ecosystem from a generation images. the second thing you need is light you need clear open visibility about the best people in that crowd a capable of because that is how you will learn how he will be empowered to participate and that any desire of research practice absent desire not going to happen now kiss an example of the internet of this machine and action dances at a street corner with the crowd small one but they can see what he can do and this is the best dog for a walk stole gets the best days that's probably going to be some Innovation Happening Here. on the web all three dials arrested right up the dump Community is not Global that's Millions connected and amazingly you can still see what the best can do if a crowded self shines a light on them directly through email Facebook Twitter through numbers of you two links to point Google that it's easy to find the good stuff when you found that you can watch it in cuz up repeatedly and read what hundreds of people have written about it.. the designer element is really you know.. I mean you might just be a kid with a webcam but if you can do something that goes viral you get to be seen by the equivalence of sports stadiums crammed with people you get hundreds of strangers writing excited about you but even if it's not that eloquent and it's not you can still really make your day. this possibility of a new type of global recognition. I think it's driving huge amounts of Elsa and it's important to note that it's not just the stars who have benefiting because you can see the best everyone can learn also the system is still Fuel and it's the crowd that shines the light and feel the desire for the lightning desire and Alyssa 12 combination that attract new people to the crowd this is a modal any organization could use try not to its own cycle of crowd accelerate Innovation invite the crowd lessen the lights. The design. the hardest part about that is probably the light does it mean to have to open up that you have to show your stuff to the world. by giving away what you think is your deepest secret the Mega Millions of people run power to help improve it and very happily that's one class of people who really count make use of this to have the dark side of the web is allergic to the light I don't think we're going to see terrorists for example publishing that plans online and sayings about please can you help us try to make them work this time but you can publish of stuff online and if you can get that we can look out. so we've become obsessed inside you have open this. My calling Jim Khan's take me to call radical open this time we open up and talk to the Wild and sunny there are millions of people out there helping spread our speakers ideas and thereby making it easier for us to recruit and motivate the Next Generation speakers if I open a translation program thousands of volunteers some of them watching online right now and thank you have translated into more than 70 language is by giving away our tedx brand we suddenly have a thousand plus live experiments in the artist painting ideas. that's seeing each other that learning from each other we are learning from them we're getting great talks back from them the wheel is turning. set back a minute it's not news Mesa tell you that Innovation and I just heard that this week this romantic notion of the lone genius for the Eureka moment that changes the world is misleading even he said that and you would not. where are social fishes we spoke of each other. it's also not news to say that the internet has accelerated Innovation powerful communities have been in an open-source movement of the Fantastic instant of product Innovation what key here is the reason these groups have been able to connect output is it the type that can be easily shared digitally a picture music file. that's why you know what I'm excited about what I think is under-reported is the significance of the rise of online video this is the technology. listen to allow the rest of the world talents which I did was lay there by launching a whole new cycle of product innovation. the first two years of the web video free for this reason video files a huge weapon handle them but the last ten years has exploded a hundredfold Sunday here we are Humanity what is 80 million hours of YouTube every day. it's all puppies pulling in piracy but doomed. I don't think it will be a video is high Bandit for a reason it packs a huge amount of data and I'll bring that uniquely wired to decode it here let me introduce you to sign hayba. there's no way I can just discover his Sports to potential cuz he communicate this stuff in what's right. looking up video clips posted by strange has a world of possibilities opens up for him. Send your light and set the brightness thousands of other examples of this happening a video driven evolution of scales ranging from the physical to The Artful and I have to tell you but the former publisher of hobbyists magazines I find this Strangely Beautiful Minnesota passion right here on the screen. but if Rube Goldberg machines and video talk to you like a cup of tea how about this. jove is a website that was founded to encourage scientists to publish that. You'd research on video does it part of the traditional scientific paper you can take months for scientist to figure out how to replicate the experiment is one such for the donuts on this but look at this video. if you can show just describing that problem goes away so it's not far-fetched to say that at some point. online video is in a dramatically accelerate scientific advance. here's another example that's close to a heart attack video is sometimes more powerful then print the sharing of an idea. why do people like watching TED Talks ideas already out there and print actually Foster to read them to be wanted some of that well but even leaving the screen out of it. the cinema being transferred in this world isn't that number of apportion doesn't serious magic somewhere hidden in the physical gestures the vocal Cadence the facial expressions eye contact. passion British body language and whether you were inspired light if you like and desire. what are the communication on just a few square inches of a screen. Reading Writing right should be relatively recent inventions face-to-face communication has been fine-tuned by millions of years of evolution that's what's made it into this mysterious powerful thing it is his residence in all these receiving grains the whole group apps together I mean this is the connective tissue of the human superorganism in action in Millennia it run into a competitive with the lethal Advantage print scales. 12 time fishing innovators influences now to get their ideas to spread far and wide and set it on the vine. but now in the blink of an eye the game has changed again. it's not too much to say that what Gutenberg did the right thing. online video cannot do for face-to-face communication so that which your brain is exquisitely with high for Global. that's a big we may have to reinvent an ancient art form today one person speaking can be seen by millions. shedding bright light on potent ideas creating intense desire for learning to respond and his case intense desire. first time in human history talented students don't have to have the potential in that dreams written out of History by lousy teachers they can sit two feet in front of the World Finance. now that is just a small part of this I mean the world's universities are opening up that curricula thousands of individuals and organisations sharing that knowledge and data online thousands of people to figure out new ways to learn and crucially to respond completing the cycle until about this has become clear to us what the next stage of Ted's Eeveelution has to be a one-way process of future is many-to-many. David dreaming of ways to make it easier for you the global Community to respond to speakers to contribute your own ideas maybe even your own Ted Talk on the light on the very best of what doubt that if we can bump up the very best from a busted aaja pull this will turn now is it possible to imagine some of the process to this happening to Global education overall. does it have to be this painful top-down process what why not a self-healing cycling which we all can participate schools, sylas we can't stop learning age 21. what if in the coming crowd 9 billion. what is that crowd could learn enough to be net contributors instead of net plum dress. that changes everything right. that would take more teachers and we've ever had the penny says they are out there doing the proud and the crowd is switching on lights so we can see them for the first time not that I'm differentiated massive strangers but as individuals we can learn from. who's the teacher. you're the teacher. you're part of the crowd that may be about to launch the biggest learning cycle in human history cycle capable of carrying all of us to a smarter wiser more beautiful place. is it are the kids in a village in Pakistan near where I grew up crazy to think that this girl on the back of the right in 15 years might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful field grandchildren. it's not crazy it's actually happening right now want to introduce you to a good friend of Ted you just happens to live in Africa's biggest shanty town. hi my name is Crystal from Macau I'm running to connect your so many good things with your opinion writing to be a self-help group that turn into a garden Sports it was a crime sportswear by people are being home that uses the same trust to foam green manual the Central site is 50 more than thirty families we have our own in school they're using to live cameras to record edit and reporting to their own channel to be the TV go do stuff with your plans where you seen the socks to grow vegetables and also able to save on the cost of living when we see things in a different way. today I think your Betta in a different way my message to Ted Global and the entire world is Kavita is a hotbed of innovation and ideas. you know what. I think Chris has always been an inspiring Guy what's new and it's huge is it for the first time we get to see him and he can see us right now Chris and Kevin and Dennis and Dixon and that friends are watching us in Nairobi right now guys we've learned from you today thank you and thank you",,
105,ChrisJordan_2008.sph.wav,now that number is dwarfed by the number of paper cups we use every day and that is forty million cups a day for hot beverages most of which is coffee i couldn't fit forty million cups on a canvas but i was able to put four hundred and ten thousand is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously on a collective level speaking of justice there's another phenomenon going on in our culture that i find deeply troubling and that is that america right now has the largest percentage of its population in prison of any country on earth one out of four people one out of four humans in prison are americans imprisoned in our country and i wanted to show the number the number is two point three million americans were incarcerated in two thousand and five and that's gone up since then but we don't have the numbers yet so i wanted to show two point three million prison uniforms and in the actual print of this piece each uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge they're tiny they're barely visible as a piece of material and to show two point three million of them required a canvas that was larger than any printer in the world would print and so i had to divide it up into multiple panels that are ten feet tall by twenty five feet wide and what i mean by that it's the behaviors that we're in denial about and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness more than four hundred thousand people die in the united states every year from smoking cigarettes and so this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes and as you slowly step back you see that it's a painting by van gogh called skull with cigarette it's a strange thing to think about that on nine eleven when that tragedy happened three thousand americans died and do you remember the response it reverberated around the world the tobacco lobby it's too strong we just dismiss it out of our consciousness and knowing what we know about the destructive power of cigarettes we continue to allow our children our sons and daughters to be in the presence of the influences that start them smoking and this is what the next piece is about this is just lots and lots of cigarettes sixty five thousand cigarettes which is equal to the number of teenagers and as individuals we all do these things all the time everyday it's like when you're mean to your wife because you're mad at somebody else who will start smoking this month and every month in the us more than seven hundred thousand children in the united states aged eighteen and under begin smoking every year one more strange epidemic in the united states that i want to acquaint you with is this phenomenon of abuse and misuse of prescription drugs this is an image i've made out of lots and lots of vicodin well actually i only had one vicodin that i scanned lots and lots of times and so as you stand back you see two hundred and thirteen thousand vicodin pills which is the number of hospital emergency room visits yearly in the united states attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers and anti anxiety medications one third of all drug overdoses in the u s and that includes cocaine heroin alcohol everything one third of drug overdoses are prescription medications this is a piece that i just recently completed about another tragic phenomenon and that is the phenomenon this growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery three hundred and eighty four thousand women american women last year for elective breast augmentation surgery given to young girls who are about to go off to college so i made this image out of barbie dolls and so as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern and as you get all the way back you see thirty two thousand barbie dolls which represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries that are performed in the u s each month the vast majority of those are on women under the age of twenty one and strangely enough the only plastic surgery that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction and most of that is being done by men or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt or whatever and have this fear that we aren't feeling enough as a culture right now this kind of anesthesia in america at the moment and our grief about what's going on in our culture right now what's going on in our country the atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world they've gone missing these feelings have gone missing our cultural joy our national joy is nowhere to be seen and one of the causes of this i think is that as each of us attempts to build this new kind of world view this this holographic image that we're all trying to create in our mind of the inter connection of things the environmental footprints one thousand miles away of the things that we buy the social consequences when we do these kind of things when three hundred million people do unconscious behaviors then it can add up to a catastrophic consequence that nobody wants and no one intended and that's what i look at with my photographic work ten thousand miles away of the daily decisions that we make as consumers as we try to build this view and try to educate ourselves about the enormity of our culture the information that we have to work with is these gigantic numbers bush 's new budget is in the trillions and these are numbers that our brain just doesn't have the ability to comprehend we can't make meaning out of these enormous statistics more than they do now if we can find that then we'll be able to find within each one of us what it is that we need to find to face the big question which is how do we change that to me is the big question that we face as a people right now how do we change how do we change as a culture each individually take responsibility for the one piece of the solution that we are in charge is that you don't have to make yourself to look at these issues not pointing the finger at america in a blaming way i'm simply saying this is who we are right now if there are things that we see that we don't like about our culture then we have a choice the degree of integrity that each of us can bring to the surface to bring to this question as we show up for the question of how do we change it's already defining us and it will profoundly affect the well being the quality of life of the billions of people i'm not speaking abstractly about this this is who we are in this room right now in this moment thank and as you get a little bit closer it starts looking like lots of pipes like maybe a and in fact this is one million plastic cups which is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights in the united states every six hours we use four million cups a day on airline flights and virtually none of them are reused or recycled they just don't do that in that industry,1,"my work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously on a collective level. and what I mean by that it's the behaviors that were in denial about and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness and as individuals we all do these things all the time everyday it's like when you mean to your wife because you're mad at somebody else or when you drink a little too much at a party just out of anxiety or when you over eat because your feelings are hurt or whatever and. when we do these kind of things with 300 million people do unconscious behaviors then you can add up to a catastrophic consequences nobody wants and no one intended and that's what I look at with my photographic work. this is an image I just recently completed that is when you stand back at a distance it looks like some kind of Neo Gothic cartoon image of a factory spewing out pollution and as we get a little bit closer it starts looking like lots of pipes like maybe a chemical plant or a Refinery or maybe a hellish freeway interchange and is it all the way up close you realized it's actually made of lots and lots of plastic cups and in fact is 1 million plastic cups which is even number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights in the United States every 6 hours which is 4 million cups a day on airline flights and virtually none of them are reused or recycled it just don't do that in that industry. now that number is dwarfed by the number of paper cups we use everyday and that is 40 million cups a day for hot beverages most of which is coffee I couldn't fit 40 million cups on a canvas but I was able to put 410,000 not sweat 410000 cups looks like that's 15 minutes of our cup consumption and if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life that's the size it would be and there's an hour's worth of our cups and there's a day's worth of her cups you still see the little people way down there that's as high as of 42 story building and I put the Statue of Liberty in there as a scale reference. speaking of Justice there's another phenomenon going on in our culture that I find deeply troubling and that is it America right now has the largest percentage of its population in prison of any country on Earth. one out of four people one out of four humans in prison are Americans in prison in our country. and I wanted to show the number the number is 2.3 million Americans were incarcerated in 2005 and that's gone up since then but we don't have the numbers yet so I wanted to show 2.3 million prison uniforms and an actual print of this piece each uniform is the size of a nickel on its Edge they're tiny they're barely visible as a piece of material and to show 2.3 million of them required a canvas it was larger than any printer in the world would print it so I had to divide it up into multiple panels that are 10 ft tall by 25 ft wide. this is that piece installed in a gallery in New York those are my parents looking at the peace. every time you look at this this piece I was wondering if my moms with me to my dad he finally fold his laundry. I want to show you some pieces now that are about addiction and this particular one is about cigarette addiction I wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of Americans who died from cigarette smoking more than 400,000 people die in the United States every year from smoking cigarettes and so this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes and is he slowly step back you see that is a painting by Van Gogh called skull with cigarette. it's a strange thing to think about it on 9/11 when the tragedy happened 3,000 Americans died and remember the response it reverberated around the world and will continue to reverberate through time he'll be something that we talked about in 100 years and on that same day 11 hundred Americans died from smoking and the day after that another 1,100 Americans died from smoking in every single day since then 11:00 Americans have died and today 11:00 Miracles are dying from cigarette smoking and we aren't talking about it. we dismiss it. the tobacco Lobby it's too strong we just dismiss it out of our consciousness. and knowing what we know about the destructive power of of cigarettes we continue to allow our children are our sons and daughters to be in the presence of the influences that start them smoking and this is what the next pieces about this is just lots and lots of cigarettes 65,000 cigarettes which is equal to the number of teenagers who will start smoking this month and every month in the u.s. what is 700000 children in the United States aged 18 and under begin smoking every year. when were strange epidemic in the United States that that I want to acquaint you with is this this phenomenon of abuse and misuse of prescription drugs. this isn't even just made out of lots and lots of Vicodin will actually only have one Vicodin that I scanned lots and lots of times and so as you stand a Q-See 213000 Vicodin pill which is the number of Hospital emergency room visits yearly in the United States attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers and anti-anxiety medications one-third of all drug overdoses in the you ask many poops cocaine heroin alcohol everything one-third of drug overdoses are prescription medications. strange phenomena. this is a piece that I just recently completed about another tragic phenomenon and that is the phenomenon this is this growing Obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery. 384000 women American women last year went in for breast for elective breast augmentation surgery. it's rapidly becoming the most popular high school graduation gift given to young girls are about to go off to college. so I made this image out of Barbie dolls and so as he stand back you see this kind of floral pattern is it all the way back you see 32,000 Barbie dolls which represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries are performed in the US each month. the vast majority of those are on women under the age of 21 and strangely enough the only plastic surgery that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction and most of that has been done by man. no I want a size that these are just two examples I'm not holding these out as being the biggest issues they're just examples and the reason that I do this it's because I have this fear that we aren't feeling enough as a culture right now they're just kind of anesthesia in America at the moment. we've we've lost our sense of outrage. or anger. in our grief about what's going on in our culture right now what's going on in our country the atrocities are being committed our names around the world they've gone missing these feelings are gone missing or cultural July our national Joy is nowhere to be seen. and one of the causes of this I think is it as each of us attempts to build this new kind of of of worldview is whole Optical worldview is holographic image that we're all trying to create in our mind of the interconnection of things the environmental Footprints a thousand miles away of the things that we buy but it's social consequences Ten Thousand Miles Away of the daily decisions that we make its consumers as we try to build this View and try to educate ourselves about the enormity of our culture. the information we have to work with is the gigantic numbers things in numbers in the millions in the hundreds of millions in the billions and now the trillions bushes new budget in the trillions I need your numbers that with our brain just doesn't have the ability to comprehend we can't make meaning out of these enormous statistics. and so that's what I'm trying to do with my work is to take these numbers the statistics from the raw language of data and a translate them into a more Universal visual language that can be felt. because my belief is if we can feel these issues if we can feel these things more deeply then no matter to us more than they do now. if we can find that then we'll be able to find within each one of us what it is that we need to find to hit to face the big question which is how do we change that to me is the big question that we face as a as a people right now is how do we change how do we change the culture. how do we each individually take responsibility for the one piece of the solution that we are in charge of our own behavior. my belief is that you don't have to make yourself bad to look at these issues. I'm not pointing the finger at America in a blaming way I'm simply saying this is who we are right now and if there's things that we see that we don't like about our culture then we have a choice.the degree of Integrity but each of us can can bring to the surface to bring to this question. the depth of character do we can summon. as we show up for the question of how do we change. it's already defining us as individuals. and as a nation. and it will continue to do that on into the future. and it will professionally effect. the well-being the quality of life of the billions of people who are going to inherit the results of our decisions. I'm not speaking abstractly about this. I'm speaking this is who we are in this room. right now in this moment. thank you and good afternoon",,
106,ChristienMeindertsma_2010G.sph.wav,well basically it's a product catalog of this one pig and it carries a duplicate of his ear tag on the back and it consists of seven chapters the chapters are skin bones meat internal organs blood fat and miscellaneous in total they weigh one hundred and three point seven kilograms and to show you how often you actually meet part of this pig in a regular day i want to show you some images of the book you probably start the day with a shower so in soap fatty acids made from boiling pork bone fat are used as a hardening agent but also for giving it a pearl like if you look around you in the bathroom you see lots more products like shampoo conditioner anti wrinkle cream body lotion but also toothpaste then so before breakfast you've already met the pig so many times then at breakfast the pig that followed the hairs off the pig or proteins from the hairs off the pig were used as an improver of dough i would like to start my talk with actually two questions and the first one is how many people here actually eat pig meat well when you're off to work under the road or under the buildings that you see there might very well be cellular concrete which is a very light kind of concrete that's actually got proteins from bones inside and it's also fully reusable in the train brakes at least in the german train brakes there's this part of the brake that's made of bone ash and in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts like chocolate mousse tiramisu vanilla pudding everything that's cooled in the supermarket there's gelatin to make it look good fine bone china this is a real classic of course the bone in fine bone china gives it its translucency and also its strength in order to make these really fine shapes like this used in paint for the texture but also for the glossiness in sandpaper bone glue is actually the glue between the sand and the paper and then in paintbrushes hairs are used because apparently they're very suitable for making paintbrushes because of their hard wearing nature i was not planning on showing you any meat because of course half the book 's meat and you probably all know what meats they are but i didn't want you to miss out on this one because this well it's called portion controlled meat cuts and this is actually sold in the frozen area of the supermarket and what it is it's actually steak so this is sort of cow but what happens when you slaughter a cow at least in industrial factory farming and how many people have actually seen a live pig producing this meat they have all these little bits of steak left that they can't actually sell as steak so what they do is they glue them all together with fibrin from pig blood into this really large sausage freeze the sausage cut it in little slices and sell those as steak again and this also actually happens with tuna and scallops so with the steak you might drink a beer in the brewing process there's lots of cloudy elements in the beer so to get rid of these cloudy elements what some companies do is they pour the beer through a kind of gelatin sieve in order to get rid of this actually also goes for wine as well as actually a company in greece that produces these cigarettes that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter and according to them this creates an artificial lung in the filter so this is actually a healthier cigarette this must be the strangest thing i found this is a coming from a very large ammunition company in the united states and while i was making the book i contacted all the producers of products come from you actually never see a pig which is really strange because on a population of sixteen million people we have twelve million pigs because i wanted them to send me the real samples and the real specimens so i sent this company an email saying hello i'm christien i'm doing this research and i thought that was really weird as if the dutch government sends emails to anyone so the most beautiful thing i found at least what i think is the most beautiful in the book is this heart valve it's actually a very low tech and very high tech product at the same time the low tech bit is that it's literally a pig 's heart valve mounted in the high tech bit which is a memory metal casing and what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart without open heart surgery and once it's in the right spot they remove the outer shell and the heart well it gets this shape and at that moment it starts beating instantly it's really a sort of magical moment so this is actually a dutch company so i called them up and i asked can i borrow a heart valve from you and the really enthusiastic so they were like okay we'll put it in a jar for you with formalin and you can borrow it great and then i didn't hear from them for weeks so and well of course the dutch can't eat all these pigs they eat about one third and the rest is exported to all kinds of countries in europe and the rest of the world a lot goes to the u k germany i called and i asked what 's going on with the heart valve and they said well the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart valve because want his product to be associated with the last product from the book that i'm showing you is renewable energy actually to show that my first question if pigs are still used up until the last bit was still true well it is because everything that can't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source i found one hundred and eighty five products and what they showed me is that well firstly that we don't treat these pigs as absolute kings and queens and the second is that we actually don't have a clue of what all these products that surround us are made of and you might think i'm very fond of pigs but actually well i am a little bit but i'm more fond of raw materials in general and i think that and what i was curious about because historically the whole pig would be used up until the last bit so nothing would be wasted and i was curious to find out if this was actually still the case and i spent about three years researching and i followed this one pig with number five thousand and forty nine all the way up until the end and to what products it's made of and in these years i met all kinds people like for instance farmers and butchers which seems logical but i also met aluminum mold makers ammunition producers and all kinds of people and what was striking to me is that the farmers actually had no clue what was made of their pigs but the consumers as in us had also no idea of the pigs being in all these products so what i did is i took all this research and i made it into a,1,hello I would like to start my talk with actually two questions in the first one is how many people here actually eat pig meets these regiments. oh that's about how many people have actually seen a live Pig producing this mean in the last year. in the Netherlands where I come from your ass ain't never see a pic which is really strange because on the population of 16 million people we have twelve million pigs and fix that either but one side and the rest is exported to what kind of countries in Europe and the rest of the world's about to go to the UK Germany and what I was curious about the hold up until the last bit so nothing would be wasted and I was curious to find out if this was actually still the case and I spent about three years researching and I followed this one paid with number 05749 / way up until the end and to what product is made of and initiates I met all kinds of people like Francis old makers and ammunition producers and all kinds of people and butt. consumers in us had no idea of the pigs being in all these products so what I did is I took all this research and I made it into a catalog of this one page and it carries a duplicate of your tag on the back and the blood fat and miscellaneous. and so total 103.7 kg and to show you how often you actually meet part of this big in a regular day and want to show you some images of the book. you probably start the day with a shower so in so fatty acids made from boiling pork bone fat are used as a hardening Asian but also for giving it up real life affect then if you look around you in the bathroom you see lots more products like shampoo conditioner anti-wrinkle cream and body lotion with toothpaste to fix her many times. breakfast the pic that I followed the hairs of the pigs are proteins from the hatch of the pig or used as an improver of do. that's what the producer says it's Improvement in low-fat no-fat products when you take the fat out to actually take the taste and a texturizer what they do is they put gelatin back in in order to retain the texture. well I have to work under the road or under the buildings that you see that might very well be studied at concrete which is a very nice kind of concrete that's actually got proteins from bones inside and it's also fully reusable in the train brakes at least in the German train wrecks there is part of the break that she made of bone Ash. and then she's taking all kinds of desserts like chocolate mousse tiramisu vanilla fighting everything that's cool in the supermarket there's gelatine to make it look good. fine bone china this is a real classic cause the bone in fine bone china gives it its translucency and also its strength in order to make these really fine shapes like this day. in Syria decorating the fix actually quite that it's used in paint for the texture of it also for the closing is incense pay for bone glue is actually the glue between the sand in the paper. and then paint brushes has a used because apparently they're very suitable for making paint brushes because if they Hardware enature. I was not planning on showing you any Meats because schools have the books meats and you probably will know what meats they are but I didn't want you to miss out on this one because this what schools portion-controlled me Scott's and recently sold in the Frozen area of the supermarket and what it is it's actually steak so this is so this cow but what happens when you slow to recover listen the industrial Factory for me they have all these little bits of steak left that they found Ashley fell asleep so what they do is they glue them all together with fibrin from Big Lots into this really large sausage then freeze the sausage got a little slices and sell those aspects and actually happens with tuna and scallops. so with the steak you might drink a beer in the Brewing process there's lots of Cloudy elements in the vso to get rid of these cloudy elements what some companies do you say for the beer through a sort of gelatin safe in order to get rid of nausea cloudiness. that's actually a company in Greece that produces these cigarettes that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter and according to them this creates an artificial lung in the filter. so this is actually a healthier cigarette. injectable collagen or since the 70s collagen from pigs has been used for injecting into wrinkles and the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to you and being so the collagen is as well. but this must be the strangest thing I found this is a bullet coming from a very large lamination company in the United States and time while I was making the book I contacted all the producers of product because I wanted them to send me the real sound. The real specimens so I sent an email saying I didn't expect him to even answer my answer then they said was thank you for your email I thought I was really worried as if the Dutch government sent emails do I have. so the most beautiful thing I found at least what I think is the most beautiful in the book is that this heartfelt it's actually a very low-tech and very high-tech products at the same time the low-tech bit it. It's literally a big charge shelf mounted in the high-tech B which is a Memory Metal casing and what happens if this can be implanted into a human heart without open-heart surgery and once it in the right spot they remove the outer shell and the heartfelt well if it gets this shape and at that moment it starts beating instantly it's really sort of magical moment company so I'm going to ask can I borrow a car from you and the the makers of this thing really enthusiastic and then I didn't hear from them for 4 weeks so I called I called and I asked what's what's going on with a heartfelt and then they said. he doesn't want this project to be associated with pigs. The Last Remnant from the book that I'm sure use renewable energy actually to show that my first question is if eggs are still used up until the last bit was still true while it is because everything that can be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as a renewable energy source its products and firstly it's at least it's a old that we don't treat these pigs and Stripes flute kings and queens and the second is that we actually don't have a clue of what are made of and you might think I'm very fond of pigs but actually I am a little bit but I'm more fond of of raw materials in general and I think that in order to take better care of what's behind our products so the livestock the crops the plants and the non renewable materials for the people that produced the first step. need to know that bad there. thank you very much. the position of a watch is a function of its movement for lx420 stove to guarantee the Precision of a timepiece the pressing question was how to protect the movement itself the elements with the creation of the first waterproof Fitbit watch. the Rolex Oyster was born over the years I feel changes in the design continue to improve the oyster adding more Comfort while keeping the style contemporary along with style more functions have been added a Rolex wrist watch with the first to show the dates for small aperture on the face it was also the first wristwatch to spend the week info launched in 1953 the Submariner with the first Rolex watch. already on an incredible journey of innovation and design Rolex decided to push the boundaries even further in 1960 that made history the submersible 6850 a Rolex deepsea special with strap to the exploration let's have lunch in in 1967. the Submariner is redesigns and the case features of you you need directional rotatable bezel what is Sarah Chrome disc. it is with the paintings at the Rolex deepsea safely descend to 12800 feet.

107,ChristopherDeam_2002.sph.wav,the interiors were completely out of sync with that in fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin that seemed really like a crisis to me that they had never been able to we really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic in an airstream trailer and what feels like it has true purpose and utility we stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint i was asked by wilsonart international a plastic laminate company which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world they asked me to that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell we took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing i literally drew on the walls of the trailer mocked it up in cardboard we'd come in and cut decide things were wrong pull it out put it back in the main goal was to smooth out the interior and begin to speak about motion and mobility and independence the biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you're designing there's actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer there's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together where you can change curve interior what i had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell what i came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell and what i was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way and that the casework break up the space they also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin so they function as an electrical chase that's the trailer pretty much finished that trailer led to another commission to participate in whats called tokyo designers block its a week of furniture design events in tokyo in october design a trade show booth for exhibition at the international contemporary furniture fair in new york in two thousand teruo kurosaki who owns a furniture company called idee he asked me he said one he would like to make a real trailer functioning and we would sell that one trailer number two you have a blank slate you can to anything you want we came up with a fantasy scenario dj traveling around the states that would collect records and go on tours this trailer housed two turntables mixer wet bar it's got a huge couch fits quite a few people and basically we'd had a great time with this and so in this trailer i took it upon myself to think about this brings us up to the time that i started consulting to airstream they came to me and said well what can we do to freshen this thing do you think kids you know skateboarders surfers rock climbers would use these things and i said well not in that interior i thought finally oh yeah great big company i'm gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding and i walked in their prototype facility and it's exactly like my shop only bigger same tools same things so the problem became and they set this dilemma to me that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology and there's no money for tooling or molding the trailers themselves are actually hand built all the casework is hand scribed in uniquely so you can't just cut so looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design interiors and furniture you have to cut them big and every single one is hand fit they didn't want to go to a componentized system and there it is that's the bambi sixteen we came up with the solution of taking an old airstream trailer and gutting it and trying to portray laminate and a trailer in kind of a fresh new contemporary look when this trailer showed up at my shop in berkeley i'd actually never stepped foot in an airstream trailer or any other trailer so i can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if i can optimize it in its most idealistic fashion i decided i had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of airstream what i discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces in that the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight modern futuristic high tech pod for hurtling down the freeway,1,I was asked by Wilsonart International plastic laminate company which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world and they asked me to design a trade show booth for Exhibition at the international Contemporary Furniture fair in New York in two thousand and so looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically Transportation design interiors and Furniture we came up with a solution of taking an old Airstream trailer and gutting it in trying to portray laminate and a trailer and kind of a fresh new contemporary look when this trailer showed up at my shop in Berkeley I'd actually never stepped foot in an Airstream trailer or any other trailer so I can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if I can optimize it and it. most idealistic fashion I decided I had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of Airstream in what I discovered in these Interiors is that there's a disconnect between the exterior shell in the interior architecture of the pieces in debt the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight modern futuristic high-tech pod for curdling down the freeway and the Interiors were completely out of sync with that in in fact it appeared like they reference the mountain cabin. Seem really like a crisis to me that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about Escape in about traveling modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell so we really needed to do some archaeology in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic in an Airstream trailer and what feels like it has. purpose and utility we stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell we took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the Country Cabin thing I literally Drew on the walls of the trailer mocked it up and cardboard we'd come in and cut decide things were wrong pull it out and put it back in the main goal was to smooth out the interior and begin to speak about motion and mobility and independent the biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you're designing there's actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer park there's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together where you can change materials and shave so that became a challenge compounding that the material of choice lamb in it that I. trying to highlight only Benz in two Dimensions is a compound curve interior what I had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell what I came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell and what I was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way and that the caseworker wouldn't break up the space they also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin so they function has an electrical Chase so that's the trailer pretty much finished that trailer to another commission to participate in what's called Tokyo designers block and it's a week of Furniture Design events in Tokyo in October Tarawa Kurosaki who owns furniture. play Colleen day he asked me to ship him to trailers to Tokyo he said one he would like to make a real trailer functioning and we would sell that one trailer number to you have a blank slate you can do anything you want we came up with a fantasy scenario of DJ traveling around the states that would collect records and go on tour this trailer House 2 turntables mixer wet bar fridge integrated sound system it's got a huge couch that's quite a few people and basically we've had a great time with this and so on this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel in Escape in an idiosyncratic since so a lot of these ideas migrated into the production trailers for Airstream this brings us up to the time that I started Consulting to Airstream they came to me and said well what can we do to freshen this thing up and do you think kids you know skateboarder Surfers rock climbers. use these things and I said well not in that interior but anyway I went out to Airstream about six times during this process of building this prototype and it's called the Bambi prototype I thought finally oh yeah great big company I'm going to work with somebody with money for tooling and molding and I walked in their prototype facility in it exactly like my shop only bigger and I'm same tools same thing so the problem became and they set this 11 to me that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology and there's no money for tooling or molding the trailers themselves are actually hand-built all the case work is hand scribed in uniquely so you can't just cut a hundred parts for a hundred trailers you have to cut them big in every single one is hand fit they didn't want to go to a component eyes system. and there it is that's the Bambi 16. Pokemon games.,,
108,ChristopherMcDougall_2010X.sph.wav,paula radcliffe the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck out of derartu tulu 's under underdog hands suddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back ruins the script instead of taking off she falls back and she grabs paula radcliffe says come on go except derartu tulu ruins the script again instead of losing she blazes past the lead pack and wins wins the new york city marathon goes home with a big fat check it's a heartwarming story but if you drill a little bit deeper you've got to sort of wonder about what exactly was going on there you have two outliers in one organism it's not a coincidence when you have someone who is more competitive and more compassionate than anybody else in the race just right left right left yeah i mean we've been doing it for two million years so it's kind of arrogant to assume that i've got something to say can be found down in the copper canyons of mexico where there's a tribe a reclusive tribe called the tarahumara indians now the tarahumara are remarkable for three things number one is they have been living essentially unchanged for the past four hundred years when the conquistadors arrived in north america you had two choices you either fight back and engage or you could take off the mayans and aztecs engaged which is why there are very few mayans and aztecs the tarahumara had a different strategy they took off and hid in this the second thing remarkable about the tarahumara is deep into old age seventy to eighty years old these guys aren't running marathons they're running mega marathons they're not doing twenty six miles they're doing one hundred one hundred and fifty miles at a time and apparently without injury without problems the last thing that's remarkable about the tarahumara is that all the things that so what's the connection again we're talking about outliers there's got to be some kind of cause and effect there better a long time ago but the cool thing about running as i've discovered is that something bizarre happens in this activity all the time case in point well there are teams of scientists at harvard and the university of utah that are bending their brains to try to figure out what the tarahumara have known forever they're trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries and once again a mystery wrapped inside of a mystery the human brain exploded in size australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain suddenly humans show up homo erectus big old melon head to have a brain of that size you need to have a source of condensed caloric energy in other words early humans are eating dead animals no argument that's a fact is the first edged weapons only appeared about two hundred thousand years ago so somehow for nearly two million years we are killing animals without any weapons now we're not using our strength because we are the biggest sissies in the jungle every other animal is stronger than we are they have fangs they have claws they have nimbleness they have speed we think usain bolt is fast usain bolt can get his ass kicked by a squirrel we're not that would be an olympic event turn a squirrel loose whoever catches the squirrel you get a gold medal no weapons no speed no strength no fangs no claws how were we killing these animals a couple months ago if you saw the new york city marathon i guarantee you you saw something that no one has ever seen before an ethiopian woman named derartu but you get to the marathon we were just talking about you guys have only been allowed to run the marathon for twenty years because prior to the nineteen eighties and i've yet to see any runner like ann trason or nikki kimball or jenn shelton you put them in a race of fifty or one hundred miles against anybody in the world and it's a coin toss who 's a couple years ago emily baer signed up for a race called the hardrock one hundred which tells you all you need to know about the race they give you forty eight hours to finish this race turns up at the starting line she's thirty seven years old she hasn't won a marathon of any kind in eight years and a few months previous she almost died in childbirth if you start running the marathon at age nineteen you will get progressively faster year by year until you reach your peak at age twenty seven and then after that you succumb to the rigors of time and you'll get slower and slower until eventually you're back to running the same speed you were at age nineteen so about seven years eight years to reach your peak and then gradually you fall off your peak until you go back to the starting point you would think it might take eight years to go back to the same speed maybe ten years no it's forty five years sixty year old men and women are running as fast as they were at age nineteen now i defy you to come up with any other physical activity and please don't say golf something that actually is hard where geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers so you have these three mysteries is there one piece in the puzzle which might wrap all these things up but i'll submit this to you if you put one piece in the middle of this jigsaw puzzle suddenly it all starts to form a coherent picture if you wonder why is it the tarahumara don't fight and don't die of heart disease why a poor ethiopian woman named derartu tulu can be the most compassionate and yet the most competitive and why we somehow were able to find food without weapons we evolved as a hunting pack animal because the one advantage we have in the wilderness again it's not our fangs and our claws and our speed the only thing we do really really well is sweat we're really good at being sweaty and smelly better than any other mammal on earth we can sweat really well but the advantage of that little bit of social discomfort is the fact that when it comes to running under hot heat for long distances we're superb we're the best on the planet you take a horse on a hot day and after five or six miles that horse has a choice it's either going to breathe or it's going to cool off but it ain't doing both we can so what if we evolved as hunting pack animals what if the only natural advantage we had in the world was the fact that we could get together as a group go out there on that african savannah pick out an antelope and go out as a pack and run that thing to death those expert trackers have got to be part of the pack they can't be ten miles behind you need to have the women and the adolescents there because the two times in your life you most benefit except bad news for derartu tulu some other people had the same idea including the olympic gold medalist and paula radcliffe who is a monster the fastest woman marathoner in history in other words is a culture remarkably similar to the tarahumara a tribe that has remained unchanged since the stone age it's a really compelling argument that maybe the how do we spoil it well how do we spoil anything we try to cash in on it we try to can it and package it and make it better and sell it to people and what happened was we started creating these fancy cushioned things which make running better called running shoes any kind of myths any kind of tall tales running is always associated with freedom and vitality and youthfulness and eternal vigor it's only in our lifetime that running has become associated with fear and pain i didn't do yoga i'm not ready humans ran and ran all the time we are here today we have our digital technology all of our science comes from the fact that our ancestors able to do something extraordinary every day which was just rely on their naked feet and legs to run long distances so how do we get back to that again well i would submit to you the first thing is get rid of all packaging all the sales all the marketing get rid of all the stinking running shoes stop focusing on urban marathons which if you do four hours you suck if you do three fifty nine point five nine you're awesome because you qualified for another race we need to get back to that sense of playfulness and joyfulness and i would say nakedness that has made the the healthiest and serene cultures in our time the gun goes off and she's not even an underdog she's under the underdogs a little too extreme about this imagine a world where everybody could go out their door and engage in the kind of exercise that's going to make them more relaxed more serene more healthy and what the tarahumara have always been i don't say let 's go back to the copper canyons and live on corn and maiz which is the tarahumara 's preferred diet but maybe there's somewhere in between and if we find that thing maybe there is a big fat nobel prize out there because if somebody could find a way to restore but the under underdog hangs tough and twenty two miles into a twenty six mile race there is derartu tulu up there with the lead pack so what i've been seeing today is there is a growing subculture of barefoot runners people who got rid of their shoes and what they have found uniformly is you get rid of you get rid of the stress you get rid of the injuries and the ailments and what you find is something the tarahumara have know for a very long time that this can be a whole lot of now this is when something really bizarre happens,1,"running you know it's basically just right left right left yeah I know we've been doing it for 2 million years so it's kind of arrogance to assume that I've got something to say that has been said and performed better a long time ago for the cool thing about running as I've discovered is it something bizarre happens in this activity all the time case-in-point couple months ago if I guarantee you you saw something that no one has ever seen before and Ethiopian woman named walked into Lou turns up the starting line she's 37 years old she hasn't won a marathon of any kind and eight years in a few months previously she's almost died in childbirth was ready to hang it up and retire from the sport but she decided she'd go For Broke and try for one last big payday in the Marquee event the New York City marathon accept including the Olympic gold medalist and who is a monster the fastest. marathoner in history by far only 10 minutes off the men's World Record Paula Radcliffe is essentially unbeatable Underdog she's like an Under The Underdogs but the under Underdog hang stuff in 22 mi into a 26-mile race there is there are two up there with the lead pack now this is something really bizarre happens the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck out of the water to lose under Underdog and something grabs your leg starts to fall back so we all know what to do in this situation right to give her a quick crack your elbow. door to Tulum ruins the script instead of taking off she falls back if he grabs Puerto Rico just come on unfortunately back and is pushing for the Finish Line then she falls back again and certain times or two to Lou says I'm done go such a fantastic story on how dance she loses a check when she comes home with something bigger and more important Marathon big fat check. it is heartwarming story but if you drill a little bit deeper you've got to sort of wonder about what exactly was going on there you know when you have two outliers in one organism it's not a coincidence when you have someone who is more competitive and more compassionate than anybody else in the race against not a coincidence you show me creature with webbed feet and gills somehow water is involved somewhere that kind of hard there's some kind of connection there and the answer to it I think can be found down in the Copper Canyon of Mexico where there's a tribe A reclusive tribe called the title not in use now they are remarkable for three things number one is they have been living essentially unchanged for the past four hundred years or you could take off the mines in the Aztecs engaged which is why they're very few Mayans and Aztecs had a different strategy they took off and hid in this Labyrinth. can kind of spider webbing system of canyons called The Copper Canyon and there they remained since the 1600s essentially the same. the second thing remarkable about the title matter is deep in the old age 70 and 80 years old these guys aren't running marathons they're running a marathon 26 Mi a hundred a hundred fifty miles at a time and pain without injury without problems the last thing this remark about the title mod is all the things that we talked about today all the things that we're trying to come up with more technology and brainpower to solve things like heart disease and cholesterol and cancer and crime and warfare and violence and clinical depression all this stuff the time I done what you talking about they are free from all of these modern elements. so what's the connection to get we're talking about a Liars have got you some kind of cause and effect their well there are teams of scientists at Harvard and the University of Utah that are betting their brain trying to figure out what the title might have known forever they're trying to solve those same kind of mysteries and perhaps the key to the mystery switch go like this three things if you have the answer to come up here to take the microphone because nobody else knows the answer and if you know it then you are smarter than anybody else on planet Earth miss your number one is this two million years ago the human brain exploded in size Australopithecus had a tiny little pea-brain silly human show up in a homo erectus big old melon head to have a brain in that size you need to have a source of condensed energy in other words early humans are eating dead animals no argument that's a fact. the only problem is the first edged weapons only appeared about 200,000 years ago so somehow for nearly two million years we are killing animals without any weapons now we're not using our strength because we are the biggest issues in the jungle we're stronger than we are that speed Usain Bolt is faster Usain Bolt in the Olympics event turn squirrel squirrel you get a gold medal. so no weapons no speed no strength of financial Clause how we kill these animals were, but all women sprinters they all suck you're terrible there's not a fast woman on the planet in the never has been the fastest woman to ever run a mile in 415 I can throw a rock and hit like a high school boy who can run faster and 4:15 for some reason you guys are just really slow. but you get to the marathon we're just talking about you guys want to be allowed to run the marathon for 20 years because prior to the 1980s Medical Science said that if a woman tried to run 26 miles while you're banned from the marathon before the 90 days. a uterus would be torn yes you would have torn reproductive organs uterus would fall out slowly flood light. not going to lie marathons and I've yet to see any any. so tell me 20 years. it would have been allowed to run the marathon in that very short learning curve you guys have been gone from a broken organs out to the fact that you're only ten minutes off the mail world record into the distance that medical science supposed to be fatal to humans die when you put them in a race a 50 or 100 miles I guess anybody in the world who's going to win a given example a couple years ago and Lee bear sign up for a race called the Hard Rock 100 which tells you all you need to know about the race TV 42 hours to finish this race when we bare 500 Runners place in the top 10 even though she stopped at all the Aid Station to breastfeed her baby during the race. I need a p 492 other people the last mr. so why is it that women get stronger as distant as get longer gave the third mysteries of this at the University of Utah they started tracking finishing times for people running a marathon and what they found is that if you start running the marathon the age 19 you will get progressively faster year by year until you reach your Peak age 27 and laughter that you should come to the rigors of time you get slower and slower I don't mention your back to running the same speed you were at age nineteen seventy years 8 years and then gradually fall off your P until you get back to the starting point. you would think I might take that maybe 8 years to go back to the same speed maybe ten years no it's 45 years 64 year old men and women are running as fast as they were at age 19 Buyers Club in any other physical activity and please don't say golf something that actually hard. where are geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers say these three mysteries. is there one kind of piece in the puzzle which might wrap all these things up any time someone looks back in prehistory and try to give you some some Global answer because it being prehistory and I just want and get away with it but I'll send this to you if you put one piece in the middle of this jigsaw puzzle suddenly it all starts to form a coherent picture if you wanted why is it the total amount of don't fight and don't die of heart disease why a poor Ethiopian woman and daughter to Lou can be the most compassionate the most competitive and Why We Were Somehow able to find food without weapons for half is because humans as much as we like to think of ourselves as Masters of the Universe Ashley evolved as nothing more than a pack of hunting dogs maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal because the one advantage we have in the wilderness again it's not our fangs in her closet or speed the only thing we do really really well is is sweat we're really good at being sweaty and smelly. but Avenger that that stupid of social discomfort is the fact that when it comes to running under hotkey for long distances we're Super Bowl where the best on the planet you take a horse on a hot day and after five or six miles that a horse has a choice it's either going to breathe or going to cool off but it ain't doing both we can so what if we evolved as hunting pack animals with the only natural Advantage we had in the world was the fact that we can get together as a group go out there and an African savanna pick out an antelope to death that's all we can do we can run really far on a hot day well that's true all the things have to be true as well the key to be a part of a hunting pack is the word pack if you are by yourself and I guarantee you there's only two drivers out there in the savanna. you need to pack to pull together you need to have those 64 65 year olds are doing it for a long time to understand which animal do I should try to catch the other heard explodes in the gathers back again those expert trackers of the pack 2K be ten miles behind need to have the women and adolescents there because the two times in your life you most benefit from animal protein is when you are a nursing mother and developing adolescent it makes no sense to have the envelope over their dead and people want to eat at 50 miles away is part of the pack you need to have this 27 year old stud the peak of their powers ready to drop to kill I need to have those teenagers their who should learn the whole thing all involved the pack stays together. love you happy true about this pack this pack cannot be really materialistic to KP hole in all your crap around trying to chase Antelope you can't be a pissed-off pack you can't be very pissed me off last night to pack has got to be able to swallow his ego be cooperative and pull together would you end up with in other words is a culture remarkably similar to the top of a tribe that has remained unchanged since the Stone Age that is awesome on our time just would have gone off the path and we look at running is his kind of alien foreign thing another it's punishment you got to do cuz he pizza tonight before but maybe something different maybe we're the ones who've taken this this natural Advantage we had and we spoiled it. how do you spoil well how do you spell anyting we try to cash in on it right and package it and make it better and sell it to people and it would happen was we charge of creating these fancy cushion things which have been running better called personally pissed off at running shoes to hurt anybody in here runs and I had a conversation with Carl we talk for 2 minutes backstage and she's talking about plantar fasciitis you talk to a runner I guarantee you the 30 seconds the conversation turns to injury so humans evolved then why are we so bad at it why do we keep getting hurt running and running injuries is that the running injury is new to our time if you reach folklore and mythology any kind of Tall Tales running is always associated with freedom and vitality and youthfulness and eternal Vigor lifetime that running has become associated with fear and pain to say that. and my legs I only trust my legs because and Apache Triathlon used to be you run 50 miles across a desert engage in hand-to-hand combat see a bunch of horses and slap leather for home oh you know something right this week off I need a cross train and I didn't do yoga I'm not ready. humans ran and ran all the time we are here today we have our digital technology or science comes from the fact that our ancestors were able to do something extraordinary every day which was just rely on their naked feet and legs to run long distances so how to get back to that again all I would submit to you the first thing is get rid of all the packaging all the sales all the marketing get rid of all the stinking running shoes stop focusing on Urban marathons would she know if you do four hours you suck if you 359.59 you're awesome cuz you qualify for other race we need to get back that sense of playfulness and joyfulness and I would say nakedness that has made the title Mata one of the healthiest and Serene cultures in our time. what's the benefits or what so you don't see you burn out the Haagen-Dazs from the night before but maybe there's another benefit there as well you know that getting a little too extreme about this imagine in a world where everybody could go out the door and engage in the kind of exercise that's going to make them more relaxed more Serene more healthy burn off stress were you don't come back into your office of raging Maniac anymore we don't go home with a lot of stress on top of you again maybe there's something between what we are today and what the title might have always been corn advice which is the tomatoes prefer died but you may be there somewhere in between and if we find that thing there is a big fat Nobel Prize out there because if somebody could find a way to restore that natural ability that we all enjoyed for most of our existence up to the 1970s or so the benefits social and physical and and political and and metal could be us. so we haven't seen today is there is kind of a growing subculture of their forerunners people who got rid of their shoes and what they have found uniformly is you get rid of the shoes you get rid of the stress you get rid of the injuries in the elements and what you find is Sophie the title but I've known for very long time is that this can be a whole lot of fun I've experienced a person myself I was in here all my life and then in my right before you get rid of my shoes and my running elements of going away too so hopefully something we can all benefit from and I appreciate you guys

109,ChristopherPoole_2010.sph.wav,the largest memes that have come out of this site some of you might be familiar with are these lolcats just silly pictures of cats with text and this resonates with millions there are tens of thousands of these and there is a whole blogging empire now dedicated to pictures like these and rick astley 's kind of rebrith these past two years rickroll was this bait and switch really simple classic bait and switch there are thousands of memes that come out of the site there are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream the ones i've just shown you but every day every month people are producing thousands of these like this have rules we do they're the codified rules that i've come up with which are more or less ignored by the community and so they've come up with their own set of rules the rules of the internet and so there are three that i want to show you specifically rule one is you don't talk about b two is you do not talk about i will spare you that slide i assure you it is very true b is the first board we started with and it is in many ways the beating heart of the website it is where a third of all the traffic is going and b is known for more than anything not just the memes they've created but the exploits and chris just touched on one of those a second ago and that was the time one hundred poll so somebody at time at the magazine thought it would be fun to nominate me for this thing they did last year and so they placed me on it and the internet got wind of it my community i didn't instruct them to do it they just decided that that's what they wanted and so you know three hundred and ninety percent approval rating ain't so bad so they broke that and i ended up on top i ended up at this really fancy party but that's not what's interesting about this it's that they weren't putting me at the top of this list they were actually it got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed all of the top twenty one places to spell marblecake also the game the amount of time and effort that went into that is very famously scientology and so the story is scientology had this embarrassing video of tom cruise it went up online they got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the internet and they've been dogging me for a year i got to tell you it's driving me nuts actually sometimes i wake up in the middle of so we've got this activist group that's this grassroots group that's come out of the site and last i'm going to show you the example the story of dusty the cat is the name that we've given to this cat this young man for people to do something about this so what they did is they i mean they put c s i to shame here the internet detectives came out they matched they found his myspace they took the youtube video and they mashed everything in the video and within twenty four hours they had his name and within forty eight hours he was arrested sites like it are kind of going the way of the dinosaur right now they're endangered because we're moving towards social networking we're moving towards persistent identity we're moving towards you know a lack of privacy really we're sacrificing a lot of that and i think in doing so moving towards those things we're losing something valuable you that this is not being streamed to them live right now well you never know some of them we've got people in seventy five countries tell when i was fifteen i found this yes and no i mean for as much good that kind of comes out of this environment there is plenty of bad there are plenty of downsides but i think that the greater good is words saying things you know can be constructive it can be really damaging and if you cut the link between what is said and any attribution back to you i mean surely there are huge risks with that there are certainly but the board what you might say at ted right yeah i posted a thread on sunday and within twenty four hours it had over twelve thousand responses the thing is i didn't make it into that presentation because i can't read to you anything that they said know bleeped out but there were some good things that i'm not sure i would have necessarily recommended everyone at ted to go and check it out anyway yourself i mean you're a figure of some intrigue you've got this surprising semi underground influence but it's not making you a lot of money yet what's the commercial picture the commercial picture is that there really isn't much of one i guess the site has adult content on it it's got some very obscene content on it just in terms of language alone and when you've got that you've pretty much sacrificed any hope of making lots of money first very kind of pained awkward conversations the content is not dinner table conversation in the least but my parents i think part of why they and so in ten years time what do you picture yourself a good question as i said i just went back to school and i am considering majoring in urban studies and then going on to urban planning kind of taking whatever i've learned from online communities and trying to adapt that to what it looks like so what's unique about the site is that it's anonymous and it has no memory there's no archive are no barriers there's no registration these things that we're used to with forums don't exist on four chan and that's led to this discussion that's completely raw completely unfiltered,1,"Star Fox 20. yeah and they've been doggin me for a year until you drive me nuts actually sometime I wake up in the middle of the night ice cream. why was 15 I found this website called Futaba Channel and it was a Japanese form board. and that format of forum at that time was not well known outside of Japan it's what I did is I took it translated into English and I stuck it up my friends to use a later people are using it to something over 700,000 post per month or per day rather bored to 48 Fords. that's what it looks like the site is that it's Anonymous and it has no memory there's no archive there no barriers that there's no registration were you still with worms don't exist on Fortune and that's that's led to this discussion that's completely wrong. and with the sites known for because because it has this environment is it supposed to be creation of a lot of Internet phenomena viral videos and whatnot knows memes. to the largest memes that have come out of the site so we might be familiar with Hardee's low pass just silly pictures of cats with text and this resonates with millions of people around because there are tens of thousands of bees in their blocking Empire now dedicated to pictures like these and Rick astley's kind of rebirth these past two years it really simple tasks and bait and switch somebody says they don't need to something interesting and you get an 80s pop song that's all it was and it got big enough to the point where there was a float last year the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and Rick Astley pops out and Rick rolls millions of people on television. there are thousands means I come out of sight and there are a handful that have escaped into mainstream the ones I'm just showing you but there are just about every every every day every month there are people are producing thousands of rules which are more or less ignored by the community are the rules of the internet and when I want to say specifically. can you not talk about me and this one thing if it exists there is porn of it no exceptions and I will spare you that slide I assure you it is is very true. babe is the first part we started with and it is in many ways it is is it a beating heart of the website it is where a third of all the traffic is going in and he is is known for more than anyting not just means that they created but the exploits and then Chris just touched on one of those a second ago and that was the time 100 full so at the magazine. It would be fun to nominate me for this this thing they did last year and so that they placed me on it and the internet.. decided they wanted me to win it I didn't instruct them to do it they just decided to that's what they wanted and so you know 309% approval rating and so bad they broke out hole and then I ended up on top I ended up at this really fancy party but that's not what's interesting about this it's that not they were the top of this list they were actually it got so supposed to get in the point where they gained all of the top 21 place has to spell marble cake also the game. the amount of time and effort that went into that is an absolutely incredible and marble cake is significant because it is the channel That this group called Anonymous organized Anonymous is this group of people. that protested very famously Scientology and so the story is Scientology have this embarrassing video of Tom Cruise went up online face got taken off line and managed to piss off the internet and so these people over 7,000 people less than one month later organized in 100 cities around the globe and this is La protested the Church of Scientology and Dave continue to do so now two full years after the fact they are still protesting.so we we've got this activist group that's the scratches group that's come out of the site and plastic example the story of Dusty the cat is the name that was given to this this this young man posted a video of him abusing his cat on YouTube and sit well with with people and said there was a outpouring of support for people to do something about this. so what they did is they sent me for CSI the same here they just came out and they match they found his Myspace they they took YouTube video and they matched up everything to you and within 24 hours to have his name and within 48 Hours he was arrested. and so what I think is really intriguing about me like four Chan is just that it's it's this open place and they said it's raw unfiltered and sites are kind of going the way of the dinosaur right now that they're endangered because we're moving towards social networking moving towards persistent identity we're moving towards I think in doing so moving towards those things we're losing something valuable thank you. so I got a couple questions for you but if I Austin is the tide website going to go down and we'll see you never know some of them is when you made the case that but I'm not an embassy allows people to say anything all the rules gone you've had to wrestle with issues like child pronography and I understand this with you you sometimes lie awake in the night wearing that you've opened Pandora's Box. it's a yes and a no I mean that for as far as much good that that kind of comes out of this this environment there is plenty of bad but I think that the greater good is that it is being served here by just allowing people there are very few places now where you can go and not have I didn't say whatever you'd like. I think it's doing whatever you're like it is now crossing a line but I think it's important to have these places where can I get emails people say thank you for working and myself was saying things you know can be constructive and if you cut the link between what it said and any extradition back to you I mean that there are huge risk with that. there are certainly but. tell me about what some of the board what you might say at ten thousand responses just would have been and I went out but they're still up there now it is it hasn't taken off. okay well.. I'm not sure I would have recommended ever and it had to go and check it out anyway but send me underground in a influence but it's not making you a lot of money yet what what's the what's the commercial picture of you know when you've gotten the site has adult content on it and it obviously it's got some very offensive and when you've got that you've pretty much sacrifice any hope of making lots of money are you supposed to use you still live at home right now I'm back in back in school right now but what conversations did you or do you have with your mother about full-time. a person very kind of pain. Awkward conversations the fight is in the content is not dinner table conversation in the least my parents are able to appreciate it if they don't understand it. they'll probably pleased to see you on top of the time. I must have been in plenty of time what would you picture yourself today. does a good question I just went back to school and I am considering majoring in urban studies and then going on to urban planning kind of taking what I've been trying to adapt that to Chris thank you",,

can see this pattern in his own brain he can learn how to control it there have been three ways to try to impact the brain the therapist 's couch pills and the knife this is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have we all know that as we form thoughts they form deep channels in our minds and our brains chronic pain is an example if you burn yourself you pull your hand away but if you're still in pain in six months or six years time it's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you if we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain we can form three d models and watch in real time the brain process information and then we can select the areas that produce the pain so put your arms back up and flex your now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing what you're seeing here is we've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain may shock you but we're literally reading this person 's brain in real time they're watching their own brain activation and they're controlling the pathway that produces their pain they're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates as they do it in the upper left is a display that's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled when they control their brain they can

people have wanted to look inside the human mind the human brain for thousands of years well coming out of the research labs just now for our generation is the possibility to do that but now we have a

111,ClayShirky_2005G.sph.wav,if there is an answer to that that happens outside the professional framework of journalism it makes no sense to take a professional metaphor and apply it to this distributed class so as much as we want the shield laws in new york city on the first saturday of every summer coney island our local charmingly run down amusement park hosts the mermaid parade background the institution to which they were attached is becoming incoherent here 's another example pro ana the pro ana groups these are groups of teenage girls who have taken on web logs bulletin boards other kinds of cooperative infrastructure and have used it to set up support groups for remaining anorexic by choice they post pictures of thin models which they call thinspiration they have little slogans like salvation through starvation they even have lance armstrong style bracelets these red bracelets which signify in the small group i am trying to maintain my eating disorder they trade tips like if you feel like eating something clean a toilet or the litter box the feeling will pass we're used to support groups being beneficial we have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial but it turns out that the logic of the support group is value neutral a support group is simply a small group that wants to maintain a way of living in the context of a larger group now when the larger group is a bunch of drunks and the small group wants to stay sober then we think that's a great support group when the small group is teenage girls who want to stay anorexic by choice then we're horrified what's happened is that the normative goals of the support groups that we're used to came from the institutions that were framing them and not from the infrastructure the infrastructure becomes generically available the logic of the support group has been revealed to be accessible to anyone including people pursuing these kind of goals so there are significant downsides to these changes as well as it's an amateur parade people come from all over the city people get all dressed up some people get less dressed up young and old dancing in the streets colorful characters and a good time is had by all of course in the current environment one need allude only lightly to the work of non state actors trying to influence global affairs and taking advantage of these this is a social map of the hijackers and their associates who perpetrated the nine eleven attack this is the part of the talk where i tell you what's going to come as a result of all of this but i'm running out of time which is good because i don't know right as with the printing press if it's really a revolution it doesn't take us from point a to point b it takes us from point a to chaos the printing press precipitated two hundred years of chaos moving from a world where the catholic church was the sort of organizing political force to the treaty of westphalia when we finally knew what the new unit was the nation state now i'm not predicting two hundred years of chaos as a result of this fifty fifty years in which loosely coordinated groups are going to be given increasingly high leverage and the more those groups forego traditional institutional imperatives like deciding in advance what's going to happen or the profit motive the more leverage they'll get and institutions are going to come under an increasing degree of pressure and the more rigidly managed and the more they rely on information monopolies the greater the the point here is not this is wonderful or we 're going to see a transition from only institutions to only cooperative framework it's going to be much more complicated than that but the point is that it's going to be a massive readjustment and since we can see it in advance and know coming my argument is essentially we might as well get good at it thank how do groups get anything done right how do you organize a group of individuals so that the output of the group is something coherent and of lasting value instead of just being chaos and the answer is i got them from flickr flickr is a photo sharing service that allows people to take photos upload them share them over the web recently flickr has added an additional function called tagging tagging was pioneered by del icio us and joshua schachter del icio us is a social book marking service tagging is a cooperative infrastructure answer to classification right if i had given this talk last year i couldn't do what i just did because i couldn't have found those photos shown in reverse chronological order and i was then able to go and retrieve them to give you that little slideshow now what hard problem is being solved here and it's in the most schematic possible view it's a coordination problem right there are a large number of people on the internet a very small fraction of them have photos of the mermaid parade how do we get those people together to contribute that work the classic answer is to form an institution right to draw those people into some pre arranged structure that has explicit goals and i want to call your attention to some of the side effects of going the institutional route first of all when you form an institution you take on a management problem right no good just hiring employees you also have to hire other employees to manage those employees and to enforce the goals of the institution and so forth you have to bring structure into place right you have to have economic structure you have to have legal structure you have to have physical structure and the economic framing of that problem is called coordination costs and a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output and that creates additional costs third forming an institution is inherently exclusionary you notice we haven't got everybody who has a photo you can't hire everyone in a company right you can't recruit everyone into a governmental organization you have to exclude some people and fourth as a result of that exclusion you end up with a professional class look at the change here we've gone from people with photos to photographers right we've created a professional class of photographers whose goal is to go out and photograph the mermaid parade or whatever else they're sent out to photograph when you build cooperation into the infrastructure which is the flickr answer you can leave the people where they are you take the problem to the individuals rather than moving the individuals to the problem you arrange the coordination in the group and by doing that you get the same outcome without the institutional difficulties you lose the institutional imperative you lose the right to shape people 's work when it's volunteer effort but you also shed the institutional cost which gives you greater flexibility what flickr does is it replaces planning with coordination and this is a general aspect of these cooperative systems you'll have experienced this in your life whenever you bought your first mobile phone and you stopped making plans you just said i'll call you when i get call me when you get off work right that is a point to point replacement of coordination with planning now able to do that kind of thing with groups to say instead of we must make an advance plan we must have a five year projection of where the wikipedia is going to be or whatever you can just say let 's coordinate the group effort and let 's deal with it as we go because we're now well enough coordinated that we don't have to take on the problems of and worst of all that figure at the bottom approximately ten photos per photographer is a it's mathematically true but it doesn't really talk about anything important because in these systems the average isn't really what matters what matters is this taken per photographer you can see here over at the end our most prolific photographer has taken around three hundred and fifty photos and you can see there's a few people who have taken hundreds of photos then there's dozens of people who 've taken dozens of photos and by the time we get around here we get ten or fewer photos and then there's this long flat is called a power law distribution it appears often in unconstrained social systems where people are allowed to contribute as much or as little as they like this is often what you get the math behind the power law distribution is that whatever 's in the nth position is doing about one nth of whatever 's being measured relative to the person in the first position so we'd expect the tenth most prolific photographer to have contributed about a tenth of the photos and the one hundredth most prolific photographer to have contributed only about one hundred as many photos as the most prolific photographer private or public it can be for profit or not profit it can be large or small but you get these resources together you found an institution and you use the institution to coordinate the activities of the group so the head of the curve can be sharper or flatter but that basic math accounts both for the steep slope and for the long flat tail and curiously in these systems as they grow larger the systems don't converge they diverge more in bigger systems the head gets bigger and the tail gets longer so the imbalance increases you can see the curve is obviously heavily left weighted here 's how heavily you go down to five percent you're still accounting for sixty percent of the photos if you go down to one percent exclude ninety nine percent of the group effort is actually here way to the left and that sounds strange to our ears but what ends up happening is that eighty percent of the contributors have contributed a below average amount that sounds strange because we expect average and middle to be about the same but they're not at all this is the math underlying the eighty twenty rule right whenever you hear anybody talking about the eighty twenty rule this is what's going on and the eighty percent zone is a no carrot and no stick zone the costs of running the institution mean that you cannot more recently because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination take on the work of those people easily in an institutional frame the institutional model always pushes leftwards treating these people as employees the institutional response is i can get seventy five percent of the value for ten percent of the hires great that's what i'll do the cooperative infrastructure model says why do you want to give up a quarter of the value if your system is designed so that you have to give up a quarter of the value re engineer the system don't take on the cost that prevents you from getting to the contributions of these people the system so that anybody can contribute at any amount so the coordination response asks not how are these people as employees but rather what is their contribution like right we have over here psycho milt flickr user who has contributed one and only one photo titled iraq and here 's the photo right labeled bad day at work right so the question is do you want that photo yes or no the question is not is psycho milt a good employee and the tension here is between institution as enabler and institution as obstacle when you're dealing with the left hand edge of one of these distributions when you're dealing with the people who spend a lot of time producing a lot of the material you want that's an institution as enabler world you can hire those people as employees you can coordinate their work and you can get some but when you're down here where the psycho milts of the world are adding one photo at a time that's institution as obstacle there has been a second answer which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by product of the operating of the system first goal of the institution immediately shifts from whatever the nominal goal was to self preservation and the actual goal of the institution goes to two through right so when institutions are told they are obstacles and that there are other ways of coordinating the value they go through something a little bit like the kubler ross stages of to the acceptance phase many many institutions are still in denial but we're seeing recently a lot of both anger and right because the fact that they have coordinated themselves to create cooperative value is depriving them of revenue you can follow this in the guardian it's actually quite steve ballmer now ceo of microsoft was criticizing linux a couple of years ago and he said oh this business of thousands of programmers contributing to linux this is a myth right we've looked at who 's contributed to linux and most of the patches have been produced by programmers who 've only done one thing you can hear this distribution under that complaint and you can see why from ballmer 's point of view that's a bad idea right we hired this programmer he came in he drank our cokes and played foosball for three years and he had one idea right the psycho milt question is was it a good idea without regard to institutional models so that's what i want to talk about today i'm going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples but always pointing to the broader themes what if it was a security patch what if it was a security patch for a buffer overflow exploit of which windows has not some several do you want that patch right that a single programmer can without having to move into a professional relation to an institution improve linux once and never be seen from again should terrify ballmer because this kind of value is unreachable in classic institutional frameworks but is part of cooperative systems of open source software of file sharing of the wikipedia i've used a lot of examples from flickr but there are actually stories about this from all over meetup a service founded so that users could find people in their local area who share their interests and affinities and actually have a real world meeting offline in a cafe or a pub or what have you when scott heiferman founded meetup he thought it would be used for you know train spotters and cat fanciers classic affinity groups the inventors don't know what the invention is number one group on meetup right now most chapters in most cities with most members most active stay at home moms right in the suburbanized dual income united states stay at home moms are actually missing the social infrastructure that comes from extended family and local small scale neighborhoods so they're reinventing it using these tools meetup is the platform but the value here is in social infrastructure if you want to know what technology is going to change the world don't pay attention to thirteen year old boys pay attention to young mothers because they have got not an ounce of support for technology that doesn't materially make their lives better this is so much more important than xbox but it's a lot less glitzy i think this is a revolution i think that this is a start by trying to answer a question that i know each of you will have asked yourself at some point or other and which the internet is purpose built to answer which is where can i get a picture of a roller skating mermaid really profound change in the way human affairs are arranged and i use that word advisedly it's a revolution in that it's a change in equilibrium it's a whole new way of doing things which includes new downsides in the united states right now a woman named judith miller is in jail for not having given to a federal grand jury her sources she's a reporter for the new york times her sources in a very abstract and hard to follow case and journalists are in the street rallying to improve the shield laws the shield laws are our laws pretty much a patchwork of state laws that prevent a journalist from having to betray a source this is happening however against the background of the rise of web logging web logging is a classic example of mass amateurization it has de professionalized publishing want to publish globally anything you think today it is a one button operation that you can do for free that has sent the professional class of publishing down into the ranks of mass amateurization and so the shield law as much as we want it we want a professional class of truth tellers it is becoming increasingly incoherent because the institution is becoming incoherent there are people in the states right now tying themselves into knots trying to figure out whether or not bloggers are journalists and the answer to that question is it doesn't matter because that's not the right question journalism was an answer to an even more important question which is how will society be informed how will they share ideas and opinions,1,"how do groups get anything done how do you organize a group of individuals so that the output of the group is something coherent and of lasting value instead of just being chaos and the economic framing of that problem is called coordination costs and coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output and we had a classic answer for coordination cost which is if you want to coordinate the work of group a group of people you start an institution like you raise some resources you found something it can be private or public it can be for profit or not profit can be large or small but you get these resources together you found an institution and you use the institution to coordinate the activities of the group. more recently because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor and communication cost of one of the big inputs to coordination there's been a second answer which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a byproduct of the operating of the system without regard to institutional models so that's what I want to talk about the Illustrated with some fairly concrete examples but always always pointed to the broader themes so I'm going to start by trying to answer a question that I know each of you will have asked yourself at some point or other which the internet is purpose-built to answer which is where can I get a picture of a roller skating Mermaid so. in New York City on the first Saturday of every summer Coney Island our local charmingly run-down amusement park hosts the Mermaid Parade it's an amateur parade people come from all over the city people get all dressed up some people get less stressed up young and old dancing in the streets colorful characters and Good Times had by all and what I want to call your attention to the Mermaid Parade itself Charming though it is rather to these photos I didn't take them how did I get any answers I got them from flicker flicker is a photo-sharing service that allows people to take photos upload them share them over the weather recently flicker has added an additional function called tagging tagging was pioneered by delicious and Joshua schachter which is delicious is a social bookmarking service. hacking is a Cooperative infrastructure answer to classification if I am given this talk last year I couldn't do what I just did because I couldn't have found those photos but instead of saying we need to hire a professional class of librarians to organize these photos once they're uploaded liquor simply turned over to the users the ability to characterize the photos so I was able to go in and draw down photos that have been tagged Mermaid Parade there were 30 100 photos taken by 118 photographers all aggregated and then put under this nice neat name on a show in Reverse chronological order has been able to go and retrieve them to to give you that little slideshow no one hard problem is being solved here and it's in the most schematic possible view it's a coordination problem there are a large number of people on the internet a very small fraction of them have photos of the Mermaid Parade how do we get those people together to contribute that work. the classic answer is to form an institution to draw those people into some prearranged structure that has explicit goals and I want to call your attention to some of the some of the side effects of of going the institutional route first of all when you form an institution you take on a management problem right no good just hiring employees you also have to hire other employees to manage those employees and to enforce the goals of the institution itself or you have to have economic structure you have to have legal structure you have to have physical structure and that creates additional costs third warming in the institution is inherently exclusionary you notice we haven't got everybody who has a photo you can't hire everyone in a company you can't recruit everyone into a governmental organization you have to exclude some people. and forth as a result of that exclusion you end up with a professional class look at the change here we going from people with photos to photographers right we've created a professional class of photographers whose goal is to go out and photograph the Mermaid Parade or whatever else they're sent out to to photograph. when you build cooperation into the infrastructure which is the flicker answer it you can leave the people where they are and you take the problem to the individuals rather than moving the individuals to the problem you arrange the coordination in in the group and by doing that you get the same outcome without the institutional difficulties you lose the institutional imperative you lose the right to shake people's work when it's volunteer effort but you also said the institutional costs which gives you greater flexibility. what's Flickr does is it replaces planning with coordination and this is a general aspect of these Cooperative systems you live experience this in your life whenever you bought your first mobile phone and you stopped making plans you just said I'll call you when I get there call me when you get off work right that is a point-to-point replacement of coordination with plan when we're now able to do that kind of thing with groups to say instead of we must make an advanced time we must have a five-year projection of where the Wikipedia is going to be or whatever you can just say let's coordinate the group effort and let's deal with it as we go because we're now well enough coordinator that we don't have to take on the the the problems of deciding in advance what to do so here's another example this one someone more, these are photos on Flickr tag Iraq. and everything that was hard about the coordination cost with the Mermaid Parade is is even harder here there are more pictures they're more photographers taking over a wider geographic area photos are spread out over a longer period of time and at worst of all that figure at the bottom approximately 10 photos per photographer is a lie it's it's mathematically true but it doesn't really talk about anything important because in these systems the average isn't really what matters what matters is this this is a graph of photographs tag Iraq as taken by the 529 photographers who contributed the 5445 photos and it's ranked in order of number of photos taken for a photographer you can see here. over everything and our most prolific photographer just taken around 350 photos need to see there's a few people who taken hundreds of photos and there's dozens of people who taken dozens of photos by the time I get around here we get 10 or fewer photos and then as long flat tail and by the time you get to the middle you've got hundreds of people who contributed only one photo is it called a power line distribution it appears in an unconstrained social systems were people are allowed to contribute as much or as little as they like this is often once you get the math behind the power loss of distribution is that whatever position is doing about 1 and that whatever is being measured relative to the person the first position so we expect the most prolific photographer to have contributed about a tenth of the photos and the hundred most prolific photographer to have contributed only about a hundredths as many photos as the most prolific photographer did. so go ahead of the curve can be sharper flattered but that basic math accounts both of the steep slope and the long flat tail and curiously in these systems as they grow larger the system's don't converge they diverge more and bigger systems the head gets bigger and the tail gets longer so the imbalance increases and you can see the curve is obviously have left waiting here is how heavily if you take the top 10% of photographers contributing to this system they account for three-quarters of the photos taken just the top 10% most prolific photographer if you go down to 5% you still accounting for 60% of the photos at 1% excluding 99% of the group effort and you're still at almost a quarter of the photos and because of this left waiting the average. is that secure way to the left that sounds strange stories but what ends up happening is it 80% of the contributors have contributed a below average amount that sounds great because we expect average in middle to be about the same but they're not at all. this is the math underlying 80-20 rule right whenever you hear anybody talking about the 80-20 rule this is what's going on tonight the the tithe 20% of the merchandise accounts for 80% of the revenue 20% of the users use 80% of the resources this is the shape people are talking about when that happens. No sticks Zone the costs of running the institution mean that you cannot. take on the work of those people easily in an Institutional print the institutional model always pushes leftwards treating these people as employees the institution responses I can get 75% of the value for 10% of the highest grape that's what I'll do the Cooperative infrastructure model says why do you want to give up a quarter of the value if your system is designed so that you have to give up a quarter of the value re-engineer the system don't take on the cost that prevents you from getting to the contributions of these people. build the system so that anybody can contribute at any amount so the the coordination response. asks not how these people is employees but rather what is their contribution like we have over here so I can built a Flickr user who's contributed one and only one photo titled Iraq and here's the photo labeled bad day at work so the question is do you want that photo yes or no the question is not is psycho Milt a good employee. invitation here is between institution as an abler an institution as I'm still go when you're dealing with the left-hand edge of one of these distributions when you're dealing with the people who spend a lot of time producing a lot of the material you want that's an institution as an abler world you can hire those people as employees you can coordinate that work and you can get some out but when you're down here with the world are adding one photo at a time like that institution as obstacle institutions hate being told their obstacles one of the first things that happens when you institutionalize a problem is that the institution the first goal of the institution immediately shifts from whatever the nominal goal was to self preservation and the actual goal of the institutions ghost ghost 22 through an institution or told there are obstacles and if there are other ways of coordinating the Valium. they go to something a little bit like the Kubler-Ross stages of a reaction being told you have a fatal illness denial anger bargaining acceptance have most of the Co-operative systems we've seen haven't been around long enough to have to have got to the acceptance pay as many many institutions are still in denial but we're seeing recently a lot of both anger and bargaining and wonderful small example going on right now in France a bus company is suing people for forming a carpool because the fact that they have coordinated themselves to create Cooperative value is depriving them of Revenue you can follow this in the guardian it's actually quite it's quite painting the bigger question is what do you do about the value down here how do you capture that an institution such as I said are are are prevented from capturing that. Steve Ballmer announced CEO of Microsoft was criticizing Lenox a couple of years ago and he said all this business of thousands of programmers contributing to lack this is a mess we looked at who contributed to Lenox and most of the patches have been produced by programmers have only done one thing you can hear this distribution under that complaint and you can see why from this point of view that's a bad idea right we hired this program where you came in he drank our Cokes and play foosball for three years and have one idea right bad hire Pride. the cycle Mill question is was it a good idea what if it was a security patch what if it was a security patch for a buffer overflow exploit of which Windows has not some several do you want that patch but the fact that a single programmer can without having to move into a professional relation to an institution improve Linux once and never be seen from again should terrify bomber because this kind of value is unreachable in classic institutional Frameworks but he's part of Cooperative systems of Open Source software I'll file sharing out the Wikipedia I've used a lot of examples from Flickr but there are actually stories about this from all over meet up a service founded so that users could find people in their local area who share their interest in a senate is sand actually have a real world meeting offline in a cafe or a pub or what-have-you when Scott hifiman founded Meetup he thought it would be used for a train spotters. cat fanciers classic Affinity groups teens Ventures don't know what the invention is number one group on meet up right now most chapters in most cities with most members most active stay-at-home moms in the Suburban eyes dual income United States stay-at-home moms are actually missing the social infrastructure that comes from extended family and local small-scale neighborhoods so they are Reinventing it using these tools Meetup is the platform but the value here is in Social infrastructure you want to know what technology is going to change the world don't pay attention to 13 year old boys the young mothers because they have gotten not an ounce of support for technology that doesn't really make their lives better this is so much more important than Xbox but it's a lot less klitzing. I think this is a revolution front I think that this is a really profound change in the way human Affairs are arranged and I use that word advisedly it's a revolution in that it's a change in equilibrium write a whole new way of doing things which includes new down sights in the United States right now one named Judith Miller was in jail for not having given to a Federal grand jury purse or she's reported in your Contour sources in a very abstract and hard to follow case and journals are in the street rally and to improve the shield laws the shield laws are laws job pretty much a patchwork of state laws that prevent the journals from having to betray source. this is happening however against the background of the rise of web logging web logging is a classic example of mass amateur ization it is D profession wise publishing want to publish globally anything you think today is a one button operation that you can do for free right now that has sent the professional class of publishing down into the ranks of mass amateur ization until the shield law right as much as we want it right we want a professional plasti to tell is becoming increasingly incoherent because the institution is becoming incoherent there are people in the states right now tying themselves into knots trying to figure out whether or not bloggers are journalists and the answer to that question is that matter because that's not the wrong journalism was an answer to an even more important question which is how will Society be informed how will they share ideas and opinions and if there was an answer to that that happened. what are the professional framework of Journalism it makes no sense to take a professional metaphor and apply it to this distributed class so as much as we want the shield laws the background that the institution to which they were attached is becoming incoherent another example pro-ana the pro-ana groups these are groups of teenage girls who take a non web logs bulletin boards other kinds of Cooperative infrastructure support groups remaining anorexic by choice they post pictures of thin models which they called inspiration they have little slogans like salvation through starvation the even have Lance Armstrong style bracelets these red bracelet which signify in the small group I am I'm trying to maintain my eating disorder they trade tips like if you feel like getting something clean a toilet or the litter box the feeling will pass we're used to support groups being beneficial right we haven't added to the support groups are inherently beneficial. but it turns out that the logic of the support group is value-neutral a support group is simply a small group that wants to maintain a way of living in the context of a larger group is a bunch of drunks in a small group wants to stay sober then we think that's a great support group when the small group is teenage girls who want to stay anorexic by choice then were horrified what's happened is it the normative goals of the support group that were used to came from the institutions that we're framing them and not from the infrastructure once the infrastructure available the logic of the support group has been revealed to be accessible to anyone including people pursuing these kinds of goals so there are there are significant in the current environment want to need a load only lightly to at the work of of non-state actors trying to influence global Affairs and taking advantage of these this is a social map of the the hijackers nurse Associate's who purpose. are the the 9/11 attack was produced by analyzing their their Communications patterns using a lot of these tools and doubtless be the intelligence community's the world are doing the same work today for the tax of last week I tell you what's going to come as a result of all of this but I'm running out of time which is good cuz I don't know as with the printing press if it's really a revolution it doesn't take us from point A to point B takes us from point A to chaos the printing press precipitated 200 years of chaos moving from a world with a Catholic church with a sort of organizing political force to the Treaty of Westphalia when we finally knew what the new unit was the nation-state I'm not predicting two hundred years of chaos as a result of this. fifty fifty years in which Loosely coordinator groups are going to be given increasingly High leverage and the more of those groups for go traditional institution comparative like deciding in advance what's going to happen or if the profit motive the more leverage their God and institutions are going to come under increasing degree of pressure on the more rigidly managed and the more they were lying information monopolies the greater the pressure is going to be and that's going to happen one Arena at a time one institution at a time two forces are General but the results are going to be specific and so the point here is not this is wonderful or we're going to see if trans transition from only institutions to only Cooperative framework it's going to be much more complicated than that but the point is there's going to be a mass of Readjustment and since we can speed in advance and now it's coming my argument is essentially we might as well get good at it thank you very much",,
112,ClayShirky_2009S.sph.wav,is the largest increase in expressive capability in human history now that's a big claim i'm going to try to back it up there are only periods in the last five hundred years where media has changed enough to qualify for the label revolution the first one is the famous one then a couple of hundred years ago there was innovation in two way communication conversational media first the telegraph then the telephone slow text based conversations then real time voice then about one hundred and fifty years ago there was a revolution in recorded media other than print first photos then recorded sound about the transformed media landscape and what it means for anybody who has a message they want to get out to anywhere in the world and i want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories about that transformation i'll start here you want to have a conversation in this world you have it with one other person if you want to address a group you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press that was the media landscape as we had it in the twentieth century and this is what changed this thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen is bill cheswick 's map of the internet he traces the edges of the individual networks and then color codes the phone gave us the one to one pattern and television radio magazines books gave us the one to many pattern the internet gives us the many to many for the first time media is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations that's one of the big the second big change is that as all media gets digitized the internet also becomes the mode of carriage for all other media because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something can now gather around and talk to each other as well and the third big change is that members of the former audience as dan gilmore calls them can now also be producers and not consumers every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well because the same equipment phones computers let you consume and produce it's as if when you bought a book they threw in the printing press for free it's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio if you pressed the right last november there was a presidential election you probably read something about it in the papers and there was some concern that in some parts of the country there might be voter suppression that is a huge change in the media landscape we're used to and it's not just internet or no had the internet in its public form for almost twenty years now and it's still changing as the media becomes more social it's still changing patterns even among groups who know how to deal with the internet well second story last may china in the sichuan province had a terrible earthquake seven point nine magnitude massive destruction in a wide area as the richter scale has it and the earthquake was as it was happening people were texting from their phones they were taking photos of buildings they were taking videos of buildings shaking they were uploading it to qq china 's largest internet service they were twittering it and so as the quake was happening the news was reported and because of the social connections chinese students coming elsewhere and going to school the last time china had a quake of that magnitude it took them three months to admit that it had happened now they might have liked to have done that here rather than seeing these pictures go up online but they weren't given that choice because their own citizens beat them to the punch and so a plan came up to video the vote and the idea was that individual citizens with phones capable of taking photos or making video even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens rather than from the xinhua news agency and this stuff rippled like wildfire for a while there the top ten most clicked links on twitter the global short messaging service nine of the top ten links were about the quake people collating information pointing people to news sources pointing people to the us geological survey one was kittens on a treadmill but that's the internet for in those first hours and within half a day sites were up and donations were pouring in from all around the world this was an incredible coordinated global response and the chinese then in one of their periods of media openness decided that they were going to let it go that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly the reason so many school buildings collapsed is that corrupt officials had taken bribes to allow those building to be built to less than code would document their polling places on the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques and would upload this to a central place and that this would operate as a kind of in front of these protesters in order to get them to go away essentially to say we will do anything to placate you just please stop protesting but these are people who have been radicalized because thanks to the one child policy they have lost everyone in their next generation someone who has seen the death of a single child now has nothing to lose and so the protest kept going and finally the chinese cracked down that was enough of citizen media and so they began to arrest the protesters they began to shut down the media that the protests were happening china is probably the most successful manager of internet censorship in the world using something that is widely described as the great firewall of china and the great firewall of china is a set of observation points that assume that media is produced by professionals it mostly comes in from the outside world comes in in relatively sparse chunks and it comes in relatively slowly and because of those four characteristics they are able to filter it as it comes into the but like the maginot line the great firewall of china was facing in the wrong direction for this challenge because not one of those four things was true in this environment the media was produced locally it was produced by amateurs it was produced quickly and it was produced at such an incredible abundance that there was no way to filter it as it citizen observation that citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes and so now the chinese government who for a dozen years has quite successfully filtered the web is now in the position of having to decide whether to allow or shut entire services because the transformation to amateur media is so enormous that they can't deal with it any other they were simply shutting down access to twitter because there was no way to filter it other than that they had to turn the spigot entirely these changes don't just affect people who want to censor messages they also affect people who want to send messages because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole not just but also to help insure the sanctity of the vote overall so this is a pattern that assumes we're all in this together what matters here the classic media problem from the twentieth century is how does an organization have a message that they want to get out to a group of people distributed at the edges of a network and here is the twentieth century answer bundle up the message send the same message national message targeted individuals relatively sparse number of producers very expensive to do so there is not a lot of competition this is how you reach people all of that is over we are increasingly in a landscape where media is global social ubiquitous and cheap now most organizations that are trying to send messages to the outside world to the distributed collection of the audience are now to this change the audience can talk back and that's a little freaky but you can get used to it after a while as people do but that's not the really crazy change that we're living in really crazy change is here it's the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other the fact that former consumers are now producers the fact that the we saw some of the most imaginative use of social media during the obama campaign and i don't mean most imaginative use in politics i mean most imaginative use technical capital it's social capital these tools don't get socially interesting until they get technologically boring and one of the things obama did was they famously the obama campaign did was they famously put up my barak obama dot com mybo com and millions of citizens rushed in to participate and to try and figure out how to help an incredible conversation sprung up there and then this time last year obama announced that he was going to change his vote on the foreign intelligence surveillance act he had said in january that he would not sign a bill that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying on american by the summer in the middle of the general campaign he said i 've thought about the issue more i've changed my mind i'm going to vote for this bill and many of his own supporters on his own site went very publicly berserk it was senator obama when they created it they changed the name later please get fisa right within days of this group being created it was the fastest growing group on mybo com within weeks of its being created it was the largest obama had to issue a press release he had to issue a reply and he said essentially i have considered the issue i understand where you are coming from but thing happened in the conversation people in that group realized that obama had never shut them it isn't when the shiny new tools show up that their uses start permeating society it's when everybody is able to take them for granted nobody in the obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group or make it harder to join to deny its existence to delete it to take to off the site they had understood that their role with mybo com was to convene their supporters but not to control their and that is the kind of discipline that it takes to make really mature use of this media media the media landscape that we knew as familiar as it was as easy conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast messages to amateurs is increasingly slipping in a world where media is global social ubiquitous and cheap in a world of media where the former audience are now increasingly full participants in that world media is less and less often about crafting a single message to be consumed by individuals it is more and more often a way of creating an environment for convening and supporting groups and the choice we face i mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard anywhere in the world isn't whether or not that is the media environment we that's the media environment we've got the question we all face now is how can we make best use of this media even though it means changing the way we've always done it thank you very much because now that media is increasingly social innovation can happen anywhere that people can take for granted the idea,1,I want to talk about the transformed media landscape and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out to anywhere in the world no 1 illustrate that by telling a couple of stories about that transformation I'll start here last November there was a presidential election you probably read something about it in the papers and there was some concern that in some parts of the country there might be voter suppression and so a plan came up to video to vote and the idea was that individual citizens with with phones capable of taking photos making video would document their polling places on the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques to upload this to a central place that this would operate as a kind of citizen of observation that citizens would not be there just to cast individual vote also to help ensure the sanctity of the vote over all this is a pattern that is tsums We're All in This Together what matters here isn't technical capital. social tap these tools don't get socially interesting until they get technologically boring it isn't when The Shining new tools show up that they're used to start permeating Society it's when everybody is able to take them for granted because now the media is increasingly social Innovation can happen anywhere the people can take for granted the idea that we're all in this together we're starting to see a media landscape in which innovation is happening everywhere and moving from one spot that is a huge transformation. not to put too fine a point on it the moment we're living through the moment our historical generation is living through is the largest increase in expressive capability in human history that's a big plan I'm going to try and back it up there are only four periods in the last five hundred years when media has changed enough to qualify for the label Revolution the first one is the famous One the printing press with movable type oil based ink that whole complex of innovation that maid printing possible and turned Europe upside down starting the middle of the 14th it was a Novation in two-way communication conversational media first the Telegraph and the telephone slow text-based conversations then real-time voice becomes the other than Prince first photos then recorded sound than movies all encoded into physical objects finally about a hundred years ago the harnessing of the electromagnetic spectrum to send sound in the. just do the air radio and television this is the media landscape as we knew it in the 20th century this is what those of us of a certain age grew up with and are used to. curious face symmetry hear the media that's good at creating conversations is no good at creating groups and the media that's good at creating groups is no good at creating conversations you want to have a conversation in this world you have it with one other person if you want to address a group you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group while you're doing that with a broadcasting Tower or a printing press that was the media landscape as we had in the twentieth century what changed this thing that looks like a peacock and a windscreen is Bill cheswick's map of the internet he traces the edges of the individual networks and then color codes. the internet is the first meeting in history that has native support from groups and conversation at the same time where's the phone gave us the 121 pattern and television radio magazines books gave us the 12 many pattern gives us too many too many pain for the first time meeting is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversation that's one of the big the second picture is it is all media gets digital the internet also becomes the motive carriage for all other media meaning the phone calls my way to the internet magazines might go to the movies migrated to the internet and that means that every medium is right next door to every other medium. put another way media is increasingly last just a source of information is increasingly more a sight of coordination because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something can now gather around and talk to each other as well and is it members of the former audience is Dan gillmor also be producers and not consumers every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well because the same equipment phones computers let you consume and produce it's as if when you bought a book they threw in the printing press for free it's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio if you press the right buttons that is a huge change in the media landscape we're used to any to not just internet or no inner we've had the internet in his public forum for almost twenty years now and it's still changing as the media becomes more social it's still. changing pad even among groups who know how to deal with the internet. Second Story last men China this is one promise had a terrible earthquake 7.9 magnitude massive destruction in a wide area is the Richter scale. and the earthquake was reported as it was happening people were texting from their phones they were taking photos of buildings that were taking videos of buildings shaking their uploading it to QQ China's largest internet service they were wintering it and so as the Quake was happening the news was reported and because of the social Chinese students coming coming elsewhere and going to school or businesses and the rest of the World opening offices and they were people listening all over the world hearing this news the BBC got their first wind of the Chinese Quake from Twitter Twitter announced the existence of the Quake several minutes before the US Geological Survey had anything up online for anybody to. the last time China had a quake of that magnitude 3 months to admit that it had happened. nothing would have liked to have done that fear rather than seeing these pictures go up online choice because their own citizens beat them to the punch even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens rather than from the xinhua news agency and this stuff rippled like wildfire for a while there are the top 10 most click links on Twitter the global short messaging service nine of the top 10 list R about the quick people collating information pointing people to new sources pointing people to the US Geological Survey one was kittens on a treadmill but you know that's the internet for you but in those first hours and within half a day donation sites were up and donations were pouring in from all around the world this is an incredible coordinated Global Response in the Chinese media open this decided that they were going to let it go.. Let this this citizen reporting flap. people began to figure out in the Sichuan province that the reason so many school buildings had collapsed because tragically the earthquake happened during the school day the reason so many school buildings collapsed the corrupt officials have taken bribes to allow those buildings to be built to less than code and so they started the citizen Journal started reporting that as well sit on the front page New York Times a local official literally prostrated yourself in the street in front of these protesters in order to get them to go away to say we will do anything to placate you just please stop protesting in public. but these are people who've been radicalized because thanks to the one-child policy they have lost everyone in their next-generation someone who seen the death of a single child right now has nothing to lose and so the protest going in finally. the Chinese Crackdown that was enough of a citizen media and so they begin to arrest the protesters they begin to shut down the media that the protests were happening. China is probably the most successful manager of Internet censorship in the world using something that's why they described as the great firewall of China and the great firewall of China is a set of observation points that assumed that media has produced by professionals it mostly comes in from the outside world it comes in and relatively sparse chunks and it comes in relatively slowly because they are able to filter it as it comes into the country. but like the Maginot Line the great firewall of China was facing in the wrong direction for this challenge because not one of those four things was true in this environment the media was produced locally was produced by amateurs that was produced quickly and it was produced at such an incredible abundance that there was no way to filter it as it appeared and so now I'm trying to get my proof for a dozen years is quite successfully filtered the web is now in the position of having to decide whether to allow or shut down entire Services because the transformation to a mature media is so enormous that they can't deal with it any other way on the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen they just two days ago in that they were simply shutting down access to Twitter because there was no way to filter it other than that they had to turn. spigot entirely ball. let me change it. Don't just affect people who want to censor messages they also affect people who want to send message. because this is really a transformation ecosystem is a whole not just a particular strategy the classic media prop from the 20th century how does an organization have they want to get out to a group of people distributed at the edges not working here is the 20th century answer the message send the same message to everybody. National message targeted individuals relatively sparse number produces very expensive to do so there's not a lot of competition this is how you reach people. all of that is over we are increasingly a landscaper media is global social ubiquitous and cheap most organizations that are trying to send messages the outside wall to the distributed in the distributed collection of the audience to it after awhile it said people do it but that's not the really crazy chain that we're living in the middle of. really crazy changes here it's the fact that they're no longer disconnected from each other the fact that former consumers and producers the fact that the audience can talk directly to one another because there's a lot more amateurs and professionals and pick up the size of the network the complexity of the network is actually the square of the number of participants in the network when it grows large grows very very long as recently as last decade most of the media that was available for public consumption was produced by professionals. those days are over never to return it is the green lines now. we saw some of the most imaginative use of social media during the Obama campaign and I don't mean most imaginative use in politics I mean most imaginative use ever and one of the things Obama did was famously the Obama campaign did was they famously put up my barackobama.com my boh.com and millions of citizens rushed in to participate in to run up there and then this time last year Obama announced that he was going to change his boat on fights of the foreign intelligence surveillance act and said in January he would not sign a bill the granite Telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying on American person. by the summer in the middle of the general campaign he said I thought about the issue more I changed my mind I'm going to vote for this bill and then even own supporters on his own site when he's very publicly berserk it was Senator Obama when they created at they change the name later though right within days of this grouping creative is the fastest growing group on my bow. Come within weeks of its being created with the largest group and Obama had to issue a press release he had to issue a reply and I understand where you're coming from but having considered all I'm still going to vote the way I'm going to vote but I wanted to reach out to you and say I understand that you disagree with me and I'm going to take my lumps on this one. just going to please anybody but then. never shut them down nobody in the Obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group or make it harder to join to deny its existence to delete it to take it off the site they had understood that their rule with my bow. Comes to convene their supporters but not to control their supporters. that is the kind of discipline that it takes to make really mature use of this meeting. media the media landscape that we knew as familiar as it was as easy conceptually it was as it was to deal with the idea that professional broadcast messages to amateurs is increasingly slipping away. in a world where media is global social ubiquitous and cheap and world of meeting with former audience are now increasingly full participants in that will show me D is less and less often about crafting a single message to be consumed by individuals is more and more often a way of creating an environment for convening and supporting groups. and the choice we face I mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard anywhere in the world isn't whether that's the media environment we want to operate it that's the media environment we've got the question we all face now is how can we make best use of this meeting even though it means changing the way we've always done thank you very much,,
113,ClayShirky_2010S.sph.wav,that's all it is but that's all that's needed because what it does is it takes the tacit information available to the whole population everybody knows where the violence but no one person knows what everyone knows and it takes that tacit information and it aggregates it and it maps it and it makes it that that maneuver called crisis was kicked off in kenya in january of two thousand and eight and enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough the programmers who created ushahidi decided they were going to make it open source and turn it into a platform it's since been deployed in mexico to track electoral fraud it's been deployed in washington d c to track snow cleanup and it's been used most famously in haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake when you look at the map this went from a single idea and a single implementation in east africa in the beginning of two thousand and eight to a global deployment in less than three years the story starts in kenya in december of two thousand and seven when there was a disputed presidential election and in the immediate aftermath of that election what okolloh did would not have been possible without human generosity and the interesting moment now the number of environments where the social design challenge relies on both of those things being true that is the resource that i'm talking about i call it cognitive surplus and it represents the ability of the world 's population to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate on large sometimes global projects now that free time existed in the twentieth century but we didn't get ushahidi in the twentieth century that's the second half of cognitive surplus the media landscape in the twentieth century was very good at helping people consume and we got as a result very good at consuming but now that we've been given media tools the internet mobile phones that let us do more than consume what we're seeing is that people weren't couch potatoes because we liked to be we were couch potatoes because that was the only opportunity given to us we still like to consume of course but it turns out we also like to create and we like to share and it's those two things together ancient human motivation and the modern tools to allow that motivation to be joined up in large scale efforts that are the new and using cognitive surplus we're starting to see truly incredible experiments in scientific literary artistic political efforts designing we're also getting of course a lot of lolcats lolcats are cute pictures of cats made cuter with the addition of cute captions and they are also part of the abundant media landscape we're getting now this is one of the participatory one of the participatory models we see coming out of that along with there are other candidates of course but lolcats will do as a general case someone who has done something like this however mediocre and throwaway has tried something has put something forward in public and once they've done it they can do it again who began blogging about it on her site kenyan pundit and shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence the government suddenly imposed a significant media and they could work on getting it better there is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work and as anybody who 's worked as an artist or a creator knows it's a spectrum you're constantly struggling to get on top is between doing anything has already crossed over now it's tempting to want to get the ushahidis without the lolcats right to get the serious stuff without the throwaway stuff but media abundance never works that way so before i talk about what is i think the critical difference between lolcats and ushahidi i want to talk about their shared source and that source is design for generosity it is one of the curiosities of our historical era that even as cognitive surplus is becoming a resource we can design around social sciences are also starting to explain how important our intrinsic motivations are to us how much we do things because we like o do them rather than because our boss told us to do them or because we're being paid to do this a graph from a paper by uri gneezy and aldo rustichini who set out to test at the beginning of this decade what they called deterrence theory and deterrence theory is a very simple theory of human behavior you want somebody to do less of something add a punishment and they'll do less of it simple straightforward commonsensical also largely untested and so they went and studied ten daycare centers in haifa israel and they studied those daycare centers at the time of highest tension which is pick up time and so weblogs went from being commentary as part of the media landscape to being a critical part of the media landscape in trying to understand where the violence was pick up time the teachers who have been with your children all day would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back meanwhile the parents perhaps a little busy at work running late running errands want a little slack to pick the kids up daycare centers represented by the black line they said we are changing this bargain as of right now if you pick your kid up more than ten minutes late we're going to add a ten shekel fine to your bill boom no ifs ands or buts and the minute they did that the behavior in those daycare centers changed late pick ups went up a fine what they did was communicate to the parents that their entire debt to the teachers had been discharged with the payment of ten shekels and that there was no residue of guilt or social concern that the parents owed the teachers and so the parents quite sensibly said ten shekels to pick my kid up late what could and okolloh solicited the explanation of human behavior that we inherited in the twentieth century was that we are all rational self maximizing actors and in that explanation the daycare had no contract should have been operating without any constraints from her commenters more information about what was going on and the comments began pouring in and okolloh would collate them she would post them and she quickly said it 's too much i could do this all day every day and i can't keep up there is more but that's not right they were operating with social constraints rather than contractual ones and critically the social constraints created a culture that was more generous than the contractual constraints so gneezy and rustichini run this experiment for a a dozen weeks run the fine for a dozen weeks and then they say okay that's it all done fine really interesting thing happens nothing changes the culture that got broken by the fine stayed broken when the fine was removed not only are economic motivations and intrinsic motivations in designing these kinds of situations is to understand where you're relying on the lolcats and this is i think the range that matters both of these rely on cognitive surplus both of these design for the assumption that people like to create and we want to share is the critical difference between lolcats is communal value it's value created by the participants for each other is everywhere every time you see a large aggregate or shared publicly available data whether it's photos on flickr or videos on youtube or whatever this is good i like lolcats as much as the next guy maybe a little more even but this is also a largely solved problem i have a hard time envisioning a future in which someone is saying where oh where can i find a picture of a cute cat by contrast is civic value it's value created by the participants but enjoyed by society as a whole the goals set out by ushahidi are not just to make life better for the participants but to make life better for everyone in the society in which ushahidi is operating and that kind of civic value is not just a side effect of opening up to human motivation it really is going to be a side effect of what we collectively make of these kinds of there are hours a year of participatory value up for grabs that will be true year in and year out the number of people who are going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects is going to grow and we can see that organizations designed around a culture of generosity can achieve incredible effects without an enormous amount of contractual overhead a very different model than our default model for large scale group action in the twentieth century going to make the difference here what dean kamen said the inventor and entrepreneur kamen said free cultures get what they celebrate we've got a choice before us we've got this trillion hours a year we can use it to crack each other up and we're going to do that that we get for free in seventy two hours they launched ushahidi ushahidi the name means witness or testimony in swahili is a very simple way of taking reports from the field whether it's from the web or critically via mobile phones and sms aggregating it,1,the story starts in Kenya in December of 2007 when there was a disputed presidential election in the immediate aftermath of that election and there was an outbreak of ethnic violence and there was the lawyer in Nairobi oriya chora who some of you may know from her tedtalk who began blogging about it on her site Canyon pundit and shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence the government sent me pose a significant media blackout it's a web logs went from being commentary as part of the media landscape to being a critical part of the media landscape in trying to understand where the violence was solicited from her commenters more information about what was going on in the comments began pouring in in a cold to collate them she would post them and she quickly said it's too much I could do this all day everyday and I can't keep up there was more information about what's going on in Kenya right now than any one person can manage if only there was a way to. automate this into programmers who read her blog held her hands up and said we could do that and he's seventy-two hours they lost ushahidi you should he do the name means witness or testimony in Swahili is a very simple way of taking reports from the field whether is from the web or for critically be a mobile phones in SMS aggregating it and put it on a map that's all it is but that's all that's needed because when it does it take the tacit information available to the whole population everybody knows where the violence is but no one person knows what everyone takes that tested information and aggregated and it Maps it and it makes it public and that that maneuver called crisis map was kicked off in Kenya in January 2008 and enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough that the programmers who created you she he decided they're going to make it open source and turn it into a platform. it's since been deployed in Mexico to track electoral fraud it's been deployed in Washington d.c. to track snow cleanup and has been used most famously in Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake. when you look at the map now posted on you Shady front page you can see that the number of deployments and you should he has gone worldwide. this went from a single idea and a single implementation in East Africa in the beginning of 2008 to a global deployment in less than 3 years. know what a cola did would not have been possible without digital technology. what a college ID would not have been possible without human generosity and now the number of environment where the social design challenge relies on both of those things being true dad is the resource that I'm talking about I call it cognitive Surplus and it represents the ability of the world's population to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate on large sometimes Global projects the first obviously is the world's free time and talents the world has over a trillion hours a year of free time to commit to Shared projects that's the second half of cognitive Surplus the me landscape for the twentieth century was very good at helping people consume and we got as a result very good at consuming but now that. I've been giving media tools the internet mobile phones but let us do more than consume what we're seeing is that people weren't couch potatoes because we liked to be we work at potatoes because that was the only opportunity given to us we still like the consume of course but it turns out we also like to create and we like to share and it's those two things together ancient human motivation and the modern tools to allow that motivation to be joined up in large-scale efforts that are the new the new design resource and using cognitive Surplus we're starting to see truly incredible experiments in scientific literary or artistic political efforts designing we're also getting of course a lot of log cats all cats are cute pictures of cats made cuter with the addition of cute captions and they are also part of the Abundant media landscape we're getting now this is this is one of the participatory. one of the participatory model we see coming out along with your shake it out there are other candidates of course that blog cats will do as a general case the stupid as possible created back is still a creative act like someone who is done something like this however mediocre and throw away has tried something has put something forward in public and once they've done it they can do it again and they can work on getting it better if there was a spectrum between mediocre working good work and is anybody who has worked as an artist or a Creator knows it's a spectrum you're constantly struggling to get on top of the Gap is between doing anything and doing nothing but someone who makes a wild cat has already crossed over that cat. attempting to want to get the ushahidi without the law cast right to get the serious stuff without the throwaway stuff but media abundant never works that way freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything even with the sacred printing press we got a rhotic novels 150 years before we got scientific journals. rather than Focus right now so before I talk about what is I think the critical difference between lol cats and you should he I want to talk about their shared source and that source is designed for generosity it is one of the Curiosities of our historical era that even as cognitive Surplus is becoming a resource we can design a rat social sciences are also starting to explain how important our intrinsic motivation Zar to us how much we do things because we like to do them rather than because our boss told them to do them or because we're being paid to do. this is a graph from paper by urine easy enough to rate a rooster Cheney who set out to test at the beginning of this decade what they call deterrence Theory and it turns there's a very simple theory of human behavior do you want someone to do lots of something at a punishment and they'll do less of a simple straightforward commonsensical let me study those daycare centers at the time of highest tension which is pickup time at pickup time and teachers who have been with your children all day would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back meanwhile the parents perhaps a little busy at work running late running errands want a little slack to pick the kids up late so how many instances of late pickups are there at least 10 Dickerson's late arrivals. and 10 instances of late pickups on average in Houston day care centers and the white group there is the exposure control group they change nothing cuz the group of take care centers represented by the black line they said we are changing this bargain as of right now if you pick your kid up more than 10 minutes late we're going to add a ten shekel find your hands are butts and the minute they did that the behavior in those daycare centers changed late pickups went up every week for the next four weeks until they topped out at triple the predefined average and then they fluctuated between double and triple the pre find average for the life of the fun. really what happened right Define broke the culture of the daycare center by adding a fine what they did was communicate to the parents that their entire deck to the teachers had been discharged with the payment of tension and there was no residue of guilt or social concern that the parents do the teachers that's what the parents quite sensibly said 10 shuttles to pick my kid up late what could be.. the explanation of human behavior that we inherited in the twentieth century was a we are all rational self maximizing actors in an explanation at the daycare center had no contract should have been operating without any constraints but that's not right they were operating with social constraints rather than contractual one and critically the social constraints created a culture that was more generous than the contractual constricted weeks run the run the fine for dozen weeks and then it really interesting thing happened nothing changes the culture that got broken by the fine Steed broken when the sign was removed not only our economic motivations and intrinsic motivation incompatible that income. edibility Kendall persist over long. So the trick right in designing these kinds of situations is to understand where you're relying on the economic part of the bargain as with it the parents paying the teachers and when you're relying on the social part of the bargain when you're really designing for generosity this brings me back to the log cats and do you see he this is a think the range that matters both of these rely on cognitive Surplus both of these designs the assumption that people like to create and we want to share here is a critical difference between the Explorer. what cats is communal value its value created by the participants for each other communal value on the Network's we have is is everywhere every time you see a large aggregate of shared publicly available data whether it's photos on Flickr or videos on YouTube or whatever this is good I like log cats as much as the next guy maybe a little more but this is also a largely solve problem I have a hard time envisioning a future in which someone is saying where or where can I find a picture of a cute cat. you should Key by contrast is Civic value its value created by the participants been enjoyed by society as a whole the goals set out by Yoshi Haley are not just to make life better for the participants but to make life better for everyone in the society in which you should he is operating and that kind of Civic value is not just a side effect of opening up to human motivation it really is going to be a side effect of what we collectively make of these kinds of apples. there are a trillion hours a year of participatory value up for grabs that will be true year in and year out the number of people who are going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects is going to grow and we can see that organizations designed around a culture of generosity could achieve incredible effects without an enormous amount of contractual overhead a very different model than our default model for large-scale group action the 20th century. what's going to make the difference here is what Dean Kamen said the inventor and entrepreneur and said three cultures get what they celebrate we got a choice before us we've got this trillion hours a year we can use it to crack each other up and we're going to do that that we get for free but we can also celebrate and support and reward the people trying to use cognitive Surplus to create Civic value and to the green we're going to do that to the green that were able to do that we'll be able to change the side thank you very much. investment in Broadband high-speed internet can help small businesses create new American jobs small businesses are being formed dreams are being launched and it AT&T we're investing billions to upgrade and build out our wired and wireless networks now is not the time to stall momentum or stifle Innovation or investment jobs dreams and the future are at stake AT&T you are World delivered,,
114,CliffordStoll_2006.sph.wav,second book nor am i going to talk about why i believe computers don't belong in schools when they cast bells they write inscriptions on them so i wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells and i look at it i'm asking myself why am i here so at this time i'd like to tell you the words inscribed upon the hayes hall tower bells all truth is one in science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind from darkness to light from narrowness to broad mindedness from prejudice to tolerance i feel that there's a massive and the argument is so obvious to anyone who 's hung around a fourth grade classroom doesn't need much talking about but i guess i may be very wrong about that and everything else that i've said so don't go back and read my dissertation it probably has lies in it as well said that i outlined my talk about five minutes ago and if you look at it over here the main thing i wrote on my thumb was the future i'm supposed to talk about the future yes right and my feeling is asking me to talk about the future is bizarre because i've got gray hair and so it's kind of silly for me to talk about the future in fact here i'm honored by the invitation and thanks i would love to talk about stuff that i'm interested in but unfortunately i suspect that what i'm interested in won 't interest many other people i think that if you really want to know what the future 's going to be if you really want to know about the future ask a technologist a scientist a physicist no don't ask somebody who 's writing code no if you want to know what society 's going to be like in twenty years in fact don't ask just any kindergarten teacher ask an experienced one the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation i nor i suspect do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring certainly all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there to me things aren't the future i ask myself is what's society is going to be like the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on screen time never gone bowling together happening and the change that is happening is not one that is in software but going to talk about i'd love to talk about it it 'd be fun but i want to talk about what i'm doing now what am i doing now oh the other thing that i think i'd like to talk about is right over here right over here is that visible what i'd like to talk is one sided things i would dearly love to talk about things that have one side because i love mobius loops i not only love mobius loops but i'm one of the very few people if not the only person in the world that makes klein bottles right away i hope that all of your eyes glaze over this is a klein bottle first off my badge says i'm an astronomer i would love to talk about my astronomy for those of you in the audience who know you roll your eyes and say yup i know all about it it's one sided it's a bottle whose inside is its outside it has zero volume and it's non orientable it has wonderful properties if you take two mobius loops and sew their common edge together you get one of these and i make them out of glass and i'd love to talk to you about this but i don't however the d in ted of course stands for design just two weeks ago i made you know i've been making small medium and big klein bottles for the trade but but i suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer in non gray atmospheres and polarization of light in jupiter 's upper atmosphere are the number of people who 'd fit in a bus shelter so what i've just made and i'm delighted to show you first time in public here this is a klein bottle wine although in four dimensions it shouldn 't be able to hold any fluid at all it's perfectly capable of doing so because our universe the cool one that was a month of my life although i would love to talk about topology i'm not going to going to mention my away last summer had collected photographs of me as mothers will do and i looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me standing well sitting in to talk about that it sent me back soon after that i found in another picture that she had a picture of me over here of course is me this man is robert moog the inventor of the moog synthesizer who passed away this past august robert moog was a generous kind person it would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened a musician who took time from his life to teach me a sophomore a freshman at suny buffalo he'd come up from trumansburg mentoring me he'd come up and spend hours and hours with me he wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school bob 's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us anyone who 's a musician has been profoundly influenced by say what i'm about to do what i'm about to do i hope you can recognize a distorted sine wave almost a triangular wave upon this hewlett packard i can get to this place over here right kids kids is what i'm going to talk about is that okay it says kids over here that's what i'd like to talk about for me at least i don't have a big enough head so i think locally and i act locally i feel that the best way i can help out i caught the guys and they turned out to be working for what was then the soviet kgb and stealing information and selling it and i'd love to talk about that and it is to help out very very locally so ph d this and degree there and the how come you ain't over here on the front lines i strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do not just show up to class every now and then teach a solid week okay i'm teaching three quarters time but one of the things that i've done for my science students is to tell them look i'm going to teach you but twenty years with my help of course and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope measured the speed of light we were off by twenty five percent how many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light in addition to that we've measured the speed of sound i'd love to measure the speed of light here i was all set to do it and i was thinking aw man i was just going to impose upon the powers that be and measure the speed of light and i'm all set to do it i'm all set to do it but then it turns out that to set up here later i find computer security frankly to be kind of boring it's tedious could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation and all of you know the wave equation is of any wave is a constant when the frequency goes up the wavelength comes down wavelength goes up frequency goes down if we have a wave here over here that's what's interesting what they didn't tell you in physics in eighth grade physics but they should have and i wish they had was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound or light you get a constant and that constant is the speed of sound the first time you do something is know its frequency well that's easy i've got a frequency counter right here set it up to around a above a above a there's an a more or less now so i know the frequency it's one point seven six it's science the second time it's engineering need now is to flip on another beam and the bottom beam is me talking right so anytime i talk you'd see it on the screen over here and as i move this away from the source you'll notice the spiral the slinky moves we're going through different nodes of the wave coming out this way those of you who are physicists i hear you rolling your eyes but bear with me to measure the wavelength all i need to do is measure the distance from here one full wave over to here from here to here is the wavelength of sound so i'll put a third time it's just being a technician here here let 's go back to mister the frequency is one point seven six kilohertz or one thousand seven hundred and sixty the wavelength was zero point two meters let 's figure out what this is do something i do something else one point seven six zero point two over here is three hundred and fifty two meters per second if you look it up in the book it's really three hundred and forty three but here with kludgy material and lousy drink to measure the speed of sound to comes to what i wanted to say go back to this picture of me a million years ago and i'm like oh my god i'm studying physics landau lipschitz resnick and halliday i'm going home for a midterm a riot 's going on there's a riot going on on campus and the police are chasing me i'm walking across campus cop comes and looks at me and says you you're a student and a tear gas canister the size of a pepsi i go running across campus quick as i can i duck into behind me climb up go past this place where i see a pendulum ticking and i'm thinking oh yeah the square root of the length is proportional to its period i keep climbing up go back i go to a place where a dowel splits off there's a clock clock clock clock the time 's going backwards because i'm inside of it i'm thinking of lorenz contractions and i climb up and there's this place way in the,1,diamond white and beat her I'm honored by the invitation and then I would love to talk about stuff that's I'm interested in but unfortunately I suspect that what I'm interested in will entrust many other people first off my badge says I'm an astronomer I would love to talk about my astronomy but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer 9 grey atmospheres and polarization of light in Jupiter's upper atmosphere your number people turn into a black shelter so I'm not going to talk about that. want to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987 when a computer hackers breaking into our systems over at Lawrence Berkeley lab sand and I caught the guys and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB in stealing information and selling it and then I'd like to talk about that. 20 years 20 years later I find computer security frankly to be kind of boring it's tedious. the first time you do something it's the second time it's engineering once I do something I'll do something else. you talk about what I think are obvious statement from my first book silicon steak well what were the second one and nor am I going to talk about why I believe computers don't belong in school I feel that there is a massive in bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into school and keep them out of school and I'd love to talk about this but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who is hung around a fourth grade classroom that doesn't need much talking about but I guess I may be very wrong about that and everything else that I've said so don't go back and read my dissertation probably his lies and it is well. about 5 minutes ago and if you look at it over here my feeling is asking asking me to talk about the future it's. is bizarre because I got gray hair and the end and so it's it's kind of silly for me to talk about the future in fact I think that if you really want to know what the future is going to be if you really want to know about the future don't ask but technologist the scientist the physicist know. do that somebody's writing code. know if you want to know what Society is going to be like in 20 years ask a kindergarten teacher they know. in fact don't just ask any kindergarten teacher asked inexperienced one they're the ones who know what's society's going to be like in another generation I don't. nor I suspect do many other people who are talk to you about what the future will bring certainly all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there but to me things aren't the future when I ask myself is what Society going to be like when. kids are the kids today are phenomenally go to text messaging and then spend a huge amount of on the screen time but. have never done bowling together changes happening in and the changes happening is not one that's in soccer but I want to talk about what I'm doing that what am I doing other things that I think I'd like to talk about the right over here over here. what to talk about is one-sided things I would. love to talk about things that have one side because. the flu. one of the very few people not the only person for those who know nothing in the audience to know you roll your I said yep I know all about it it's one-sided it's a bottle who's inside is it outside in 20 volume and it's it's not a priest if you take that you get one of these and I make them out of class and and and I'd like to talk to you about this but I don't. watching The Wave. things to say because the D the D in Ted of course it stands for design just two weeks ago I made the making small medium and big wine bottles for the trade but what what I've been what I just made and I'm delighted to show you first time in public here. wine bottle wine bottle. which although it shouldn't in four dimensions it shouldn't be able to hold any fluid at all is perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial Dimensions because the universe is only three spatial dimensions. that one's the cool one that was a month of my life but. although I would love to talk about topology with with you I'm not going to. I'm going to mention my my mom who passed away. had collected photographs of me as mothers will do and I looked over her and she collected a picture of me standing while sitting in 1969 in front of a bunch of dials. and I looked at me when I was working at the electronic music studio as a technician repairing and maintaining electronic music studio wow Wayback machine and I said to myself. and set me back. soon after that soon after that I found in another picture that she had a picture of me this guy over here of course is me this man is Robert Moog the inventor of the Moog synthesizer who passed away this past August Robert Moog with a generous kind person extraordinary competent engineer a musician who took time from his life to teach me to Trumansburg to teach me about. not talk about it don't get caught up in the electronic music if you're doing physics. he wrote a letter of recommendations for me to get into graduate school. in the background my bicycle I realize that this picture was taken at a friend's Living Room 5 mode came by and brought up all the whole pile equipment to show Greg fluid tonight things about this we sat around talking about forms Bethel functions modulation transfer function stuff like this. Bob's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us anyone who's the musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert phone and. I'll just say what I'm about to do. what I'm about to do I hope you can recognize that there's a distorted sine wave almost a triangular Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope. I can get two I can get to this place over here right kids kids is what I'm going to talk about that okay it says kids over here I decided that for me at least I don't have a big enough head so I think locally and I act locally I feel that the best way I can help out anything just help out locally so PhD degree. I was talking about the stuff to some school teachers about a year ago and one of them would come up to me and says well how come you did you're so with the kids and all the stuff how come you ain't over here on the front lines. put your money where your mouth is. is true is true I teach 8th grade science 4 days a week lunch hour teach a solid week teaching three-quarter-time but. good enough what are the things I've done for my science students has to tell them look I'm going to teach you college level physics know calculus you won't need to know what you will need to know algebra and we're going to do series experiments none of this open to chapter 7 and do all the problems that we're going to be doing genuine physics and that's one of the things I saw I do right now before you turn that on one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my classroom for my students in El Cerrito and with my help of course and the help of a very beat up oscilloscope measure the speed of light we are off by 25% how many 8th graders do you know of the measured the speed of light in addition to that we can measure the speed of sound or the speed of light here. I'm all set to do it but then it turns out that the set up here you have like 10 minutes to set up next time I'll measure the speed of light or the speed of sound or the speed of sound at the look at the echo but probably one of my students said could we measure the speed of light using the weight equation and all of you know the wave equation is the frequency. time for wavelength of a wave is a constant when the frequency goes up comes down it goes up if we have. a way to hear it over here. as a pitch goes up things you're closer goes down then you stretch out. write a simple physics all of you know this for Maze Craze remember. what they didn't tell you what they didn't tell you in physics in eighth grade physics but they should have and I wish they had was that if you multiply the frequency times the length of a sound or light you got a constant in that constant is the speed of sound so in order to measure the speed of sound all I've got to do is frequency I've got to set up to around more or less. for know the frequency 1.76 khz its wavelength all I need now is to flip on another beam in the bottom beam is me talking right now so anytime I talk you see it on the screen yeah. I'll put it over here. in as I move this away from the source you'll notice. Wireless linking moves we're seeing where we're going through different nodes of. avoid coming out that way those of your physicists I hear you rolling your eyes are with me to measure the wavelength. measure the wavelength of all I need to do is measure the distance from here. that one full wave over here from here to here is the wavelength of sound so I'll put a. measuring tape here. measuring tape here move it back over here I'd move the microphone. 40 cm to M from here. okay let's go back to mr. Elmo. we'll see the frequency is 1.76 khz or 1760 the wavelength was 0.2 m. let's figure out what this is. 1.76. times 0.2 over here is 352 m per second if you look at the book yeah it's really really 304 reel in slowly drink we've been able to measure the speed of light to pull the speed of sound to not bad pretty good. all of which comes to what I wanted to say. go back to this picture of me a million years ago. it was 1971 and the Vietnam War I'm like oh my God that's going on on the right. there's a riot going on in campus in the police are chasing me right across campus your gas canister the size of a Pepsi can. I can't breathe. Comes after me with a rifle over the head to clear out here one quick as I can get into. he's Hall it's what he's bell tower building stop chasing me chased me up the 1st floor and 2nd floor it's the entrance way to the Bell Tower by slam the door behind me climb up at the place where I see a pendulum ticking and I think you know yet where do the length of proportion to his. I keep climbing up back inside it has contractions and einsteinian relativity. and there's this place we're in the back that you climb up this wooden ladder I pop up the top and there's a pool plug going with he's 10 ft don't know what am I doing here why am I here. remember what my English teacher high school when you spell the word inscription time them the belt and I look at it I'm asking myself why am I here. so this time. I'd like to tell you the words inscribed upon his hotel window. bald truth. is 1. in this light. met science and religion. Endeavor here for the study of Lucien of mankind from Darkness to light from they're honest from Prejudice to tolerance. it is the voice of Life which calls us. to come and learn. thank you very much. traffic is a global epidemic traffic is creating 45% of a while to air pollution in the UK time wasted in traffic cost 20 billion a year would you place a clean the round with a false the commute Stockholm put it to a vote I voted for it. how to do something install come to improve the environment and to get the better of a flow in the traffic will put a price on taking your car into the center part of stock on a cold that congestion charges. if your self assistant assistant doesn't work on the first day then you will be in big trouble it must be perfect from Davon. there are teaching them tickets to the city each is equipped with cameras on the rear and front license plates these pictures are sent to Central system that identifies the license plates and make sure that the right person pays for the right passages to read the license plate we went out IBM's Global organization and the R&D centres and find a very good software we could use a way to manage p.m. to mount it in two months time ninety-nine percent of old pictures are correct identified. nice guys this is how it should be all the time. See the traffic of the truck is 6 p.m. before we have the congestion charge in the traffic was chewing up at this time of day it is I think it's a good idea because I think that we should take care of the environment in the CD is about 40% better it is huge International interest from different parts of the world from the United States from Latin America from China and its really pretty sure to tell people no problem. Planning to do what we're actually have done install come she is not thinking like me for. I'm thinking for the children and their grandchildren,,
115,CorneilleEwango_2007G.sph.wav,story i suspect a lot of people here have the same question i have how can we i did it myself if i know when i was young that killing elephant i'm destroying biodiversity i would not many many of you have seen the talents of africans but there are few who are going to school to biomedical science to be a doctor i didn't succeed i was having my inscriptions my admission to biology many are dying because of all those kind of pandemics hiv malaria poverty not going to school but many of them are just here because they don't have money and they can't go even to university and i said no way i'm not doing it my family 's poor my area don't have better health care i want to be a doctor that means three years and i start getting old i say oh no i continue so i did tropical ecology and plant botany when i finished i went to ituri forest for my internship it's where i really getting passion with what i'm doing right english i start speaking english learning english about a year ago i speak french and i grew up with french so my english is franglais now i'm standing in front of you doing botany and wildlife conservation that time the ituri forest was created as a forest reserve and also plants and the training center there was built around the scientific congolese staff and so the okapi faunal reserve protects number i think that is the largest number of elephant we have right now in protected area in congo it has also chimpanzees and it okapi faunal reserve because of this beautiful creature that is a forest giraffe i think you guys know it quite well here we have giraffe but through evolutions we have this forest giraffe that it has also some beautiful primates thirteen species highest diversity we can find in one single area in africa and it has the ituri forest itself about one thousand teaching assistant at my university because i accomplished with honor but i didn't like the i got was very poor and i wanted to be from to a training center and a research center with the end of was completely difficult to do and to achieve when kabila started his movement to liberate congo so mobutu soldiers started in the western congo in an area around here and then went to university in kisangani moving and retreated so they started fleeing from the east to the west and the okapi faunal reserve is so there was a road from goma somewhere here and coming like this so they might go through pass through okapi faunal reserve congo has five of sites of protected area and okapi faunal reserve is one of them so soldier was fleeing in the okapi faunal reserve way they looted everything torture wars oh my god you can't believe every person was looking his way where to go we don't know and it was for us young the first time really we hear the language of what was happening they were killing people they were doing whatever they want because they have power who have been doing that young children child soldiers you can't ask him how old he is because he has guns but i was from the west working in the east i even that time was not speaking and after i finished i went to this area the ituri forest but what i've been doing when i was about fourteen and when they came they looted everything you can't speak lingala because lingala was from mobutu and everyone speaking lingala is soldier and i was from the same area my friends said we are leaving because we are a target but i'm not going to the east because there i don't know swahili i if i go i will be killed i can't go back to my area it's more than one thousand kilometers i stayed after they looted everything we have been doing research on botany and we have a small herbarium of four thousand five hundred sheets of plants we cut we dry and we packed them we mounted them on a so that we start them for agriculture for medicine for whatever and for science the study of the flora and the change of the forest that is people moving around that's even pygmies and this is a bright guy person and pygmies i've been working with him about ten years and with soldiers they went to the forest for know how to track elephant in the forest he have been attacked by leopard and they abandon him in the forest they came to told me and what i did i gave him just antibiotics that we care for that tuberculosis and fortunately i grew in my uncle 's house and my father was a soldier and my uncle was a fisherman and so on and what of important things i think all of you here have killed a lot five millions of congolese have gone because of that they use it to make cell phone and it have been in that area all over in congo extraction and good big business of the and what i did for the first war after we have lost everything i have to save something even myself my life and life of the staff i buried some of our new vehicle engine i buried it to save it and some of equipment went with them on the top of the canopy to save it he 's not collecting plants he 's going to save our equipment with the material that's left because they wanted to destroy it to burn it they didn't understand it they didn't go to school it and that is me going to hurrying to uganda try to save that four thousand material with people them on the bikes bicycles and after that we succeeded i housed that four thousand material the herbarium of makerere university and after the war i have been able to bring it back home so that also a poacher what i've been doing from fourteen to seventeen was i was assisting the second war came while we didn't expect it with friends we have been sitting and watching match football and having some good music with when it started i think so it was so bad we heard that now from the east again and it's going fast this time i think kabila will go in place of as he did with mobutu and the reserve was that's the powerful men we have to meet and to talk to them what's the regulation of the reserve and what is the regulation of the parks and they can't do what they are doing so we went to meet them that is gold mining so we started talking with them convincing them that we are in a protected area there is regulations that it's prohibited to do logging mining and poaching specifically we don't think so we have to do it because to let our movement advance i say no way you are not going to do it here we started talking with them and i was negotiating tried to protect our equipment tried to protect our staff and the villages of about one thousand five hundred people and we continued but i was doing that negotiating with them sometimes we are having meeting and they are talking with and whatever they were killing poaching hunting in the forest bring it in the main city to get access to the and i'm there sometimes they talk to my own language that is lingala i hear it and what strategy they are doing what they are planning sometimes they are having helicopter to supply them with ammunition and so on they used me to and i was doing counting what comes from where and where and where i this equipment my satellite phone my computer and a plastic that i hide it in the forest and every time daily after we have meeting what we have whatever i go i write a short email send it i don't know how many people i my address i sent the message what is going about the progress of the war and what they are planning to do they started suspecting that what we do on the morning and the afternoon it's on the news bbc rfi something might be going on and one day we went for we went to meet the chief commander he had the same iridium cell phone like me and he asked me do you know how to use this i said i have never i don't know and i had mine on my pocket so it was a chance that they trusted me a lot they didn 't they was on me so i was scared and when we finished the meeting i went to return it in the forest and i was but finally i got myself involved around seventeen to twenty years i became sending news doing whatever reporting daily to u n to unesco to our institution in new york the first two rebellions they killed all animals in the zoo we have a zoo of fourteen okapis and one of them was pregnant and during the war after a week of heavy war fighting in the area we succeeded we had the first okapi this is the only trouser and after a week we celebrated the birthday of that okapi they killed elephant just fifty meters area where the zoo where okapi was born and i was mad i oppose it that they are now going to dissect it until i do my report and then i see the chief commander and i succeeded the elephant just decayed and what we are doing after that that was the situation of the some money i was paid one hundred and fifty dollars i to rebuild the herbarium because we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants wildlife conservation society more dealing with plants i started this with seventy dollars and start fundraising money to where i've been going i had opportunity to go all over where herbarium for my african material is and they supported me a bit and i built this now it's doing work to train young congolese and also what one of the speciality we are doing my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity and what the impacts of the ituri forest is uptake carbon this is one of the study we are doing on forty hectares plot where we have to see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions and that is i think it's difficult for me this is a very embarrassing talk i know i don't know where to start where to finish it when i was thinking to come here you people now we are talking about reconstitution rebuild africa but is gun industries a tool to is it a game i think we even so i did it and for three to four years i went to university for three times i see the war like a game like soccer football everybody is happy but see what it's doing see what going in darfur now we say oh my god see what the wars in rwanda that's because of the language of guns i don't think that someone may blame google,1,"I don't speak English I start speaking English learning English about a year ago I speak French and I grew up with French so my English is Frank. I'm born in the western condo in area around here and then went to University in kisangani and after I finished I went to this area had a tree Forest that's what I've been doing when I was about 14. I grew in my uncle house and my father was a soldier and my uncle was a fisherman and also a purchase what I've been doing from 14 to 17. I was assisting them collecting Ivory task. a meat and what do they do with killing Fortune hunting in the forest bring it in the main city to get access to the market. finally I got myself involved around 17 to 20 years I became a self portrait. and I want you to do it because I believed to continue my studies I want you to go to university but my father was for my uncle isn't so I did it and 325 40 years I went to University for free times I applied to be biomedical science to be a doctor I didn't succeed my inscription smash mission to biology and I said no I'm not doing it my family my area don't have better health care I want to be a doctor to save them. three times that means three years and I start getting old I see you know how I continue so I did tropical ecology and plant botany. when I finished I went to you to Deforest for my internship is where I really get in fashion with what I'm doing right up to now I'm standing in front of you doing but in the end what law of conservation. that time the 31st was created as a Forest Reserve with Sam and a mixed animals and plants and the training center was built around today scientific stuff and some American scientist also so that is the largest number of elephant we have right now in protected area in Congo and because of this beautiful creature that is a forest giraffe I think you guys you know it quite well here we have seven but evolution this Photograph that lives only in Congo. he has also some beautiful primates 13 species is diversity we can found in one single area in Africa itself about 1,300 species of plants so far none I joined it what law conservation Society working there in 1995 but I started working with them as a student in 1991 I was a teaching assistant at my university cuz I did I accomplished with an hour but I didn't like the way the expression I got was very poor and I wanted to pay phone to a training center and the research with the end of dictatorship we know that most of you know. life became very very difficult and what we have been doing was completely Dakota to do and to achieve it when it's fully bright or so and retreated so they started fleeing from the East to the west and look up your phone or Reserve is there. so there was a road from a coma somewhere here and coming like this so they might go through faster Okapi phone or Reserve has five of world heritage site of protected area and Ochopee phone or Reserve is one of them was flowing in the reserve on their way they looted everything oh my God I can't believe. every person he was looking is wait where to go if you don't know and it was for us young the first time really is the language of War of guns and even people who faced the rebellion of 1963 after our independence the genius believe what was happening before they were doing what you want because they have power we've been doing that young children has gone but I was from the West working in the East given that time was not speaking Swahili and when they came they look at everything you can speak later because dinner was from Mobutu and if you weren't speaking English Soldier and I was from the same area 2 in on my friend said we are leaving because we are at Target but I'm not going today. because they're I don't know Swahili I stay if I go I will detail it go back to my area it's more than thousand kilometers I stayed after they looted everything. we have been doing research on Britney and we have a smart and barium of 4500 sheets of plants we got to be dry and we packed them we Mount them on a full day. We start them for agriculture formation for what is that and for science for the start of the Florida and the change of the forest that these people are moving around now it's even pygmies and this is a bright guy at work in person and pygmies I've been working with him about 10 years and we've soldiers they went to the forest for poaching elephants because his big Mills in know how to track elephant in the forests have been attacked by and no Park ended abandoned in the forest they came to tell me I have to save him and what I did I give you antibiotics that we care for that. tuberculosis and fortunately I saved his life. that's what was the language of the war everywhere they have been constant extraction of mineral killing animals looking Timbers and so on and what important things I think all of you are out of a cell phone that might have killed a lot 55 millions of Congolese have gone because of this Columbus and Toledo College Colton. that they use it to to to match cell phone and it should have been in that area all over in Congo extraction and good big business of the world. what they did for the first war after we have lost everything I have to say something even myself my life and life of the stuff I bought it some of our new vehicle engine I bought it it to save it and some of the equipment went with them on the top of the canopy to save it is not collecting plant is going to save our equipment Monday, and that left because they wanted to destroy to burn if you didn't understand it did you need to go to school I passed it and that is me going to be heading to Uganda try to save that 4000 material with people getting them on the bicycle and I always eat that 4000 material at the bedroom of my credit University and after the word I've been able to bring it back home so that we continue our studies. while we didn't expect it with friends who have been sitting and watching match football and having some good music with World space radio when it starts because I think so bad with that no from the East again the worst at it and it's going fast this time I think I did I will go in place of as you did with my boot and there is there was Target to the rebels three different movements and two acting in the same area and competing for natural resources and there was no way to work the destroy everything. poaching or no way that's powerful man we have to meet and to talk to them what's the relation of the reserve and what the regulation of the faxed and they can't do what you're doing so we went to visit them that is called an extraction mining so we start working with them convincing them that we are in the protected area Daddy's regulations Mining and poaching specifically but they said you guys you think that soldier who are dying most important not important and your animals and you are protecting our most important we don't think so you have to do it because to let our movement advance I said no way you're not going to do is here we start working with them and I was negotiating try to protect the equipment try to protect our. stuff and The Villages of about 1500 people and sometimes and sometimes you talk to my own language that is lingala is what strategy doing what you're planning sometimes having El cata to supply them with ammunition and see what they used to me to care that and I was doing accounting what comes from where and where and where not only this equipment my satellite phone my computer and the plastic. solar panel that I hid in the forest and every time daily after we have meeting what compromise and we have whatever I go to write a short email send it I don't know how many people I add on my my address I sent the message what is going about the progress of the war and what they are planning to do they start disrespecting that what we do on the morning and the afternoon is on the news BBC something might be going on and one for a meeting. sorry. when did went meet the chief commander at the swim. Elysium such fun like me and I have never see it I don't know and I didn't do was not hooked on me so I was scared it and when we finish the meeting I went to 3:10 and I was sending news reporting daily to you and to UNESCO to our institution in New York what I've been going and for that they have been having big pressure to live to free the air because there was no way whatever they do it snow in the same times during the first two division they get it all animals in the zoo we have is a 14-0 copies and one of them was pregnant and during the war after a week of every war fighting in the area we succeeded we had the Facebook app. this is not local population this is reversed with the word because we sending you that they're killing poaching and everyone after a week we all celebrated the birthday of. Okay. 50 minutes today where Jesus was born and I was mad I will post it. They are not going to detect it until I do my my my report and then I see the Jeep Commander and I succeeded the elephant that's got the the task what we're doing after that that was the situation of the world we have to rebuild I had some money I was paid $150 to rebuild their bedroom that have good days to start plants conservation Society. modeling with plants $70 and starts fundraising money to where I've been going I had to put in it to go all over there where the bedroom for my African material is and they supported me a bit and I built this now it's doing work to train younger list and also what one of the special issue we are doing my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity and what the impact of the 34s display to update carbon this is one of the statue we are doing on 48th Ave brought where we have typed trees and Rihanna's from 1 cm and we are tracking them that we have no data of one about 15 years to see how that's what it is contributing to the carbon reductions. and that is I think it's a bit. the difficult for me this is a very embarrassing talk I know I don't know where to start where to to finish it when I was thinking to come here what best title I wanted to say it to my truck I didn't find this about tonight I think that I would have taken it the language of gun. why you keep on now we're talkin about the Constitution rebuild Africa but he's done Industries to rebuild or is it again. I think we are. what will we see the world like a game like soccer football every play everybody is happy that see what he's doing see what is going in that food now we say oh my God I see what was in Rwanda that's because of the language of gas I think I don't think that someone made blame Google. cuz he's doing the right things even if people are using Google to connect but it's 7 million for the best. what is going with gun Industries thank you. thank you thank you. it's an amazing story. I suspect a lot of people you have the same question I have at how can we help you. that's really embarrassing question I think I did it myself I did when I was young that's killing elephants and this ring by the diversity I would not have done it. many men you have seen the talents of Africans but there are few who are going to school men are dying because of all those kind of band m h e a v e by building capacities in it like me to go to us do it matter I'm gonna I'm in Nederland to do a PhD but many of them are just here because they don't have money and the boys went to University they can attend bachelor degree building capacity for Young Generation is going to make better generation and better fitted tomorrow for Africa. thank you",,
116,CraigVenter_2005G.sph.wav,but as we look what's out there we've barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet and on the order of ten million viruses less than five thousand microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago and so we decided to do something about it and we started the sorcerer ii expedition where we were as with great oceanographic expeditions trying to sample the ocean every two hundred miles we started in bermuda for our test project then moved up to halifax working down the u s east coast the caribbean sea the panama canal through to the galapagos then across the pacific and we're in the process now of working our way across the indian ocean it's very tough duty we're doing this on a sailing vessel in part to help excite young people about going into science the experiments are incredibly simple we just take seawater and we filter it and we collect different size organisms on different filters and then take their dna back to our lab in rockville where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every twenty four hours and with doing this we've made some amazing discoveries for example it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments it turns out almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photo receptors and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication from one site from one barrel of seawater we discovered one point three million new genes and as many as fifty thousand new species we've extended this to the air now with a grant from the sloan foundation we're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums we filter through some simple apparatuses we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in new york city and we're in the process of sequencing all that at the present time just on the data collection side just where we are through the galapagos we're finding that almost every two hundred miles we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean some of these make logical sense in terms of different temperature gradients so this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures red being warm blue being cold and we found there's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence and these vary tremendously from region to region maybe not surprisingly in the deep ocean where it's mostly blue the photo receptors tend to see blue light what i'm going to tell you about in my eighteen minutes is how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was we assembled all the data and we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are are we just discovering new members of known families or are we discovering new families and it turns out we have about fifty thousand major gene families but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families so we're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes components and life on this planet when we look at the so called evolutionary tree up on the upper right hand corner with the animals of those roughly twenty nine million genes we only have around twenty four thousand in our genome and if you take all animals together we probably share less than thirty thousand and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families i view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution and we think in a gene centric view maybe going back to richard dawkins ideas than in a genome centric view which are different constructs of these gene components synthetic dna the ability to synthesize dna has changed at sort of the same pace that dna sequencing has over it's only ten years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free living organism that of haemophilus influenzae that took a genome project from thirteen years down to four months from mycoplasma genitalium and we have really nice t shirts that say you know i heart my genitalium this is actually just a microorganism so we started doing transposon mutagenesis transposons are just small pieces of dna that randomly insert in the genetic code and if they insert in the middle of the gene they disrupt its function so we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those non essential genes but it turns out the environment is very critical for this and you can only define an essential or non essential gene based on exactly what's in the environment and we got these overlapping circles and we found only one hundred and seventy three genes common to all thirteen organisms the pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of three hundred and ten or so the only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes and we had to do this in a cassette based fashion we found that synthesizing accurate dna in large pieces was extremely difficult ham smith and clyde hutchison my colleagues on this an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a five thousand base pair virus in only a two week period that was one hundred percent accurate in terms of its sequence and its biology it was a quite exciting experiment when we just took the synthetic piece of dna injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden that dna started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria this was not the first synthetic virus a polio virus had been made a year before we can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours so in the last decade a large number of genomes have been added most human pathogens this is a case where the software now builds its own hardware and that's the notions that we have with biology and i think it's important to keep reality in mind versus what happens with people 's imaginations basically any virus that's been sequenced today that genome can be made and people immediately freak out about things about ebola or smallpox but the dna from this organism is not infective so even if somebody made the smallpox genome that dna itself would not cause infections the real concern that security departments have is designer viruses and there's only two countries the u s and the former soviet union that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents if that research is truly discontinued there should be very little activity on the know how to make designer viruses in the future i think single cell organisms are possible within two years and possibly eukaryotic cells those that we have are possible within a decade so we're now making several dozen different constructs because we can vary the cassettes and the genes that go into this artificial chromosome the key is how do you put all of the others we start with these fragments and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome this is derived from an organism deinococcus radiodurans that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed a couple of plants several insects and several mammals including the human genome it reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about twelve to twenty four hours after its chromosomes are literally blown apart this is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation the glass started to burn and crack while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier here 's an actual picture of what happens the top of this shows the genome after one point seven million rads of radiation the chromosome is literally blown apart and here 's that same dna automatically reassembled twenty four hours later it's truly stunning that these organisms can do that doing that after these genomes are synthesized the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome so we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues for example from the third organism we sequenced methanococcus jannaschii it lives in boiling water temperatures its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from co two it captures back from the environment so we know lots of different pathways thousands of different organisms now that live off of co two and can capture that back so instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere converting that into biopolymers or other products we have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen also there's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolising methane and dupont has a major within a short while i think there's going to be a new field called combinatorial genomics because with these new synthesis capabilities these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day and therefore as with all biology you get selection through screening whether you're screening for hydrogen production or chemical production or just viability to understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach we're trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight photosynthesis by oxygen and we have an oxygen insensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process it's on the order of several hundred we just got a grant from the gordon and betty moore foundation to sequence one hundred and thirty genomes this year we're also combining cellulases the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol future engineered species could be the source of food hopefully a source of energy environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry let me just close with ethical and policy studies we delayed every major religion participated in this it was actually a very strange study because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life so it must be ok the only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this right now the sloan foundation has just funded a multi institutional study on this to work out what the risk and benefits to society are and the rules that scientific teams such as my own as a side project from environmental organisms so the rate of reading the genetic code has changed should be using in this area and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward these are complex issues except for the threat of bio terrorism very simple issues in terms of can we design things to produce clean energy perhaps revolutionizing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes thank you very much,1,"at the break I was asked by several people about my comments about the Aging debating this would be my only comment on it and that is I understand that Optimist greatly outlive a pessimist. what I'm going to tell you about it in my 18 minutes is how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves it's only 10 years ago this month when we publish the first sequence of a free living organism that of hemolysis influenza that took a Genome Project from 13 years down to four months we can add to that same Genome Project on the order of 228 hours so in the last decade a large number of genomes have been added most human pathogens a couple of plants are several insects and several mammals including of the human genome. genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over ten years ago was by the end of this year we might have between three and five genome sequenced its on the order of several hundred we just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to sequence 130 genomes this year as a side project from environmental organisms the rate reading the genetic code has changed but as we look without their we've barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet most people don't realize it cuz they're invisible but microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass. where is all animals only make up about 1/1000 of all the biomass and maybe it's something that people on Oxford don't do very often but if you ever make it to the Sea and do a swallow a mouthful of seawater keep in mind that each ml has about a million bacteria and on the order of 10 million of viruses less than 5,000 microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago and so we decided to do something about it then we started the sorcerer to Expedition where where as with great oceanographic Expeditions trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles. we started in Bermuda for a test project then moved up to Halifax working down the US east coast of the Caribbean Sea the Panama Canal due to the Galapagos then across the Pacific over in their process now working their way across the Indian Ocean how it's very tough Duty we're doing this on a sailing vessel and part to help excite young people like going into science experiments are incredibly simple or we just take a sea water and we filter it and we collect different size organisms on different filters and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville where we can sequence 100 million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours and with doing this we've made some amazing discoveries for example if we're stopped at the visual pigments that are in our eyes there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had the same pigments. it turns out almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean and warm parts of the world have the same photoreceptors and you sunlight as the source of their energy and communication from one site from one barrel of seawater we discovered 1.3 million new jeans and as many as 50,000 a new species how we fixed ended this to the air now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation we're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out everyday a particularly on airplanes or close to auditoriums. we filter through some simple apparatus as we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just add a filtering on top of a building in New York City that were in the process of sequencing all that at the present time. just on the data collection side just where we are through the Galapagos refining that almost every two hundred miles we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean some of these make logical sense in terms of different temperature gradients so this is a satellite to photograph based on temperatures red bean warm a blue Bean a cold we found there was a tremendous difference between of the warm water samples and the cold water samples in terms of abundant the species. guessing the surprise is quite a bit useless photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence and these very tremendously from region to region maybe not surprisingly in the deep ocean where it's mostly blue how the photoreceptors at 10 to see blue light when there's a lot of chlorophyll around they see a lot of green light Hub but they vary even more possibly moving towards infrared and UltraViolet in the extremes. just to try and get an assessment of what are Gene repertoire was we assembled all the data including all of ours of us far from the Expedition which represents more than half of all the Jean de there on the planet natal to run 29 million jeans and we tried to put these into Jean families to see what these discoveries are we just discovered a new members of known families are always discovering a new families and it turns out we have about fifty thousand major Gene families but every new sample we taken the environment ads in a linear fashion to these new family show at their earliest stages of discovery about basic jeans components and life on this planet. when we look at the so-called evolutionary tree we're up in the upper right-hand corner with the animals of those roughly a 29 million jeans we only have Ron 24,000 in our genome and if you take all animals together we probably share left some 30,000 and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different Gene families. I view that these jeans are now not only the design components of evolution are we thinking the gene Centric view maybe going back to Richard Dawkins ideas that are in the genome Centric view what your different constructs of these Gene components. synthetic DNA the ability to synthesize DNA's change that sort of the same pace of that DNA sequencing has over the last decade or two and is getting very rapid and very cheap our first thought about 7:30 genomics came when we sequence the second genome back in nineteen ninety-five not from mycoplasma genitalium and we have really nice t-shirts that say you know my heart my genitalia this is actually just a microorganism but it it has roughly 500 jeans homunculus at 1,800 jeans and we simply ask the question if one speaks he needs 800 another 500 is there a smaller set of jeans that might comprise a minimum operating system so we started doing transposon mutagenesis transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly inserted in the genetic code and fat and certain the middle of the gene they just dropped its function. so we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we call those non-essential jeans but it turns out the environment is very critical for this and you can only read the fine and essential and non-essential Jean based on exactly what's in the environment. we also tried to take a more directly and flexible approach with the genomes of 13 related organisms and we tried to compare all of those to see what they had in common and we got these overlapping circles and we found only a hundred and seventy-three jeans common to all 13 organisms the pool expanded a little bit if we ignored when intracellular parasite that expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around three hundred and ten or so so we think that we can expand or contract at Gino's depending on your point of view here two maybe three to four hundred jeans from the minimum of 500 the only way to prove these ideas which to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them and we had to do this in a cassette base fashion we found that synthesize an accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult Pam Smith and Clyde Hutchinson my colleagues on this developing exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a 5000 Bass. virus in only two weeks. That was a hundred percent accurate in terms of its sequence and it's biology it was a quite exciting experiment when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA injected in the bacteria and all of a sudden that DNA started driving to production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed by the bacteria this was not the first time that I get virus of polio virus had been made a year before but it was only one ten thousands of active and it took three years to do this is a cartoon of the structure of fire x 174 this is a case where the software now builds its own hardware and that's the Notions that we have a with Biology. people immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare and I've had recent testimony before a senate committee and a special Committee of the US government has set up to review this area and I think it's important to keep reality in mind versus what happens with people's imaginations basically any virus that's been sequence today that genome I can be made and people immediately freaked out about things about ebola or smallpox but the DNA from those organism is not infective so even if somebody made the smallpox Genome of that DNA itself would not cause infections. the real concern that's security departments have is designer viruses and there's only two countries the US in the former Soviet Union that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents and that research is truly discontinued there should be a very little activity in the know how to make designer viruses in the future I think single cell organisms are possible within two years and possibly eukaryotic cells of those that we have our possible within a decade to wear now making several dozen different constructs because we can vary the cassettes in the jeans that go into this artificial chromosome the key is how do you put all of the others we start with these fragments and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembled sews into a chromosome this is derived from an organism Dyna caucus radiodurans they can take three. a million RADS radiation and not be killed it reassembles its genome after this radiation bursts in about 12 to 24 hours after its chromosomes are literally blown apart this organism is ubiquitous on the planet and they exist perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there this is a glass Beaker after about a half-million RADS radiation the glass started to burn and crack for the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier here's an actual picture what happens the top of this shows the genome after 1.7 million RADS radiation the chromosomes is literally blown apart and here's that same DNA automatically reassembled 24 hours later it's truly stunning that these organisms can do that and we probably have thousands if not tens of thousands of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that after these Jean a synthesized the first step is just transfer. getting them into a cell or without a genome so we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and Society issues for example from the third organism with sequins Montana caucus you nasty I got lives in boiling water temperatures is energy source is hydrogen in all its carbon comes from CO2 captures back from the environment so we know lots of different Pathways thousands of different organisms now that live off of a CO2 can capture that back door instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic process is how we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere and Bernie that into biopolymers or other products. we have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen also there's numerous pathway that can be engineered metabolizing a methane and Dupont has a major program with Statoil and Norway how to capture and convert the methane from the gas Fields they're into useful products within a short while I think there's going to be a new field called combinatorial genomics because with these new synthesis capabilities these vast Gina Ray repertoires and the homologous recombination we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day. and therefore as with all biology you get selection through screening but you're screaming for hydrogen production or chemical production or just buy ability to understand the role of these jeans is going to be well within reach we're trying to modify photosynthesis produce hydrogen directly from sunlight photosynthesis his modulated by oxygen that we have an oxygen insensitive hydrogenase how that we think will totally not change this process process of combining cellulaze has the enzymes that break down complex sugars and two simple sugars and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol pharmaceutical production is already under way in manger Laboratories I using microbes the chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best cameras can produce. I think the future engineered species could be the source of food hopefully a source of energy environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry let me just close with ethical and policy studies we delayed the start of her experiments in 1999 to we completed a year-and-a-half bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species every major religion participated in this it was actually a very strange study because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life so it must be okay the only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this, but gave us the go-ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them right now the Sloan Foundation is just fun today multi-institutional setting on this to work out what the risk. and benefits to society are in the rules at scientific team such as my own should be using in this area and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward these are complex issues except for the threat of bioterrorism they're very simple issues in terms of can we design things to produce clean energy perhaps revolutionising what developing countries can do and provide two very simple processes thank you very much",,
118,CynthiaSchneider_2009G.sph.wav,these programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society in afghanistan people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program and you don't necessarily have to have your own tv set people watch it all over the country also in public places but it goes beyond watching because also part of this is campaigning people become so engaged that they have volunteers just like political volunteers anyway who fan out over the countryside i'd like to ask you what do these three people have in common very conservative part of the country and here she relates in the documentary film afghan star how her friends urged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy but she also confides that she knows that members of the taliban are actually sms ing votes also took risks and put herself out to compete in the poet of the millions competition i have to say her husband backed her from the start but her tribe and family urged her not to compete and were very much against it but once she started to win then they got behind her again it turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value and she's out there her poetry is about women and the life of women in society so just by now you'd think that american idol would introduce a measure of americanization but actually just the opposite is happening by using this engaging popular format for traditional local culture it actually in the gulf is precipitating a revival of interest in nabati poetry also in traditional dress and dance and music and for afghanistan where the taliban banned music for many years it is reintroducing their traditional music they don't sing pop songs they sing afghan music and they also have learned how to lose gracefully without avenging the winner no small thing and the final sort of formulation of this american idol format which has just appeared in afghanistan is a new program called the candidate who is a contestant indeed a finalist in the poet of the millions competition which is broadcast out of abu dahbi and seen throughout the arab world and in this program people present policy platforms that are then voted on many of them are too young to run for president but by putting the issues out there they are influencing the presidential race so for me the substance of things unseen is how reality tv is driving reality thank you in this contest people have to write and recite original poetry in the nabati form of poetry which is the traditional form and lima sahar was a finalist in the afghan star singing competition now before i go any further yes i know it all began with britain 's got talent but my point in discussing this is to show you i hope i'll be able to show you how these merit based competitions with and the arab world with the uae how they're changing tribal societies not by introducing western ideas but by being integrated into the language in those places it all begins with,1,I'd like to ask you what do these three people have in common but you probably recognize the first person I'm sure you're all Abbott American Idol Watchers but you might not recognize I doubt jahani who is a contestant Adida finalist in the poet of the millions competition which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi and seen throughout the Arab world in this contest at people have to write and recite original poetry in the body form of poetry which is a traditional Bedouin form and Lima Sahar was a finalist in the Afghan Star singing competition now before I go any further yes I know it all began with Britain's Got Talent but my point in discussing this is to show you I hope I'll be able to show you how these merit-based competitions with equal access. to everyone with the winner selected by voting Via SMS are changing tribal societies and I'm going to focus on Afghanistan and the Arab world with a view how they're changing tribal societies not by introducing Western ideas but buying being integrated into the language in those places it all begins with enjoyment. these programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society and Afghanistan people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program and you don't necessarily have to have your own TV set people watch it all over the country also in public places but it goes beyond watching because also part of this is campaigning people become so engaged that they have volunteers just like political volunteers anyway who fan out over the countryside campaigning for their candidate the contestants also put themselves forward now and of course there's a certain degree of ethnic Allegiance but not entirely because each year the winter has come from a different tribal group this has opened up the door particularly for women and in the last season they. two women in the finalists one of them Lima Sahar is a punch tune from Kandahar a very conservative part of the country and he or she relates in the documentary film Afghan star top of her friends urged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy but she also confides that she knows that members of the Taliban are actually SMS votes in for her. Ida aljohani also took risks and put herself out to compete in the poet of the millions competition I have to say her husband back to her from the start but her tribe and family Orchard not to compete and we're very much against it but once she started to win then they got behind her again it turns out that no competition and winning is a universal human value and she's out there her poetry is about women and the life of women in society so just by presenting herself and being in competition with men that shows the voting on the program it sets a very important example for young women these are young women in the audience of the program in Abu Dhabi but also people in the viewing audience that you think that American Idol would introduce a measure of Americanization but actually just the opposite is happening by you. disengaging popular format for traditional local culture it actually in the Gulf is precipitating a Revival of interest in the body poetry also in traditional dress and dance and music and for Afghanistan where the Taliban band music for many years it is reinforcing their traditional music they don't sing pop songs they sing Afghan music and they also have learned how to lose gracefully without avenging the winner and the and the final the finals are formulation of this American Idol format which is just appeared in Afghanistan is a new program called the candidate and in this program people present policy platforms that are then voted on many of them are too young to run for president but by putting the issues out. they are they are influencing the presidential race so for me the substance of things unseen is how reality TV is driving reality thank you. traffic is a global epidemic traffic is creating 45% of the world's pollution in the UK time wasted in traffic cost 20 billion a year would you place a clean the false the commute Stockholm put it to a vote vote vote is for it. how to do something install come to improve the environment and to get the better of a flow in the traffic will put a price on taking your car into the center Palo Alto stock on a cold that congestion charges. if you stop a system like this and doesn't work on the first day then you will be in big trouble it must be perfect from Davon. there are teaching them tickets to the city each is equipped with cameras on the rear and front license plates these pictures are sent to Central system that identifies the license plates and make sure that the right person pays for the right passages of the license plate we went out IBM's Global organization and the R&D centres and find a very good software we could use a weight management Limited in two months time going to 9% of old pictures are correct identified. nice guys this is how it should be all the time you can see the traffic of the truck is 6 p.m. before we have the congestion charge in the traffic was chewing up at this time of day it is I think it's a good idea because I think that we should it take care of the environment in the CD is about 40% better it is huge International interest from different parts of the world from the United States from Latin America from China and its really pretty sure to tell people no pork we're planning to do what we're actually have done install come she is not thinking like me for. the future I'm thinking for the children and their grandchildren,,
