so it's about choosing the parts of the bible about compassion about tolerance about loving your neighbor as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin or intolerance or violence which are very much in the bible as well so if we are to find any meaning in this book then we have to really engage it and wrestle with it and i thought i'd end with just a couple more there's me reading the bible that's how i hailed taxi cabs morning but it served well for a day so anyway thank you so much for letting me so and it was about the year i spent reading the encyclopedia britannica from a to z in my quest to learn everything in the world or more precisely from which is a type of east asian music all the way to zwyiec which is well i don't although listening to kevin kelly you don't have to remember anything you can just google it so i wasted some time there i love those experiments but i think that the most profound and life changing experiment that i've done is my most recent experiment i thought i'd tell you a little about what i like to write and i like to immerse myself in my topics i just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig and where i spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the bible the year of living biblically and i undertook this for two reasons the first was that i grew up with no religion at all as i say in my book i'm jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian so but i've become increasingly interested in religion i do think it's the defining issue of our time or one of the main ones and i have a son i want to know what to teach him so i decided to dive in head first and try to live the bible the second reason i undertook this is because i'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism religious fundamentalism and people who say what if you really did take the bible literally i decided to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the bible literally without picking and choosing the first thing i did was i got a stack of bibles i had christian bibles i had jewish bibles a friend of mine sent me something called a hip hop bible where the twenty three rd psalm is rendered as the lord is all that as opposed to what i knew it as the lord is my shepherd then i went down and i read several versions and i wrote down every single law that i could find and this was a very long list over seven hundred rules and they range from the famous ones that i had heard of the ten commandments love your neighbor be fruitful and multiply so i wanted to follow those and actually i take my projects very seriously because i had twins during my year so i definitely take my projects seriously but i also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the bible there is the law in leviticus you cannot shave the corners of your beard i didn't know where my corners were so i decided to let the whole thing grow and this is what i looked like by the end as you can imagine i spent a lot of time at airport security my wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months so certainly the challenge was there the bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers so i thought sounds strange but i'll try it you only know i see my life as a series of experiments so i work for esquire magazine and a couple of years ago i wrote an article called my outsourced life i got rid of all my poly cotton t shirts the bible says that if two men are in a fight and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other her hand shall be cut off so i wanted to follow that rule wife was standing nearby looking like she had a strong grip so there's another shot of my beard i will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing and incredibly challenging and there were two types of laws were particularly challenging the first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day know i could spend a year not killing but spending a year not gossiping not coveting not lying you know i live in new york and i work as a journalist so this was seventy five eighty percent of my but it was really interesting because i was able to make some progress because i couldn't believe how my behavior changed my thoughts this was one of the huge lessons of the year is that i almost pretended to be a better person and i became a little bit of a better person so i had always thought you know you change your mind and you change your behavior but it's often the other way round you change your behavior and you change your mind so you know if you want to become more compassionate you visit sick people in the hospital and you will become more compassionate where i hired a team of people in bangalore india to live my life for me so they answered my emails they answered my phone they argued with my wife for me and they you donate money to a cause and you become emotionally involved in that cause so it really was cognitive psychology that if you smile you will become happier which as we know is actually true the second type of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty one st century america and the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers but it's a big part of the bible so i had to address i was able to stone one adulterer it happened i was in the park and i was dressed in my biblical clothing sandals and a white robe you know because again the outer see how dressing biblically affected my mind up to me and he said why are you dressed like that and i explained my project and he said well i am an adulterer are you going to stone me and i said well that would be great and i took out a handful of stones from my pocket that i had been carrying around for weeks hoping for just this interaction and you know they were pebbles out of my hand he was actually an elderly man mid seventies just so you know but he 's still an adulterer and still quite angry he grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face and i felt that i could eye for an eye i could retaliate and throw one back at him so that was my experience stoning and it did allow me to talk about in a more serious way these big issues how can the bible be so barbaric in some places and yet so incredibly wise in others it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years and it's sort of evolved it's not a book that was written and came down from on high my son bedtime stories it was the best month of my life because i just sat back and i read books and watched movies so i thought i would end by telling you just a couple of the take away the bigger lessons that i learned from my year the first is thou shalt not take the bible literally this very very clear early on because if you do then you end up acting like a crazy person and stoning adulterers or here well that's another i did spend some time shepherding it's a very relaxing vocation i recommend it but this one is and my wife thought this was very offensive so she sat in every seat in our apartment and i had to spend much of the year standing until i bought my own seat and carried it around so you know i met with creationists i went to the creationists museum and these are the ultimate literalists and it was fascinating because they were not stupid people at all that they distort all the data to fit their model and they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this and i will say though was a wonderful experience more recently i wrote an article for esquire called about radical honesty and this is a movement the museum is gorgeous they really did a fantastic job if you're ever in kentucky there's i think it's crazy they did a great job another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks and this one was a big lesson because i was praying giving these prayers of thanksgiving which was odd for an agnostic but saying thanks all the time every day and i started to change my perspective and i started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day that i didn't even notice that i took for granted as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong so this is actually a key to happiness for me is to just remember when i came over here the car didn't flip over and i didn't trip coming up the stairs it's a remarkable thing this one was unexpected because i started the year as an agnostic and by the end of the year i became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic which i love a movement so if anyone wants to join the basic idea is whether or not there is a god there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness and that our rituals can be sacred the sabbath can be this was one of the great things about my year doing the sabbath because i am a workaholic so having this one day where you cannot work it really that changed my life this is started by a psychologist in virginia who says that you should never ever lie except maybe during poker and golf his only exceptions and more than that journey i wanted it to be about religion in america so i spent time with evangelical christians and hasidic jews and the i'm very proud because i think i'm the only person in america to out bible talk a jehovah 's witness thank you but it was because i had some very preconceived notions about for instance evangelical christianity and i found that it's such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it there's a group i met with called the red letter christians and they focus on words in the bible which are the ones that jesus spoke that's how they printed them in the old bibles and is that jesus never talked about homosexuality they have a pamphlet that says here 's what jesus said about homosexuality and you open it up and there's nothing in it so they say jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts helping poor people so this was very inspiring to me i recommend jim wallace and tony campolo they're very inspiring leaders even though i disagree with much of what they say also thou shalt not i was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces and the thing is if they're not harmful they're not to be completely dismissed because i learned that i was thinking i was doing all these rituals these biblical rituals separating my and linen and i would ask these religious people why would the bible possibly tell us to do this why would god care and they said we don't know but it's just rituals that give us meaning and i would say but that's crazy and they would say well what about you you blow out candles on top of a birthday cake if a guy from mars came down and saw here 's one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics would the martians say well that he makes sense but that guy 's crazy so no i think that are not harmful but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed and finally i learned that thou shall pick and choose and this one i learned because i tried to follow everything in the bible and i failed miserably because you can 't you have to pick and choose and anyone who follows the bible is going to be picking and choosing the key is i do not recommend this at all to give you a sense of the experience the article was called i think you're fat to pick and choose the right parts there's the phrase called my argument is what 's wrong with cafeterias i've had some great meals at cafeterias\n","qualiti horribl xxx xxx want review
